watercraft, outboard motor, or aircraft, or of any tangible 2938
personal property, other than motor vehicles designed by the 2939
manufacturer to carry a load of more than one ton, to be used by 2940
the lessee or renter primarily for business purposes, the tax 2941
shall be collected by the vendor at the time the lease or rental 2942
is consummated and shall be calculated by the vendor on the 2943
basis of the total amount to be paid by the lessee or renter 2944

length of the lease period, including any renewal periods, until 2961
the termination penalty or similar provision no longer applies. 2962
The taxpayer shall bear the burden, by a preponderance of the 2963
evidence, that the transaction or series of transactions is not 2964

in part of the lease or rental of tangible personal property, 2968
the tax shall be measured by the installments of that lease or 2969
rental. 2970
(4) In the case of a sale of a physical fitness facility 2971
service or recreation and sports club service, the price of 2972
which consists in whole or in part of a membership for the 2973
receipt of the benefit of the service, the tax applicable to the 2974
sale shall be measured by the installments thereof. 2975
(B) The tax does not apply to the following: 2976
(1) Sales to the state or any of its political 2977
subdivisions, or to any other state or its political 2978
subdivisions if the laws of that state exempt from taxation 2979

(A) A municipal corporation shall require the following 31

(B) If a person's winnings at a casino facility or sports 44
gaming facility are an amount for which reporting to the 45
internal revenue service of the amount is required by section 46
6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, a casino operator 47
or sports gaming proprietor shall deduct and withhold municipal 48
income tax from the person's winnings at the rate of the tax 49
imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino 50

H. B. No. 344 Page 3
As Introduced
facility or sports gaming facility is located. 51
(C) Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator or 52
sports gaming proprietor are held in trust for the benefit of 53
the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed. 54
(1) On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino 55
operator or sports gaming proprietor shall file a return 56
electronically with the tax administrator of the municipal 57
corporation, providing the name, address, and social security 58
number of the person from whose winnings amounts were deducted 59
and withheld, the amount of each such deduction and withholding 60
during the preceding calendar month, the amount of the winnings 61
from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino 62
gaming or sports gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any 63
other information required by the tax administrator. With this 64
return, the casino operator or sports gaming proprietor shall 65
remit electronically to the municipal corporation all amounts 66
deducted and withheld during the preceding month. 67
(2) Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of 68

H. B. No. 344 Page 4
As Introduced
(3) Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of 81
January, a casino operator or sports gaming proprietor shall 82
issue an information return to each person with respect to whom 83
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding 84
calendar year. The information return shall show the total 85
amount of municipal income tax deducted from the person's 86
winnings during the preceding year. The casino operator or 87
sports gaming proprietor shall provide to the tax administrator 88
a copy of each information return issued under this division. 89
The administrator may require that such copies be transmitted 90

(4) A casino operator or sports gaming proprietor that 92
fails to file a return and remit the amounts deducted and 93

interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late 96
payment of tax deducted and withheld. 97
(5) If a casino operator or sports gaming proprietor sells 98
the casino facility or sports gaming facility, or otherwise 99
quits the casino or sports gaming business, the amounts deducted 100
and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon are 101
immediately due and payable. The successor shall withhold an 102

amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and 104
interest thereon until the predecessor casino operator or sports 105
gaming proprietor produces either of the following: 106
(a) A receipt from the tax administrator showing that the 107
amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon 108
have been paid; 109

that no amounts are due. 111
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the 112
successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts 113
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon. 114
(6) The failure of a casino operator or sports gaming 115
proprietor to deduct and withhold the required amount from a 116
person's winnings does not relieve that person from liability 117
for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings. 118
(D) If a person's prize award from a video lottery 119
terminal or from lottery sports gaming offered in a video 120
lottery terminal facility or retailer video lottery terminal is 121
an amount for which reporting to the internal revenue service is 122
required by section 6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as 123
amended, the video lottery sales agent or retailer video lottery 124
terminal operator shall deduct and withhold municipal income tax 125
from the person's prize award at the rate of the tax imposed by 126
the municipal corporation in which the video lottery terminal 127
facility or retailer video lottery terminal establishment is 128
located. 129
(E) Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales 130
agent or retailer video lottery terminal operator are held in 131
trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the 132
tax is owed. 133
(1) The video lottery sales agent or retailer video 134
lottery terminal operator shall issue to a person from whose 135
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt 136
for the amount deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the 137
person receiving a prize award the person's name, address, and 138
social security number in order to facilitate the preparation of 139

H. B. No. 344 Page 6

(2) On or before the tenth day of each month, the video 141
lottery sales agent or retailer video lottery terminal operator 142
shall file a return electronically with the tax administrator of 143
the municipal corporation providing the names, addresses, and 144

amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such 146
deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, 147
the amount of the prize award from which each such amount was 148
withheld, and any other information required by the tax 149
administrator. With the return, the video lottery sales agent or 150
operator shall remit electronically to the tax administrator all 151
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month. 152
(3) A video lottery sales agent or retailer video lottery 153
terminal operator shall maintain a record of all receipts issued 154
under division (E) of this section and shall make those records 155
available to the tax administrator upon request. Such records 156
shall be maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the 157

the tax levied under section 5753.02 or , 5753.021, or 5753.022 4222
of the Revised Code will be jeopardized unless proceedings to 4223
collect or secure collection of the tax are instituted without 4224
delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment against 4225
the taxpayer that is liable for the tax. Immediately upon the 4226
issuance of a jeopardy assessment, the tax commissioner shall 4227
file an entry with the clerk of the court of common pleas in the 4228
manner prescribed by division (A)(4) of this section, and the 4229

under this section, and the amounts forwarded shall be treated 4246

tax due, and may issue an assessment based on the audit. The tax 4269
commissioner shall make a good faith effort to reach agreement 4270
with the taxpayer in selecting a representative sample. The tax 4271
commissioner may apply a sampling method only if the tax 4272
commissioner has prescribed the method by rule. 4273
(F) If the whereabouts of a taxpayer who is liable for the 4274
tax levied under section 5753.02 or , 5753.021, or 5753.022 of 4275
the Revised Code are unknown to the tax commissioner, the tax 4276
