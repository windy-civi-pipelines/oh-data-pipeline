nonpublic school under section 5747.75 of the Revised Code; 1256
(q) The thriving families tax credit under section 5747.36 1257

(3) The election provided for under division (D) of this 1259

Section 62:
section applies only to the taxable year for which the election 1260
is made by the pass-through entity. Unless the tax commissioner 1261
provides otherwise, this election, once made, is binding and 1262
irrevocable for the taxable year for which the election is made. 1263
Nothing in this division shall be construed to provide for any 1264
deduction or credit that would not be allowable if a nonresident 1265
pass-through entity investor were to file an annual return. 1266

(4) If a pass-through entity makes the election provided 1267
for under division (D) of this section, the pass-through entity 1268
shall be liable for any additional taxes, interest, interest 1269
penalty, or penalties imposed by this chapter if the tax 1270
commissioner finds that the single return does not reflect the 1271
correct tax due by the pass-through entity investors covered by 1272
that return. Nothing in this division shall be construed to 1273
limit or alter the liability, if any, imposed on pass-through 1274
entity investors for unpaid or underpaid taxes, interest, 1275
interest penalty, or penalties as a result of the pass-through 1276
entity's making the election provided for under division (D) of 1277
this section. For the purposes of division (D) of this section, 1278
"correct tax due" means the tax that would have been paid by the 1279
pass-through entity had the single return been filed in a manner 1280
reflecting the commissioner's findings. Nothing in division (D) 1281
of this section shall be construed to make or hold a pass- 1282
through entity liable for tax attributable to a pass-through 1283
entity investor's income from a source other than the pass- 1284
through entity electing to file the single return. 1285
(E) If a husband and wife file a joint federal income tax 1286
return for a taxable year, they shall file a joint return under 1287
this section for that taxable year, and their liabilities are 1288
joint and several, but, if the federal income tax liability of 1289
either spouse is determined on a separate federal income tax 1290
return, they shall file separate returns under this section. 1291
If either spouse is not required to file a federal income 1292
tax return and either or both are required to file a return 1293
pursuant to this chapter, they may elect to file separate or 1294
joint returns, and, pursuant to that election, their liabilities 1295
are separate or joint and several. If a husband and wife file 1296
separate returns pursuant to this chapter, each must claim the 1297

taxpayer's own exemption, but not both, as authorized under 1298

Section 63:
section 5747.02 of the Revised Code on the taxpayer's own 1299
return. 1300
(F) Each return or notice required to be filed under this 1301

Section 64:
section shall contain the signature of the taxpayer or the 1302
taxpayer's duly authorized agent and of the person who prepared 1303
the return for the taxpayer, and shall include the taxpayer's 1304
social security number. Each return shall be verified by a 1305
declaration under the penalties of perjury. The tax commissioner 1306
shall prescribe the form that the signature and declaration 1307
shall take. 1308
(G) Each return or notice required to be filed under this 1309

Section 65:
section shall be made and filed as required by section 5747.04 1310
of the Revised Code, on or before the fifteenth day of April of 1311
each year, on forms that the tax commissioner shall prescribe, 1312
together with remittance made payable to the treasurer of state 1313
in the combined amount of the state and all school district 1314
income taxes shown to be due on the form. 1315
Upon good cause shown, the commissioner may extend the 1316
period for filing any notice or return required to be filed 1317
under this section and may adopt rules relating to extensions. 1318
If the extension results in an extension of time for the payment 1319
of any state or school district income tax liability with 1320
respect to which the return is filed, the taxpayer shall pay at 1321
the time the tax liability is paid an amount of interest 1322
computed at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of 1323
the Revised Code on that liability from the time that payment is 1324
due without extension to the time of actual payment. Except as 1325
provided in section 5747.132 of the Revised Code, in addition to 1326
all other interest charges and penalties, all taxes imposed 1327
H. B. No. 140 Page 47

remaining unpaid after they become due, except combined amounts 1329
due of one dollar or less, bear interest at the rate per annum 1330
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code until paid or 1331
until the day an assessment is issued under section 5747.13 of 1332
the Revised Code, whichever occurs first. 1333
If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to 1334
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by section 5747.02 of the 1335
Revised Code or any tax imposed under Chapter 5748. of the 1336
Revised Code, the commissioner may require returns and payments 1337
to be made otherwise than as provided in this section. 1338
To the extent that any provision in this division 1339
conflicts with any provision in section 5747.026 of the Revised 1340
Code, the provision in that section prevails. 1341
(H) The amounts withheld pursuant to section 5747.06, 1342

Section 66:
5747.062, 5747.063, 5747.064, 5747.065, or 5747.071 of the 1343
Revised Code shall be allowed to the ultimate recipient of the 1344
income as credits against payment of the appropriate taxes 1345
imposed on the ultimate recipient by section 5747.02 and under 1346
Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code. As used in this division, 1347
"ultimate recipient" means the person who is required to report 1348
income from which amounts are withheld pursuant to section 1349

Section 67:
5747.06, 5747.062, 5747.063, 5747.064, 5747.065, or 5747.071 of 1350
the Revised Code on the annual return required to be filed under 1351
this section. 1352
(I) If a pass-through entity elects to file a single 1353
return under division (D) of this section and if any investor is 1354
required to file the annual return and make the payment of taxes 1355
required by this chapter on account of the investor's other 1356
income that is not included in a single return filed by a pass- 1357
H. B. No. 140 Page 48
As Introduced
through entity or any other investor elects to file the annual 1358
return, the investor is entitled to a refundable credit equal to 1359
the investor's proportionate share of the tax paid by the pass- 1360
through entity on behalf of the investor. The investor shall 1361
claim the credit for the investor's taxable year in which or 1362
with which ends the taxable year of the pass-through entity. 1363
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow any credit 1364
provided in this chapter to be claimed more than once. For the 1365
purpose of computing any interest, penalty, or interest penalty, 1366
the investor shall be deemed to have paid the refundable credit 1367
provided by this division on the day that the pass-through 1368
entity paid the estimated tax or the tax giving rise to the 1369
credit. 1370
(J) The tax commissioner shall ensure that each return 1371
required to be filed under this section includes a box that the 1372
taxpayer may check to authorize a paid tax preparer who prepared 1373
the return to communicate with the department of taxation about 1374
matters pertaining to the return. The return or instructions 1375
accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box 1376
the taxpayer authorizes the department of taxation to contact 1377
the preparer concerning questions that arise during the 1378
processing of the return and authorizes the preparer only to 1379
provide the department with information that is missing from the 1380
return, to contact the department for information about the 1381
processing of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund 1382
or payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical 1383
errors, offsets, or return preparation that the taxpayer has 1384
received from the department and has shown to the preparer. 1385
(K) The tax commissioner shall permit individual taxpayers 1386

overpaid taxes to be deposited directly into a checking account, 1388

(L) If, for the taxable year, a nonresident or trust that 1395
is the owner of an electing pass-through entity, as defined in 1396

Section 68:
section 5747.38 of the Revised Code, does not have Ohio adjusted 1397
gross income or, in the case of a trust, modified Ohio taxable 1398
income other than from one or more electing pass-through 1399
entities, the nonresident or trust shall not be required to file 1400
an annual return under this section. Nothing in this division 1401
precludes such an owner from filing the annual return under this 1402

Section 69:
section, utilizing the refundable credit under section 5747.39 1403

state, other than this state and its subdivisions and 25
authorities. 26

As Introduced
(b) Railroad retirement benefits, other than tier 1 45
railroad retirement benefits, to the extent such amounts are 46
exempt from state taxation under federal law. 47
(6) Deduct the amount of wages and salaries, if any, not 48
otherwise allowable as a deduction but that would have been 49
allowable as a deduction in computing federal adjusted gross 50
income for the taxable year, had the work opportunity tax credit 51
allowed and determined under sections 38, 51, and 52 of the 52
Internal Revenue Code not been in effect. 53
(7) Deduct any interest or interest equivalent on public 54
obligations and purchase obligations to the extent that the 55
interest or interest equivalent is included in federal adjusted 56
gross income. 57
(8) Add any loss or deduct any gain resulting from the 58
sale, exchange, or other disposition of public obligations to 59
the extent that the loss has been deducted or the gain has been 60
included in computing federal adjusted gross income. 61
(9) Deduct or add amounts, as provided under section 62
5747.70 of the Revised Code, related to contributions made to or 63
tuition units purchased under a qualified tuition program 64
established pursuant to section 529 of the Internal Revenue 65
Code. 66
(10)(a) Deduct, to the extent not otherwise allowable as a 67
deduction or exclusion in computing federal or Ohio adjusted 68
gross income for the taxable year, the amount the taxpayer paid 69
during the taxable year for medical care insurance and qualified 70
long-term care insurance for the taxpayer, the taxpayer's 71
spouse, and dependents. No deduction for medical care insurance 72
under division (A)(10)(a) of this section shall be allowed 73

H. B. No. 140 Page 4
As Introduced
either to any taxpayer who is eligible to participate in any 74
subsidized health plan maintained by any employer of the 75
taxpayer or of the taxpayer's spouse, or to any taxpayer who is 76
entitled to, or on application would be entitled to, benefits 77
under part A of Title XVIII of the "Social Security Act," 49 78
Stat. 620 (1935), 42 U.S.C. 301, as amended. For the purposes of 79
division (A)(10)(a) of this section, "subsidized health plan" 80
means a health plan for which the employer pays any portion of 81
the plan's cost. The deduction allowed under division (A)(10)(a) 82
of this section shall be the net of any related premium refunds, 83
related premium reimbursements, or related insurance premium 84
dividends received during the taxable year. 85
(b) Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or 86
excluded in computing federal or Ohio adjusted gross income 87
during the taxable year, the amount the taxpayer paid during the 88
taxable year, not compensated for by any insurance or otherwise, 89
for medical care of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, and 90
dependents, to the extent the expenses exceed seven and one-half 91
per cent of the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income. 92
(c) For purposes of division (A)(10) of this section, 93
"medical care" has the meaning given in section 213 of the 94
Internal Revenue Code, subject to the special rules, 95
limitations, and exclusions set forth therein, and "qualified 96
long-term care" has the same meaning given in section 7702B(c) 97
of the Internal Revenue Code. Solely for purposes of division 98
(A)(10)(a) of this section, "dependent" includes a person who 99
otherwise would be a "qualifying relative" and thus a 100
"dependent" under section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code but 101
for the fact that the person fails to meet the income and 102
support limitations under section 152(d)(1)(B) and (C) of the 103
Internal Revenue Code. 104

H. B. No. 140 Page 5
As Introduced
(11)(a) Deduct any amount included in federal adjusted 105
gross income solely because the amount represents a 106
reimbursement or refund of expenses that in any year the 107
taxpayer had deducted as an itemized deduction pursuant to 108
section 63 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable United 109
States department of the treasury regulations. The deduction 110
otherwise allowed under division (A)(11)(a) of this section 111
shall be reduced to the extent the reimbursement is attributable 112
to an amount the taxpayer deducted under this section in any 113
taxable year. 114
(b) Add any amount not otherwise included in Ohio adjusted 115
gross income for any taxable year to the extent that the amount 116
is attributable to the recovery during the taxable year of any 117
amount deducted or excluded in computing federal or Ohio 118
adjusted gross income in any taxable year. 119
(12) Deduct any portion of the deduction described in 120
section 1341(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, for repaying 121
previously reported income received under a claim of right, that 122
meets both of the following requirements: 123
(a) It is allowable for repayment of an item that was 124
included in the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for a prior 125
taxable year and did not qualify for a credit under division (A) 126
or (B) of section 5747.05 of the Revised Code for that year; 127
(b) It does not otherwise reduce the taxpayer's adjusted 128
gross income for the current or any other taxable year. 129
(13) Deduct an amount equal to the deposits made to, and 130
net investment earnings of, a medical savings account during the 131
taxable year, in accordance with section 3924.66 of the Revised 132
Code. The deduction allowed by division (A)(13) of this section 133

H. B. No. 140 Page 6

does not apply to medical savings account deposits and earnings 134
otherwise deducted or excluded for the current or any other 135
taxable year from the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income. 136
(14)(a) Add an amount equal to the funds withdrawn from a 137
medical savings account during the taxable year, and the net 138
investment earnings on those funds, when the funds withdrawn 139
were used for any purpose other than to reimburse an account 140
holder for, or to pay, eligible medical expenses, in accordance 141
with section 3924.66 of the Revised Code; 142
(b) Add the amounts distributed from a medical savings 143
account under division (A)(2) of section 3924.68 of the Revised 144
Code during the taxable year. 145
(15) Add any amount claimed as a credit under section 146
5747.059 of the Revised Code to the extent that such amount 147
satisfies either of the following: 148
(a) The amount was deducted or excluded from the 149
computation of the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income as 150
required to be reported for the taxpayer's taxable year under 151
the Internal Revenue Code; 152
(b) The amount resulted in a reduction of the taxpayer's 153
federal adjusted gross income as required to be reported for any 154
of the taxpayer's taxable years under the Internal Revenue Code. 155
(16) Deduct the amount contributed by the taxpayer to an 156
individual development account program established by a county 157
department of job and family services pursuant to sections 158
329.11 to 329.14 of the Revised Code for the purpose of matching 159
funds deposited by program participants. On request of the tax 160
commissioner, the taxpayer shall provide any information that, 161
in the tax commissioner's opinion, is necessary to establish the 162

increase in income taxes withheld by the taxpayer is equal to or 181
greater than ten per cent of income taxes withheld by the 182
taxpayer during the taxpayer's immediately preceding taxable 183
year, "two-thirds" shall be substituted for "five-sixths" for 184
the purpose of divisions (A)(17)(a)(i) and (ii) of this section. 185

for taxable years beginning in 2012 or thereafter, a taxpayer is 187
not required to add an amount under division (A)(17) of this 188
section if the increase in income taxes withheld by the taxpayer 189

any such pass-through entities. 197
(v) If a taxpayer directly or indirectly incurs a net 198
operating loss for the taxable year for federal income tax 199
purposes, to the extent such loss resulted from depreciation 200
expense allowed by subsection (k) of section 168 of the Internal 201
Revenue Code and by qualifying section 179 depreciation expense, 202
"the entire" shall be substituted for "five-sixths of the" for 203

five per cent of the pass-through entity. 208
(b) Nothing in division (A)(17) of this section shall be 209
construed to adjust or modify the adjusted basis of any asset. 210
(c) To the extent the add-back required under division (A) 211
(17)(a) of this section is attributable to property generating 212
nonbusiness income or loss allocated under section 5747.20 of 213
the Revised Code, the add-back shall be sitused to the same 214
location as the nonbusiness income or loss generated by the 215
property for the purpose of determining the credit under 216
division (A) of section 5747.05 of the Revised Code. Otherwise, 217
the add-back shall be apportioned, subject to one or more of the 218
four alternative methods of apportionment enumerated in section 219
5747.21 of the Revised Code. 220

section, net operating loss carryback and carryforward shall not 222
include the allowance of any net operating loss deduction 223
carryback or carryforward to the taxable year to the extent such 224

Internal Revenue Code and by the qualifying section 179 226

section: 229
(i) "Income taxes withheld" means the total amount 230

Revised Code by an employer during the employer's taxable year. 232
(ii) "Increase in income taxes withheld" means the amount 233
by which the amount of income taxes withheld by an employer 234
during the employer's current taxable year exceeds the amount of 235
income taxes withheld by that employer during the employer's 236
immediately preceding taxable year. 237
(iii) "Qualifying section 179 depreciation expense" means 238
the difference between (I) the amount of depreciation expense 239
directly or indirectly allowed to a taxpayer under section 179 240
of the Internal Revised Code, and (II) the amount of 241
depreciation expense directly or indirectly allowed to the 242
taxpayer under section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code as that 243
section existed on December 31, 2002. 244
(18)(a) If the taxpayer was required to add an amount 245
under division (A)(17)(a) of this section for a taxable year, 246
deduct one of the following: 247
(i) One-fifth of the amount so added for each of the five 248
succeeding taxable years if the amount so added was five-sixths 249
of qualifying section 179 depreciation expense or depreciation 250

expense allowed by subsection (k) of section 168 of the Internal 251
Revenue Code; 252
(ii) One-half of the amount so added for each of the two 253
succeeding taxable years if the amount so added was two-thirds 254
of such depreciation expense; 255
(iii) One-sixth of the amount so added for each of the six 256
succeeding taxable years if the entire amount of such 257
depreciation expense was so added. 258
(b) If the amount deducted under division (A)(18)(a) of 259
this section is attributable to an add-back allocated under 260
division (A)(17)(c) of this section, the amount deducted shall 261
be sitused to the same location. Otherwise, the add-back shall 262
be apportioned using the apportionment factors for the taxable 263
year in which the deduction is taken, subject to one or more of 264
the four alternative methods of apportionment enumerated in 265
section 5747.21 of the Revised Code. 266
(c) No deduction is available under division (A)(18)(a) of 267
this section with regard to any depreciation allowed by section 268
168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and by the qualifying 269
section 179 depreciation expense amount to the extent that such 270
depreciation results in or increases a federal net operating 271
loss carryback or carryforward. If no such deduction is 272
available for a taxable year, the taxpayer may carry forward the 273
amount not deducted in such taxable year to the next taxable 274
year and add that amount to any deduction otherwise available 275
under division (A)(18)(a) of this section for that next taxable 276
year. The carryforward of amounts not so deducted shall continue 277
until the entire addition required by division (A)(17)(a) of 278
this section has been deducted. 279

other identifying number of each of those pass-through entity 1174
investors and shall indicate the distributive share of each of 1175
those pass-through entity investor's income taxable in this 1176
state in accordance with sections 5747.20 to 5747.231 of the 1177
Revised Code. Such pass-through entity investors for whom the 1178
pass-through entity elects to file a single return are not 1179
entitled to the exemption or credit provided for by sections 1180
5747.02 and 5747.022 of the Revised Code; shall calculate the 1181

which the return is filed; and are entitled to only their 1184
distributive share of the business credits as defined in 1185
division (D)(2) of this section. A single check drawn by the 1186
pass-through entity shall accompany the return in full payment 1187
of the tax due, as shown on the single return, for such 1188
investors, other than investors who are persons subject to the 1189
tax imposed under section 5733.06 of the Revised Code. 1190
(b)(i) A pass-through entity shall not include in such a 1191

any direct or indirect current, future, or contingent 1193
beneficiary of the trust is a person subject to the tax imposed 1194
under section 5733.06 of the Revised Code. 1195
(ii) A pass-through entity shall not include in such a 1196
single return any investor that is itself a pass-through entity 1197
to the extent that any direct or indirect investor in the second 1198
pass-through entity is a person subject to the tax imposed under 1199
section 5733.06 of the Revised Code. 1200
(c) Except as provided by division (L) of this section, 1201
nothing in division (D) of this section precludes the tax 1202
commissioner from requiring such investors to file the return 1203
and make the payment of taxes and related interest, penalty, and 1204
interest penalty required by this section or section 5747.02, 1205
5747.09, or 5747.15 of the Revised Code. Nothing in division (D) 1206
of this section precludes such an investor from filing the 1207
annual return under this section, utilizing the refundable 1208
credit equal to the investor's proportionate share of the tax 1209
paid by the pass-through entity on behalf of the investor under 1210
division (I) of this section, and making the payment of taxes 1211

or credit, other than the credit provided by division (I) of 1215
this section, solely on account of the entity's filing a return 1216
in accordance with this section. Such a pass-through entity also 1217
shall make the filing and payment of estimated taxes on behalf 1218
of the pass-through entity investors other than an investor that 1219
is a person subject to the tax imposed under section 5733.06 of 1220
the Revised Code. 1221

division (B) of section 5747.05 of the Revised Code; 1248
(m) The earned income tax credit under section 5747.71 of 1249
the Revised Code; 1250
(n) The lead abatement credit under section 5747.26 of the 1251
Revised Code; 1252
(o) The credit for education expenses under section 1253

nonpublic school under section 5747.75 of the Revised Code; 1256
(q) The thriving families tax credit under section 5747.36 1257
of the Revised Code. 1258
(3) The election provided for under division (D) of this 1259
section applies only to the taxable year for which the election 1260
is made by the pass-through entity. Unless the tax commissioner 1261
provides otherwise, this election, once made, is binding and 1262
irrevocable for the taxable year for which the election is made. 1263
Nothing in this division shall be construed to provide for any 1264
deduction or credit that would not be allowable if a nonresident 1265
pass-through entity investor were to file an annual return. 1266

(4) If a pass-through entity makes the election provided 1267
for under division (D) of this section, the pass-through entity 1268
shall be liable for any additional taxes, interest, interest 1269
penalty, or penalties imposed by this chapter if the tax 1270
commissioner finds that the single return does not reflect the 1271
correct tax due by the pass-through entity investors covered by 1272
that return. Nothing in this division shall be construed to 1273
limit or alter the liability, if any, imposed on pass-through 1274
entity investors for unpaid or underpaid taxes, interest, 1275
interest penalty, or penalties as a result of the pass-through 1276
entity's making the election provided for under division (D) of 1277
this section. For the purposes of division (D) of this section, 1278
"correct tax due" means the tax that would have been paid by the 1279
pass-through entity had the single return been filed in a manner 1280
reflecting the commissioner's findings. Nothing in division (D) 1281
of this section shall be construed to make or hold a pass- 1282
through entity liable for tax attributable to a pass-through 1283
entity investor's income from a source other than the pass- 1284
through entity electing to file the single return. 1285
(E) If a husband and wife file a joint federal income tax 1286
return for a taxable year, they shall file a joint return under 1287
this section for that taxable year, and their liabilities are 1288
joint and several, but, if the federal income tax liability of 1289
either spouse is determined on a separate federal income tax 1290
return, they shall file separate returns under this section. 1291
If either spouse is not required to file a federal income 1292
tax return and either or both are required to file a return 1293
pursuant to this chapter, they may elect to file separate or 1294
joint returns, and, pursuant to that election, their liabilities 1295
are separate or joint and several. If a husband and wife file 1296
separate returns pursuant to this chapter, each must claim the 1297

taxpayer's own exemption, but not both, as authorized under 1298
section 5747.02 of the Revised Code on the taxpayer's own 1299
return. 1300
(F) Each return or notice required to be filed under this 1301
section shall contain the signature of the taxpayer or the 1302
taxpayer's duly authorized agent and of the person who prepared 1303
the return for the taxpayer, and shall include the taxpayer's 1304
social security number. Each return shall be verified by a 1305
declaration under the penalties of perjury. The tax commissioner 1306
shall prescribe the form that the signature and declaration 1307
shall take. 1308
(G) Each return or notice required to be filed under this 1309
section shall be made and filed as required by section 5747.04 1310
of the Revised Code, on or before the fifteenth day of April of 1311
each year, on forms that the tax commissioner shall prescribe, 1312
together with remittance made payable to the treasurer of state 1313
in the combined amount of the state and all school district 1314
income taxes shown to be due on the form. 1315
Upon good cause shown, the commissioner may extend the 1316
period for filing any notice or return required to be filed 1317
under this section and may adopt rules relating to extensions. 1318
If the extension results in an extension of time for the payment 1319
of any state or school district income tax liability with 1320
respect to which the return is filed, the taxpayer shall pay at 1321
the time the tax liability is paid an amount of interest 1322
computed at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of 1323
the Revised Code on that liability from the time that payment is 1324
due without extension to the time of actual payment. Except as 1325
provided in section 5747.132 of the Revised Code, in addition to 1326
all other interest charges and penalties, all taxes imposed 1327

remaining unpaid after they become due, except combined amounts 1329
due of one dollar or less, bear interest at the rate per annum 1330
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code until paid or 1331
until the day an assessment is issued under section 5747.13 of 1332
the Revised Code, whichever occurs first. 1333
If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to 1334
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by section 5747.02 of the 1335
Revised Code or any tax imposed under Chapter 5748. of the 1336
Revised Code, the commissioner may require returns and payments 1337
to be made otherwise than as provided in this section. 1338
To the extent that any provision in this division 1339
conflicts with any provision in section 5747.026 of the Revised 1340
Code, the provision in that section prevails. 1341
(H) The amounts withheld pursuant to section 5747.06, 1342
5747.062, 5747.063, 5747.064, 5747.065, or 5747.071 of the 1343
Revised Code shall be allowed to the ultimate recipient of the 1344
income as credits against payment of the appropriate taxes 1345
imposed on the ultimate recipient by section 5747.02 and under 1346
Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code. As used in this division, 1347
"ultimate recipient" means the person who is required to report 1348
income from which amounts are withheld pursuant to section 1349
5747.06, 5747.062, 5747.063, 5747.064, 5747.065, or 5747.071 of 1350
the Revised Code on the annual return required to be filed under 1351
this section. 1352
(I) If a pass-through entity elects to file a single 1353
return under division (D) of this section and if any investor is 1354
required to file the annual return and make the payment of taxes 1355
required by this chapter on account of the investor's other 1356
income that is not included in a single return filed by a pass- 1357

through entity or any other investor elects to file the annual 1358
return, the investor is entitled to a refundable credit equal to 1359
the investor's proportionate share of the tax paid by the pass- 1360
through entity on behalf of the investor. The investor shall 1361
claim the credit for the investor's taxable year in which or 1362
with which ends the taxable year of the pass-through entity. 1363
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow any credit 1364
provided in this chapter to be claimed more than once. For the 1365
purpose of computing any interest, penalty, or interest penalty, 1366
the investor shall be deemed to have paid the refundable credit 1367
provided by this division on the day that the pass-through 1368
entity paid the estimated tax or the tax giving rise to the 1369
credit. 1370
(J) The tax commissioner shall ensure that each return 1371
required to be filed under this section includes a box that the 1372
taxpayer may check to authorize a paid tax preparer who prepared 1373
the return to communicate with the department of taxation about 1374
matters pertaining to the return. The return or instructions 1375
accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box 1376
the taxpayer authorizes the department of taxation to contact 1377
the preparer concerning questions that arise during the 1378
processing of the return and authorizes the preparer only to 1379
provide the department with information that is missing from the 1380
return, to contact the department for information about the 1381
processing of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund 1382
or payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical 1383
errors, offsets, or return preparation that the taxpayer has 1384
received from the department and has shown to the preparer. 1385
(K) The tax commissioner shall permit individual taxpayers 1386
to instruct the department of taxation to cause any refund of 1387
overpaid taxes to be deposited directly into a checking account, 1388

is the owner of an electing pass-through entity, as defined in 1396
section 5747.38 of the Revised Code, does not have Ohio adjusted 1397
gross income or, in the case of a trust, modified Ohio taxable 1398
income other than from one or more electing pass-through 1399
entities, the nonresident or trust shall not be required to file 1400
an annual return under this section. Nothing in this division 1401
precludes such an owner from filing the annual return under this 1402
section, utilizing the refundable credit under section 5747.39 1403
of the Revised Code equal to the owner's proportionate share of 1404
the tax levied under section 5747.38 of the Revised Code and 1405
paid by the electing pass-through entity, and making the payment 1406
of taxes imposed under section 5747.02 of the Revised Code. 1407

this section. 1409

claiming a credit under this section furnish information as is 1438

section, and no credit shall be allowed unless the requested 1440
information is provided. 1441
(C) The taxpayer shall claim the credit in the order 1442
required under section 5747.98 of the Revised Code. If the 1443
credit allowed for any taxable year exceeds the aggregate amount 1444
of tax otherwise due under section 5747.02 of the Revised Code, 1445
after allowing for any other credits preceding the credit in 1446
that order, the excess shall be refunded to the taxpayer in 1447
