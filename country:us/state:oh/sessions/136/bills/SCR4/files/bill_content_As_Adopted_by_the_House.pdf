As Adopted by the House
concerning these matters for members and employees of and 523
candidates for the General Assembly and for employees of any 524
legislative agency. 525

advisory opinion that has been publicly sought and that relates 527
to a special set of circumstances involving ethics, conflicts of 528
interest, or financial disclosure under Chapter 102. or section 529
2921.42 or 2921.43 of the Revised Code, the person to whom the 530

reasonably rely upon such opinion and shall be immune from 532
criminal prosecutions, civil suits, or actions for removal from 533
the person's office or position of employment for a violation of 534
Chapter 102. or section 2921.42 or 2921.43 of the Revised Code 535
based on facts and circumstances covered by the opinion, if the 536
opinion states that there is no violation of Chapter 102. or 537
section 2921.42 or 2921.43 of the Revised Code. The committee 538
shall include in every advisory opinion it renders a statement 539

2921.42 or 2921.43 of the Revised Code, the written opinion does 550
not have the legal effect of an advisory opinion issued under 551
division (B) of this section. When the Joint Legislative Ethics 552
Committee renders a written opinion that has been privately 553
sought, the written opinion is not a public record available 554
under section 149.43 of the Revised Code. 555

As Adopted by the House
The person to whom a written opinion is issued under this 556
division may request the committee to issue the written opinion 557
as an advisory opinion. The person may make the request at any 558
time within thirty days after the written opinion is issued and 559
prior to committing any proposed action discussed in the written 560
opinion. Upon receiving a timely request and with the approval 561
of a majority of the members of the committee, the committee may 562
issue the written opinion as an advisory opinion. If the 563
committee issues the written opinion as an advisory opinion, the 564
advisory opinion has the same legal effect as an advisory 565
opinion issued under division (B) of this section and is a 566
public record available under section 149.43 of the Revised 567
Code. If the person commits any proposed action discussed in the 568
written opinion before the committee issues the written opinion 569
as an advisory opinion, the advisory opinion grants no immunity 570
to the person regarding any action that is discussed in the 571
written opinion and that the person commits before the committee 572
issues the written opinion as an advisory opinion. 573
(D) The Joint Legislative Ethics Committee shall issue an 574

writing by the member or employee of or candidate for the 581
General Assembly or employee of any legislative agency who 582
desires the opinion and shall state in the request whether the 583
opinion is being publicly or privately sought. If the request 584
fails to state whether the opinion is being publicly or 585
privately sought, the committee shall consider the opinion to be 586
privately sought. The committee shall issue in writing all 587
advisory opinions that have been publicly sought, appropriately 588

number them, and make them available for public inspection. The 589

disposed of within six months after the complaint is filed, and 646
that, if a report dealing with the complaint has not been 647

face, constitute a breach of privilege, misconduct, a violation 679
of this Code of Ethics, or a violation of Chapter 102. or 680
sections 2921.42 or 2921.43 of the Revised Code, the committee 681
