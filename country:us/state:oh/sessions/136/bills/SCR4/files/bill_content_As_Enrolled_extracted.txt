Section 12. ADVISORY BODY
(A) The Joint Legislative Ethics Committee may recommend legislation relating to ethics,

publicly sought and that relates to a special set of circumstances involving ethics, conflicts of
interest, or financial disclosure under Chapter 102. or section 2921.42 or 2921.43 of the Revised
Code, the person to whom the opinion was directed or who was similarly situated may reasonably
rely upon such opinion and shall be immune from criminal prosecutions, civil suits, or actions for
removal from the person's office or position of employment for a violation of Chapter 102. or section

Section 19:
2921.42 or 2921.43 of the Revised Code based on facts and circumstances covered by the opinion, if
the opinion states that there is no violation of Chapter 102. or section 2921.42 or 2921.43 of the
Revised Code. The committee shall include in every advisory opinion it renders a statement as to
whether the set of circumstances described in the advisory opinion constitutes a violation of section

Section 20:
2921.42 or 2921.43 of the Revised Code. When the Joint Legislative Ethics Committee renders an
opinion that has been publicly sought, the advisory opinion is a public record available under section

Section 21:
149.43 of the Revised Code.
(C) When the Joint Legislative Ethics Committee renders a written opinion that has been
privately sought and that relates to a special set of circumstances involving ethics, conflicts of
interest, or financial disclosure under Chapter 102. or section 2921.42 or 2921.43 of the Revised
Code, the written opinion does not have the legal effect of an advisory opinion issued under division
(B) of this section. When the Joint Legislative Ethics Committee renders a written opinion that has
been privately sought, the written opinion is not a public record available under section 149.43 of the
Revised Code.
The person to whom a written opinion is issued under this division may request the
committee to issue the written opinion as an advisory opinion. The person may make the request at
any time within thirty days after the written opinion is issued and prior to committing any proposed
action discussed in the written opinion. Upon receiving a timely request and with the approval of a
majority of the members of the committee, the committee may issue the written opinion as an
S. C. R. No. 4 136th G.A.
10
advisory opinion. If the committee issues the written opinion as an advisory opinion, the advisory
opinion has the same legal effect as an advisory opinion issued under division (B) of this section and
is a public record available under section 149.43 of the Revised Code. If the person commits any
proposed action discussed in the written opinion before the committee issues the written opinion as
an advisory opinion, the advisory opinion grants no immunity to the person regarding any action that
is discussed in the written opinion and that the person commits before the committee issues the
written opinion as an advisory opinion.
(D) The Joint Legislative Ethics Committee shall issue an advisory opinion under division
(B) of this section or a written opinion under division (C) of this section, whether it is publicly or
privately sought, only at a meeting of the committee and only with the approval of a majority of the
members of the committee.
(E) All requests for an opinion shall be submitted in writing by the member or employee of or
candidate for the General Assembly or employee of any legislative agency who desires the opinion
and shall state in the request whether the opinion is being publicly or privately sought. If the request
fails to state whether the opinion is being publicly or privately sought, the committee shall consider
the opinion to be privately sought. The committee shall issue in writing all advisory opinions that
have been publicly sought, appropriately number them, and make them available for public
inspection. The Joint Legislative Ethics Committee shall conduct all of its proceedings surrounding
the rendering of an opinion so as to protect the confidentiality of those named in the request for the
opinion.

complaint if it is not disposed of within six months after the complaint is filed, and that, if a report
dealing with the complaint has not been published in the House or Senate Journal, as appropriate,
within that time, the complaint has been dismissed because no violation was found to have been
committed by the accused person. Within fourteen days after the filing of any complaint, the
chairperson shall deliver a copy of the complaint to the accused person and shall notify the accused
person that the accused person may file, within twenty days after receiving the copy, a written

Legislative Inspector General, the executive director, or the executive director's designee, shall

the facts and evidence gathered regarding the complaint. Upon receiving the preliminary findings, the

divisions (E) and (G) of this section, order remedial action pursuant to division (E) of this section, or

(A) The Joint Legislative Ethics Committee may recommend legislation relating to ethics,

(B) When the Joint Legislative Ethics Committee renders an advisory opinion that has been
publicly sought and that relates to a special set of circumstances involving ethics, conflicts of
interest, or financial disclosure under Chapter 102. or section 2921.42 or 2921.43 of the Revised
Code, the person to whom the opinion was directed or who was similarly situated may reasonably
rely upon such opinion and shall be immune from criminal prosecutions, civil suits, or actions for
removal from the person's office or position of employment for a violation of Chapter 102. or section
2921.42 or 2921.43 of the Revised Code based on facts and circumstances covered by the opinion, if
the opinion states that there is no violation of Chapter 102. or section 2921.42 or 2921.43 of the
Revised Code. The committee shall include in every advisory opinion it renders a statement as to
whether the set of circumstances described in the advisory opinion constitutes a violation of section
2921.42 or 2921.43 of the Revised Code. When the Joint Legislative Ethics Committee renders an
opinion that has been publicly sought, the advisory opinion is a public record available under section
149.43 of the Revised Code.

privately sought and that relates to a special set of circumstances involving ethics, conflicts of
interest, or financial disclosure under Chapter 102. or section 2921.42 or 2921.43 of the Revised

(B) of this section. When the Joint Legislative Ethics Committee renders a written opinion that has
been privately sought, the written opinion is not a public record available under section 149.43 of the
Revised Code.
The person to whom a written opinion is issued under this division may request the
committee to issue the written opinion as an advisory opinion. The person may make the request at
any time within thirty days after the written opinion is issued and prior to committing any proposed
action discussed in the written opinion. Upon receiving a timely request and with the approval of a
majority of the members of the committee, the committee may issue the written opinion as an

S. C. R. No. 4 136th G.A.
10
advisory opinion. If the committee issues the written opinion as an advisory opinion, the advisory
opinion has the same legal effect as an advisory opinion issued under division (B) of this section and
is a public record available under section 149.43 of the Revised Code. If the person commits any
proposed action discussed in the written opinion before the committee issues the written opinion as
an advisory opinion, the advisory opinion grants no immunity to the person regarding any action that
is discussed in the written opinion and that the person commits before the committee issues the
written opinion as an advisory opinion.
(D) The Joint Legislative Ethics Committee shall issue an advisory opinion under division
(B) of this section or a written opinion under division (C) of this section, whether it is publicly or
privately sought, only at a meeting of the committee and only with the approval of a majority of the
members of the committee.
(E) All requests for an opinion shall be submitted in writing by the member or employee of or
candidate for the General Assembly or employee of any legislative agency who desires the opinion
and shall state in the request whether the opinion is being publicly or privately sought. If the request
fails to state whether the opinion is being publicly or privately sought, the committee shall consider
the opinion to be privately sought. The committee shall issue in writing all advisory opinions that
have been publicly sought, appropriately number them, and make them available for public
inspection. The Joint Legislative Ethics Committee shall conduct all of its proceedings surrounding
the rendering of an opinion so as to protect the confidentiality of those named in the request for the
opinion.

has occurred. The complaint shall not contain innuendo, speculative assertions, or conclusory
statements.

complaint if it is not disposed of within six months after the complaint is filed, and that, if a report
dealing with the complaint has not been published in the House or Senate Journal, as appropriate,
within that time, the complaint has been dismissed because no violation was found to have been
committed by the accused person. Within fourteen days after the filing of any complaint, the
chairperson shall deliver a copy of the complaint to the accused person and shall notify the accused
person that the accused person may file, within twenty days after receiving the copy, a written

chairperson has delivered a copy of the complaint to the accused person, the chairperson shall
convene a meeting of the committee regarding the complaint. If at least eight members of the

2921.43 of the Revised Code, the committee shall dismiss the complaint.

initially by law enforcement or regulatory authorities.
