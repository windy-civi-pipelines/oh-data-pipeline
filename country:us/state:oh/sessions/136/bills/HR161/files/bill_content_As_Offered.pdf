Honoring the Village of Millersburg on its
Bicentennial.
WHEREAS, The members of the House of Representatives of the 136th 1
General Assembly of Ohio are pleased to recognize the Village of 2
Millersburg on the jubilant occasion of its Two Hundredth Anniversary; 3
and 4
WHEREAS, This is, indeed, an auspicious milestone, and celebration 5
is certainly in order. Since its inception two hundred years ago, the 6
Village of Millersburg has experienced dramatic growth and change, and 7
yet, commendably, even as its residents have exuberantly embraced the 8
promise of a bright future, they have never relinquished their 9
appreciation for the worthiest virtues of the past. Without 10
sacrificing their sense of tradition in the name of progress, the 11
people of Millersburg have managed to nurture a fresh perspective and 12
a positive outlook that endear this distinctive place to all who know 13
it well; and 14
WHEREAS, Two centuries after it was founded, the Village of 15
Millersburg still radiates vitality, optimism, and a charm all its 16
own. Clearly, it is a place of many engaging qualities, and its 17
schools, businesses, and civic organizations both embody and thrive 18
upon the values of which our flag is an emblem. A vigorous commitment 19
to public service and an earnest devotion to lofty ideals have long 20
been second nature to many of Millersburgâ€™s residents, and vigilance, 21
industriousness, and generosity have come to typify their collective 22
character; and 23
WHEREAS, Every state depends upon such vibrant, durable 24
communities as Millersburg for its own survival and stability. 25
Although it has known adversity and tribulation, the village also has 26

been favored with its share of blessings. In the years to come, 27
Millersburg is sure to remain on its admirable course and to continue 28
to transform challenges into opportunities; therefore be it 29
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the House of Representatives of 30
the 136th General Assembly of Ohio, in adopting this Resolution, 31
extend our congratulations to the Village of Millersburg on the 32
observance of its Bicentennial and offer our best wishes for its 33
perennial good fortune; and be it further 34
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives transmit 35
a duly authenticated copy of this Resolution to the Village of 36
Millersburg. 37
