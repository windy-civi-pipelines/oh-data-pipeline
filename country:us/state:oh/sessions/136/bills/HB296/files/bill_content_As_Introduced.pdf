(1) Restitution by the offender to the victim of the 20
offender's criminal offense or the victim's estate, in an amount 21
based on the victim's economic loss. In open court, the court 22
shall order that full restitution be made to the victim, to the 23
adult probation department that serves the county on behalf of 24
the victim, to the clerk of courts, or to another agency 25
designated by the court. At sentencing, the court shall 26
determine the amount of restitution to be made by the offender. 27
The victim, victim's representative, victim's attorney, if 28
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor's designee, and the 29
offender may provide information relevant to the determination 30
of the amount of restitution. The amount the court orders as 31
restitution shall not exceed the amount of the economic loss 32
suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the 33
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for 34
the cost of accounting or auditing done to determine the extent 35
of economic loss, the court may order restitution for any amount 36
of the victim's costs of accounting or auditing provided that 37
the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not exceed the 38
value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of 39
the offense. The court shall hold a hearing on restitution if 40
the offender, victim, victim's representative, or victim's 41
estate disputes the amount. The court shall determine the amount 42
of full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence. All 43
restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of 44
economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the 45
victim's estate against the offender. 46
The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge of 47
not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution 48
otherwise ordered to the entity responsible for collecting and 49
processing restitution payments. 50
