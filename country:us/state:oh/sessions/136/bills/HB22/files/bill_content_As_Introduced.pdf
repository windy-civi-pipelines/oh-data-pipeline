of this section. The reduction applies to only one homestead 204

(i) For a surviving spouse described in division (L)(1) of 219

H. B. No. 22 Page 9
As Introduced
section 323.151 of the Revised Code, the year the disabled 220
veteran dies; 221
(ii) For a surviving spouse described in division (L)(2) 222
of section 323.151 of the Revised Code, the first year on the 223
first day of January of which the total disability rating 224

(3) Real property taxes on a homestead owned and occupied, 229
or a homestead in a housing cooperative occupied, by the 230
surviving spouse of a public service officer killed in the line 231
of duty shall be reduced for each year for which an application 232
for the reduction has been approved. The reduction shall equal 233
the product obtained by multiplying fifty thousand dollars of 234
the true value of the property in money, as adjusted under 235
division (A)(1)(d) of this section, by the amounts described in 236
divisions (A)(1)(c)(ii) to (iv) of this section. The reduction 237
is in lieu of any reduction under section 323.158 of the Revised 238
Code or division (A)(1) or , (2), or (4) of this section. The 239

such a surviving spouse. A homestead qualifies for a reduction 241

in which the public service officer dies through the tax year in 243
which the surviving spouse dies or remarries. 244
(4) Real property taxes on a homestead owned and occupied, 245
or a homestead in a housing cooperative occupied, by a surviving 246
spouse of a qualifying service member killed in the line of duty 247
while serving in the uniformed services of the United States 248
shall be reduced for each year for which an application for the 249

H. B. No. 22 Page 10

reduction has been approved. The reduction shall equal all 250
current taxes charged and payable against the homestead for the 251
tax year. The reduction is in lieu of any reduction under 252
section 323.158 of the Revised Code or division (A)(1), (2), or 253
(3) of this section. The reduction applies to only one homestead 254
owned and occupied by such a surviving spouse. A homestead 255
qualifies for a reduction in taxes under division (A)(4) of this 256
section for the tax year in which the qualifying service member 257
dies through the tax year in which the surviving spouse dies, 258
remarries, or cohabitates with any individual domiciled in the 259
homestead that is not related by consanguinity to the surviving 260
spouse. 261
(B) To provide a partial exemption, real property taxes on 262
any homestead, and manufactured home taxes on any manufactured 263
or mobile home on which a manufactured home tax is assessed 264
pursuant to division (D)(2) of section 4503.06 of the Revised 265
Code, shall be reduced for each year for which an application 266
for the reduction has been approved. The amount of the reduction 267
shall equal two and one-half per cent of the amount of taxes to 268
be levied by qualifying levies on the homestead or the 269
manufactured or mobile home after applying section 319.301 of 270
the Revised Code. For the purposes of this division, "qualifying 271
levy" has the same meaning as in section 319.302 of the Revised 272
Code. 273
(C) The reductions granted by this section do not apply to 274
special assessments or respread of assessments levied against 275
the homestead, and if there is a transfer of ownership 276
subsequent to the filing of an application for a reduction in 277
taxes, such reductions are not forfeited for such year by virtue 278
of such transfer. 279

(D) The reductions in taxable value referred to in this 280
section shall be applied solely as a factor for the purpose of 281
computing the reduction of taxes under this section and shall 282
not affect the total value of property in any subdivision or 283
taxing district as listed and assessed for taxation on the tax 284
lists and duplicates, or any direct or indirect limitations on 285
indebtedness of a subdivision or taxing district. If after 286
application of sections 5705.31 and 5705.32 of the Revised Code, 287
including the allocation of all levies within the ten-mill 288
limitation to debt charges to the extent therein provided, there 289
would be insufficient funds for payment of debt charges not 290
provided for by levies in excess of the ten-mill limitation, the 291
reduction of taxes provided for in sections 323.151 to 323.159 292
of the Revised Code shall be proportionately adjusted to the 293
extent necessary to provide such funds from levies within the 294
ten-mill limitation. 295
(E) No reduction shall be made on the taxes due on the 296
homestead of any person convicted of violating division (D) or 297
(E) of section 323.153 of the Revised Code for a period of three 298
years following the conviction. 299

disability shall be accompanied by a certificate signed by a 327

totally disabled. The certificate shall be in a form that the 330
tax commissioner requires and shall include the definition of 331

affirming or verifying that the qualifying service member died 361
under such circumstances. 362
An application for a reduction under division (A) of 363
section 323.152 of the Revised Code constitutes a continuing 364
application for a reduction in taxes for each year in which the 365
dwelling is the applicant's homestead. 366

conveyance of real property pursuant to section 319.20 of the 375
Revised Code or of used manufactured homes or used mobile homes 376

(D)(4) of section 4503.06 of the Revised Code to be taxed under 379
division (D)(2) of that section for the ensuing year may file 380
the application at the time of making that election. The 381
application shall contain a statement that failure by the 382
applicant to affirm on the application that the dwelling on the 383
property conveyed is the applicant's homestead prohibits the 384
owner from receiving the reduction in taxes until a proper 385
application is filed within the period prescribed by division 386
(A)(3) of this section. Such an application constitutes a 387
continuing application for a reduction in taxes for each year in 388
which the dwelling is the applicant's homestead. 389
(3) Failure to receive a new application filed under 390
division (A)(1) or (2) or notification under division (C) of 391
this section after an application for reduction has been 392
approved is prima-facie evidence that the original applicant is 393
entitled to the reduction in taxes calculated on the basis of 394
the information contained in the original application. The 395
original application and any subsequent application, including 396
any late application, shall be in the form of a signed statement 397
and shall be filed on or before the thirty-first day of December 398
of the year for which the reduction is sought. The original 399
application and any subsequent application for a reduction in 400
manufactured home taxes shall be filed in the year preceding the 401

H. B. No. 22 Page 15
As Introduced
year for which the reduction is sought. The statement shall be 402
on a form, devised and supplied by the tax commissioner, which 403
shall require no more information than is necessary to establish 404
the applicant's eligibility for the reduction in taxes and the 405
amount of the reduction, and, except for homesteads that are 406
units in a housing cooperative, shall include an affirmation by 407
the applicant that ownership of the homestead was not acquired 408
from a person, other than the applicant's spouse, related to the 409
owner by consanguinity or affinity for the purpose of qualifying 410
for the real property or manufactured home tax reduction 411
provided for in division (A) or (B) of section 323.152 of the 412
Revised Code. The form shall contain a statement that conviction 413
of willfully falsifying information to obtain a reduction in 414
taxes or failing to comply with division (C) of this section 415
results in the revocation of the right to the reduction for a 416
period of three years. In the case of an application for a 417
reduction in taxes for persons described in division (A)(1)(b) 418
(iii) of section 323.152 of the Revised Code, the form shall 419
contain a statement that signing the application constitutes a 420
delegation of authority by the applicant to the tax commissioner 421
or the county auditor, individually or in consultation with each 422
other, to examine any tax or financial records relating to the 423
income of the applicant as stated on the application for the 424
purpose of determining eligibility for the exemption or a 425
possible violation of division (D) or (E) of this section. 426
(B) A late application for a tax reduction for the year 427
preceding the year in which an original application is filed, or 428
for a reduction in manufactured home taxes for the year in which 429
an original application is filed, may be filed with the original 430
application. If the county auditor determines the information 431
contained in the late application is correct, the auditor shall 432

refunded in the manner prescribed in section 5715.22 of the 439
Revised Code for making refunds of overpayments. The county 440

the property in the amount by which taxes were reduced under 467
that division for each tax year the county auditor ascertains 468
that the property was not entitled to the reduction and was 469
owned by the current owner or, in the case of a homestead in a 470
housing cooperative, occupied by the current occupant. Interest 471

Code on the amount by which taxes were reduced for each such tax 474

could be paid without penalty. The county auditor shall notify 477
the owner or occupant, by ordinary mail, of the charge, of the 478

than the last day prescribed for payment of real and public 483
utility property taxes under section 323.12 of the Revised Code 484

disability, and other information earlier furnished the auditor 496
relative to the reduction in taxes on the property. The 497
continuing application shall be returned to the auditor not 498
later than the thirty-first day of December; provided, that if 499
such changes do not affect the status of the homestead exemption 500
or the amount of the reduction to which the owner is entitled 501
under division (A) of section 323.152 of the Revised Code or to 502

manufactured or mobile home that transferred during the 509
preceding calendar year and that qualified for and received a 510

Revised Code for the preceding tax year. In order to receive the 512
reduction under that division, the owner shall file the 513
application with the county auditor not later than the thirty- 514
first day of December. If the application is not timely filed, 515
the auditor shall not grant a reduction in taxes for the 516

the reduction in taxes has not been granted, in the same manner 518
prescribed under section 323.154 of the Revised Code for 519
notification of denial of an application. Failure of an owner to 520
receive an application does not excuse the failure of the owner 521
to file an original application. The county auditor is not 522
required to furnish an application under this paragraph for any 523
homestead for which application has previously been made on a 524

psychologist licensed to practice in this state. The certificate 857
shall attest to the fact that the applicant is permanently and 858
totally disabled, shall be in a form that the department of 859
taxation requires, and shall include the definition of totally 860
and permanently disabled as set forth in section 4503.064 of the 861
Revised Code. An application for reduction in taxes based upon a 862
disability certified as permanent and total by a state or 863
federal agency having the function of so classifying persons 864
shall be accompanied by a certificate from that agency. 865
An application by a disabled veteran or the surviving 866
spouse of a disabled veteran for the reduction under division 867
(B)(1) or (2) of section 4503.065 of the Revised Code shall be 868
accompanied by a letter or other written confirmation from the 869
United States department of veterans affairs, or its predecessor 870
or successor agency, showing that the veteran qualifies as a 871
disabled veteran. 872
An application by the surviving spouse of a public service 873
officer killed in the line of duty for the reduction under 874
division (C) of section 4503.065 of the Revised Code shall be 875

H. B. No. 22 Page 31
As Introduced
accompanied by a letter or other written confirmation from an 876
officer or employee of the board of trustees of a retirement or 877
pension fund in this state or another state or from the chief or 878
other chief executive of the department, agency, or other 879
employer for which the public service officer served when killed 880
in the line of duty affirming that the public service officer 881
was killed in the line of duty. 882
An application for the reduction under division (D) of 883
section 4503.065 of the Revised Code by the surviving spouse of 884
a qualifying service member killed in the line of duty shall be 885
accompanied by a copy of United States department of defense 886
form DD-1300 report of casualty or other documentation from a 887
branch of the armed forces of the United States or the United 888
States department of veterans affairs or another federal agency 889
affirming or verifying that the qualifying service member died 890
under such circumstances. 891
(2) Each application shall constitute a continuing 892
application for a reduction in taxes for each year in which the 893
manufactured or mobile home is occupied by the applicant. 894
Failure to receive a new application or notification under 895
division (B) of this section after an application for reduction 896
has been approved is prima-facie evidence that the original 897
applicant is entitled to the reduction calculated on the basis 898
of the information contained in the original application. The 899
original application and any subsequent application shall be in 900
the form of a signed statement and shall be filed on or before 901
the thirty-first day of December of the year preceding the year 902
for which the reduction is sought. The statement shall be on a 903
form, devised and supplied by the tax commissioner, that shall 904
require no more information than is necessary to establish the 905
applicant's eligibility for the reduction in taxes and the 906

H. B. No. 22 Page 32
As Introduced
amount of the reduction to which the applicant is entitled. The 907
form shall contain a statement that signing such application 908
constitutes a delegation of authority by the applicant to the 909
tax commissioner or the county auditor, individually or in 910
consultation with each other, to examine any tax or financial 911
records that relate to the income of the applicant as stated on 912
the application for the purpose of determining eligibility 913
under, or possible violation of, division (C) or (D) of this 914
section. The form also shall contain a statement that conviction 915
of willfully falsifying information to obtain a reduction in 916
taxes or failing to comply with division (B) of this section 917
shall result in the revocation of the right to the reduction for 918
a period of three years. 919
(3) A late application for a reduction in taxes for the 920
year preceding the year for which an original application is 921
filed may be filed with an original application. If the auditor 922
determines that the information contained in the late 923
application is correct, the auditor shall determine both the 924
amount of the reduction in taxes to which the applicant would 925
have been entitled for the current tax year had the application 926
been timely filed and approved in the preceding year, and the 927
amount the taxes levied under section 4503.06 of the Revised 928
Code for the current year would have been reduced as a result of 929
the reduction. When an applicant is permanently and totally 930
disabled on the first day of January of the year in which the 931
applicant files a late application, the auditor, in making the 932
determination of the amounts of the reduction in taxes under 933
division (A)(3) of this section, is not required to determine 934
that the applicant was permanently and totally disabled on the 935
first day of January of the preceding year. 936
The amount of the reduction in taxes pursuant to a late 937

H. B. No. 22 Page 33
As Introduced
application shall be treated as an overpayment of taxes by the 938
applicant. The auditor shall credit the amount of the 939
overpayment against the amount of the taxes or penalties then 940
due from the applicant, and, at the next succeeding settlement, 941
the amount of the credit shall be deducted from the amount of 942
any taxes or penalties distributable to the county or any taxing 943
unit in the county that has received the benefit of the taxes or 944
penalties previously overpaid, in proportion to the benefits 945
previously received. If, after the credit has been made, there 946
remains a balance of the overpayment, or if there are no taxes 947
or penalties due from the applicant, the auditor shall refund 948
that balance to the applicant by a warrant drawn on the county 949
treasurer in favor of the applicant. The treasurer shall pay the 950
warrant from the general fund of the county. If there is 951
insufficient money in the general fund to make the payment, the 952
treasurer shall pay the warrant out of any undivided 953
manufactured or mobile home taxes subsequently received by the 954
treasurer for distribution to the county or taxing district in 955
the county that received the benefit of the overpaid taxes, in 956
proportion to the benefits previously received, and the amount 957
paid from the undivided funds shall be deducted from the money 958
otherwise distributable to the county or taxing district in the 959
county at the next or any succeeding distribution. At the next 960
or any succeeding distribution after making the refund, the 961
treasurer shall reimburse the general fund for any payment made 962
from that fund by deducting the amount of that payment from the 963
money distributable to the county or other taxing unit in the 964
county that has received the benefit of the taxes, in proportion 965
to the benefits previously received. On the second Monday in 966
September of each year, the county auditor shall certify the 967
total amount of the reductions in taxes made in the current year 968
under division (A)(3) of this section to the tax commissioner 969

H. B. No. 22 Page 34
As Introduced
who shall treat that amount as a reduction in taxes for the 970
current tax year and shall make reimbursement to the county of 971
that amount in the manner prescribed in section 4503.068 of the 972
Revised Code, from moneys appropriated for that purpose. 973
(B)(1) If in any year for which an application for 974
reduction in taxes has been approved the owner no longer 975
qualifies for the reduction, the owner shall notify the county 976
auditor that the owner is not qualified for a reduction in 977
taxes. 978
(2) If the county auditor or county treasurer discovers 979
that an owner not entitled to the reduction in manufactured home 980
taxes under section 4503.065 of the Revised Code failed to 981
notify the county auditor as required by division (B)(1) of this 982
section, a charge shall be imposed against the manufactured or 983
mobile home in the amount by which taxes were reduced under that 984
section for each tax year the county auditor ascertains that the 985
manufactured or mobile home was not entitled to the reduction 986
and was owned by the current owner. Interest shall accrue in the 987
manner prescribed by division (G)(2) of section 4503.06 of the 988
Revised Code on the amount by which taxes were reduced for each 989
such tax year as if the reduction became delinquent taxes at the 990
close of the last day the second installment of taxes for that 991
tax year could be paid without penalty. The county auditor shall 992
notify the owner, by ordinary mail, of the charge, of the 993
owner's right to appeal the charge, and of the manner in which 994
the owner may appeal. The owner may appeal the imposition of the 995
charge and interest by filing an appeal with the county board of 996
revision not later than the last day prescribed for payment of 997
manufactured home taxes under section 4503.06 of the Revised 998
Code following receipt of the notice and occurring at least 999
ninety days after receipt of the notice. The appeal shall be 1000

H. B. No. 22 Page 35
As Introduced
treated in the same manner as a complaint relating to the 1001
valuation or assessment of manufactured or mobile homes under 1002
section 5715.19 of the Revised Code. The charge and any interest 1003
shall be collected as other delinquent taxes. 1004
(3) During January of each year, the county auditor shall 1005
furnish each person whose application for reduction has been 1006
approved, by ordinary mail, a form on which to report any 1007
changes in total income, ownership, occupancy, disability, and 1008
other information earlier furnished the auditor relative to the 1009
application. The form shall be completed and returned to the 1010
auditor not later than the thirty-first day of December if the 1011
changes would affect the person's eligibility for the reduction. 1012
(C) No person shall knowingly make a false statement for 1013
the purpose of obtaining a reduction in taxes under section 1014
4503.065 of the Revised Code. 1015
(D) No person shall knowingly fail to notify the county 1016
auditor of any change required by division (B) of this section 1017
that has the effect of maintaining or securing a reduction in 1018
taxes under section 4503.065 of the Revised Code. 1019
(E) No person shall knowingly make a false statement or 1020
certification attesting to any person's physical or mental 1021
condition for purposes of qualifying such person for tax relief 1022
pursuant to sections 4503.064 to 4503.069 of the Revised Code. 1023
(F) Whoever violates division (C), (D), or (E) of this 1024
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. 1025
Section 2. That existing sections 323.151, 323.152, 1026
323.153, 4503.064, 4503.065, and 4503.066 of the Revised Code 1027
are hereby repealed. 1028
Section 3. The amendment by this act of sections 323.151, 1029

323.152, and 323.153 of the Revised Code applies to tax years 1030
ending on or after the effective date of this section. The 1031
amendment by this act of sections 4503.064, 4503.065, and 1032
4503.066 of the Revised Code applies to tax years beginning on 1033
or after the effective date of this section. 1034
Section 4. The General Assembly, applying the principle 1035
stated in division (B) of section 1.52 of the Revised Code that 1036
amendments are to be harmonized if reasonably capable of 1037
simultaneous operation, finds that the following sections, 1038
presented in this act as composites of the sections as amended 1039
by the acts indicated, are the resulting versions of the 1040
sections in effect prior to the effective date of the sections 1041
as presented in this act: 1042
