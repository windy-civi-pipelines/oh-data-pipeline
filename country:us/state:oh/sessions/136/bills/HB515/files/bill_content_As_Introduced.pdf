To amend sections 340.02 and 340.036 of the Revised 1
Code regarding the composition of boards of 2
alcohol, drug addiction, and mental health 3
services and regarding board contracts. 4
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF OHIO:
Section 1. That sections 340.02 and 340.036 of the Revised 5
Code be amended to read as follows: 6
Sec. 340.02. (A) For each alcohol, drug addiction, and 7
mental health service district, there shall be appointed a board 8
of alcohol, drug addiction, and mental health services. As 9
provided in this section, the board shall consist of eighteen 10
members, fifteen members, fourteen members, twelve members, or 11
nine members. 12
In a single-county district, the size of the board shall 13
be determined by the board of county commissioners representing 14
the county that constitutes the district. In a joint-county 15
district, the size of the board shall be determined jointly by 16
all of the boards of county commissioners representing the 17
counties that constitute the district. 18
The determination of board size shall be made by selecting 19
one of the options described in division (B) of this section. 20

As Introduced
After an option is selected and implemented, a subsequent 21
determination of board size may be made, except that subsequent 22
determinations shall not occur more frequently than once every 23
four calendar years. 24
If a selected option would result in a change in board 25
size, before the option may be implemented the board of county 26
commissioners or boards of county commissioners, as the case may 27
be, shall send a representative to a meeting of the board of 28
alcohol, drug addiction, and mental health services to solicit 29
feedback about the matter. After considering any feedback 30
received, the board or boards of county commissioners may 31
proceed with implementing the change in board size. If the 32
change results in a reduction of board members, the reduction 33
shall be implemented by not filling vacancies as they occur. 34
To implement a selected option that would result in the 35
establishment of a new board of alcohol, drug addiction, and 36
mental health services or in a change in size of an existing 37
board, the board or boards of county commissioners, as the case 38
may be, shall adopt a resolution specifying the board size that 39
has been selected. The board or boards of county commissioners 40
also shall notify the department of behavioral health of the 41
board size that has been selected. 42
(B)(1) In the case of a board of alcohol, drug addiction, 43
and mental health services that is established on or after 44
October 3, 2023, any of the following options may be selected 45
for purposes of division (A) of this section: 46
(a) To establish the board as an eighteen-member board; 47
(b) To establish the board as a fifteen-member board; 48
(c) To establish the board as a fourteen-member board; 49

purposes of division (A) of this section: 58
(a) To continue the board's operation as an eighteen- 59

members that is eighteen, fifteen, fourteen, twelve, or nine as 64
