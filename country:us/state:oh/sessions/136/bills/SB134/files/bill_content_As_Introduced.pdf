ordinance of a municipal corporation that has not contracted 1529

pay to the state public defender a percentage of the payment 1551
received from the person in an amount proportionate to the 1552
percentage of the costs of the person's case that were paid to 1553
the county by the state public defender pursuant to this 1554

certifies by electronic signature as prescribed by the state 1572
public defender that a financial disclosure form has been 1573
completed by the indigent person and is available for 1574

counsel in any case is not received by the state public defender 1576
within ninety days after the end of the calendar month in which 1577
the case is finally disposed of by the court, unless the county 1578
has requested and the state public defender has granted an 1579
extension of the ninety-day limit, the state public defender 1580
shall not pay the requested reimbursement. The state public 1581
defender shall also review the report and, in accordance with 1582

divisions (B)(7) and (8) of section 120.04 of the Revised Code 1584

(B)(1) Upon request by any person and subject to division 2276
(B)(8) of this section, all public records responsive to the 2277
request shall be promptly prepared and made available for 2278
inspection to the requester at all reasonable times during 2279
regular business hours. Subject to division (B)(8) of this 2280
section, upon request by any person, a public office or person 2281
responsible for public records shall make copies of the 2282
requested public record available to the requester at cost and 2283
within a reasonable period of time. 2284
When considering whether a state or local law enforcement 2285
agency promptly prepared a video record for inspection or 2286
provided a video record for production within a reasonable 2287
period of time, in addition to any other factors, a court shall 2288
consider the time required for a state or local law enforcement 2289
agency to retrieve, download, review, redact, seek legal advice 2290
regarding, and produce the video record. Notwithstanding any 2291
other requirement set forth in Chapter 149. of the Revised Code, 2292
a state or local law enforcement agency may charge a requester 2293
the actual cost associated with preparing a video record for 2294
inspection or production, not to exceed seventy-five dollars per 2295
hour of video produced, nor seven hundred fifty dollars total. 2296
As used in this division, "actual cost," with respect to video 2297
records only, means all costs incurred by the state or local law 2298
enforcement agency in reviewing, blurring or otherwise 2299

obscuring, redacting, uploading, or producing the video records, 2300
including but not limited to the storage medium on which the 2301
record is produced, staff time, and any other relevant overhead 2302
necessary to comply with the request. A state or local law 2303
enforcement agency may include in its public records policy the 2304
requirement that a requester pay the estimated actual cost 2305
before beginning the process of preparing a video record for 2306
inspection or production. Where a state or local law enforcement 2307
agency imposes such a requirement, its obligation to produce a 2308
video or make it available for inspection begins once the 2309
estimated actual cost is paid in full by the requester. A state 2310
or local law enforcement agency shall provide the requester with 2311
the estimated actual cost within five business days of receipt 2312
of the public records request. If the actual cost exceeds the 2313
estimated actual cost, a state or local law enforcement agency 2314
may charge a requester for the difference upon fulfilling a 2315
request for video records if the requester is notified in 2316
advance that the actual cost may be up to twenty per cent higher 2317
than the estimated actual cost. A state or local law enforcement 2318
agency shall not charge a requester a difference that exceeds 2319
twenty per cent of the estimated actual cost. 2320
If a public record contains information that is exempt 2321
from the duty to permit public inspection or to copy the public 2322
record, the public office or the person responsible for the 2323
public record shall make available all of the information within 2324
the public record that is not exempt. When making that public 2325
record available for public inspection or copying that public 2326
record, the public office or the person responsible for the 2327
public record shall notify the requester of any redaction or 2328
make the redaction plainly visible. A redaction shall be deemed 2329
a denial of a request to inspect or copy the redacted 2330

S. B. No. 134 Page 80
As Introduced
information, except if federal or state law authorizes or 2331
requires a public office to make the redaction. When the auditor 2332
of state receives a request to inspect or to make a copy of a 2333
record that was provided to the auditor of state for purposes of 2334
an audit, but the original public office has asserted to the 2335
auditor of state that the record is not a public record, the 2336
auditor of state may handle the requests by directing the 2337
requestor to the original public office that provided the record 2338
to the auditor of state. 2339
(2) To facilitate broader access to public records, a 2340
public office or the person responsible for public records shall 2341
organize and maintain public records in a manner that they can 2342
be made available for inspection or copying in accordance with 2343
division (B) of this section. A public office also shall have 2344
available a copy of its current records retention schedule at a 2345
location readily available to the public. If a requester makes 2346
an ambiguous or overly broad request or has difficulty in making 2347
a request for copies or inspection of public records under this 2348
section such that the public office or the person responsible 2349
for the requested public record cannot reasonably identify what 2350
public records are being requested, the public office or the 2351
person responsible for the requested public record may deny the 2352
request but shall provide the requester with an opportunity to 2353
revise the request by informing the requester of the manner in 2354
which records are maintained by the public office and accessed 2355
in the ordinary course of the public office's or person's 2356
duties. 2357
(3) If a request is ultimately denied, in part or in 2358
whole, the public office or the person responsible for the 2359
requested public record shall provide the requester with an 2360
explanation, including legal authority, setting forth why the 2361

S. B. No. 134 Page 81
As Introduced
request was denied. If the initial request was provided in 2362
writing, the explanation also shall be provided to the requester 2363
in writing. The explanation shall not preclude the public office 2364
or the person responsible for the requested public record from 2365
relying upon additional reasons or legal authority in defending 2366
an action commenced under division (C) of this section. 2367
(4) Unless specifically required or authorized by state or 2368
federal law or in accordance with division (B) of this section, 2369
no public office or person responsible for public records may 2370
limit or condition the availability of public records by 2371
requiring disclosure of the requester's identity or the intended 2372
use of the requested public record. Any requirement that the 2373
requester disclose the requester's identity or the intended use 2374
of the requested public record constitutes a denial of the 2375
request. 2376
(5) A public office or person responsible for public 2377
records may ask a requester to make the request in writing, may 2378
ask for the requester's identity, and may inquire about the 2379
intended use of the information requested, but may do so only 2380
after disclosing to the requester that a written request is not 2381
mandatory, that the requester may decline to reveal the 2382
requester's identity or the intended use, and when a written 2383
request or disclosure of the identity or intended use would 2384
benefit the requester by enhancing the ability of the public 2385
office or person responsible for public records to identify, 2386
locate, or deliver the public records sought by the requester. 2387
(6) If any person requests a copy of a public record in 2388
accordance with division (B) of this section, the public office 2389
or person responsible for the public record may require the 2390
requester to pay in advance the cost involved in providing the 2391

S. B. No. 134 Page 82
As Introduced
copy of the public record in accordance with the choice made by 2392
the requester under this division. The public office or the 2393
person responsible for the public record shall permit the 2394
requester to choose to have the public record duplicated upon 2395
paper, upon the same medium upon which the public office or 2396
person responsible for the public record keeps it, or upon any 2397
other medium upon which the public office or person responsible 2398
for the public record determines that it reasonably can be 2399
duplicated as an integral part of the normal operations of the 2400
public office or person responsible for the public record. When 2401
the requester makes a choice under this division, the public 2402
office or person responsible for the public record shall provide 2403
a copy of it in accordance with the choice made by the 2404
requester. Nothing in this section requires a public office or 2405
person responsible for the public record to allow the requester 2406
of a copy of the public record to make the copies of the public 2407
record. 2408
(7)(a) Upon a request made in accordance with division (B) 2409
of this section and subject to division (B)(6) of this section, 2410
a public office or person responsible for public records shall 2411
transmit a copy of a public record to any person by United 2412
States mail or by any other means of delivery or transmission 2413
within a reasonable period of time after receiving the request 2414
for the copy. The public office or person responsible for the 2415
public record may require the person making the request to pay 2416
in advance the cost of postage if the copy is transmitted by 2417
United States mail or the cost of delivery if the copy is 2418
transmitted other than by United States mail, and to pay in 2419
advance the costs incurred for other supplies used in the 2420
mailing, delivery, or transmission. 2421
(b) Any public office may adopt a policy and procedures 2422

that it will follow in transmitting, within a reasonable period 2423
of time after receiving a request, copies of public records by 2424
United States mail or by any other means of delivery or 2425
transmission pursuant to division (B)(7) of this section. A 2426
public office that adopts a policy and procedures under division 2427
(B)(7) of this section shall comply with them in performing its 2428
duties under that division. 2429
(c) In any policy and procedures adopted under division 2430
(B)(7) of this section: 2431
(i) A public office may limit the number of records 2432
requested by a person that the office will physically deliver by 2433
United States mail or by another delivery service to ten per 2434
month, unless the person certifies to the office in writing that 2435
the person does not intend to use or forward the requested 2436
records, or the information contained in them, for commercial 2437
purposes; 2438
(ii) A public office that chooses to provide some or all 2439
of its public records on a web site that is fully accessible to 2440
and searchable by members of the public at all times, other than 2441
during acts of God outside the public office's control or 2442
maintenance, and that charges no fee to search, access, 2443
download, or otherwise receive records provided on the web site, 2444
may limit to ten per month the number of records requested by a 2445
person that the office will deliver in a digital format, unless 2446
the requested records are not provided on the web site and 2447
unless the person certifies to the office in writing that the 2448
person does not intend to use or forward the requested records, 2449
or the information contained in them, for commercial purposes. 2450
(iii) For purposes of division (B)(7) of this section, 2451

inspect or to obtain a copy of any public record concerning a 2459
criminal investigation or prosecution or concerning what would 2460
be a criminal investigation or prosecution if the subject of the 2461
investigation or prosecution were an adult, unless the request 2462
to inspect or to obtain a copy of the record is for the purpose 2463
of acquiring information that is subject to release as a public 2464
record under this section and the judge who imposed the sentence 2465
or made the adjudication with respect to the person, or the 2466
judge's successor in office, finds that the information sought 2467
in the public record is necessary to support what appears to be 2468
a justiciable claim of the person. As used in this division, 2469
"public record concerning a criminal investigation or 2470
prosecution or concerning what would be a criminal investigation 2471
or prosecution if the subject of the investigation were an 2472
adult" includes, but is not limited to, personnel files and 2473
payroll and attendance records of designated public service 2474

journalist, a public office, or person responsible for public 2477

of this section. The mandamus action may be commenced in the 2549
court of common pleas of the county in which division (B) of 2550
this section allegedly was not complied with, in the supreme 2551
court pursuant to its original jurisdiction under Section 2 of 2552
Article IV, Ohio Constitution, or in the court of appeals for 2553
the appellate district in which division (B) of this section 2554
allegedly was not complied with pursuant to its original 2555
jurisdiction under Section 3 of Article IV, Ohio Constitution. 2556
(2) Upon filing a complaint or mandamus action with a 2557
court under divisions (C)(1)(a) or (b) of this section, a person 2558
allegedly aggrieved shall file with the court, in conjunction 2559
with the person's complaint or petition, a written affirmation 2560
stating that the person properly transmitted a complaint to the 2561
public office or person responsible for public records, the 2562
failure alleged in the complaint has not been cured or otherwise 2563
resolved to the person's satisfaction, and that the complaint 2564
was transmitted to the public office or person responsible for 2565
public records at least three business days before the filing of 2566
the suit. If the person fails to file an affirmation pursuant to 2567
this division, the suit shall be dismissed. 2568
(3) If a requester transmits a written request by hand 2569
delivery, electronic submission, or certified mail to inspect or 2570
receive copies of any public record in a manner that fairly 2571
describes the public record or class of public records to the 2572
public office or person responsible for the requested public 2573

records, except as otherwise provided in this section, the 2574
requester shall be entitled to recover the amount of statutory 2575
damages set forth in this division if a court determines that 2576
the public office or the person responsible for public records 2577
failed to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 2578
(B) of this section. Statutory damages are not available 2579
pursuant to this section to a person committed to the custody of 2580
the department of rehabilitation and correction or the United 2581
States bureau of prisons, or a child committed to the department 2582
of youth services as permitted in Chapter 2152. of the Revised 2583
Code. 2584
The amount of statutory damages shall be fixed at one 2585
hundred dollars for each business day during which the public 2586
office or person responsible for the requested public records 2587
failed to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 2588
(B) of this section, beginning with the day on which the 2589
requester files a mandamus action to recover statutory damages, 2590
up to a maximum of one thousand dollars. The award of statutory 2591
damages shall not be construed as a penalty, but as compensation 2592
for injury arising from lost use of the requested information. 2593
The existence of this injury shall be conclusively presumed. The 2594
award of statutory damages shall be in addition to all other 2595
remedies authorized by this section. 2596
The court may reduce an award of statutory damages or not 2597
award statutory damages if the court determines both of the 2598
following: 2599
(a) That, based on the ordinary application of statutory 2600
law and case law as it existed at the time of the conduct or 2601
threatened conduct of the public office or person responsible 2602
for the requested public records that allegedly constitutes a 2603

S. B. No. 134 Page 89
As Introduced
failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 2604
(B) of this section and that was the basis of the mandamus 2605
action, a well-informed public office or person responsible for 2606
the requested public records reasonably would believe that the 2607
conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or person 2608
responsible for the requested public records did not constitute 2609
a failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with 2610
division (B) of this section; 2611
(b) That a well-informed public office or person 2612
responsible for the requested public records reasonably would 2613
believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of the public 2614
office or person responsible for the requested public records 2615
would serve the public policy that underlies the authority that 2616
is asserted as permitting that conduct or threatened conduct. 2617
(4) In a mandamus action filed under division (C)(1) of 2618
this section, the following apply: 2619
(a)(i) If the court orders the public office or the person 2620
responsible for the public record to comply with division (B) of 2621
this section, the court shall determine and award to the relator 2622
all court costs, which shall be construed as remedial and not 2623
punitive. 2624
(ii) If the court makes a determination described in 2625
division (C)(4)(b)(iii) of this section, the court shall 2626
determine and award to the relator all court costs, which shall 2627
be construed as remedial and not punitive. 2628
(b) If the court renders a judgment that orders the public 2629
office or the person responsible for the public record to comply 2630
with division (B) of this section or if the court determines any 2631
of the following, the court may award reasonable attorney's fees 2632

S. B. No. 134 Page 90
As Introduced
to the relator, subject to division (C)(5) of this section: 2633
(i) The public office or the person responsible for the 2634
public records failed to respond affirmatively or negatively to 2635
the public records request in accordance with the time allowed 2636
under division (B) of this section. 2637
(ii) The public office or the person responsible for the 2638
public records promised to permit the relator to inspect or 2639
receive copies of the public records requested within a 2640
specified period of time but failed to fulfill that promise 2641
within that specified period of time. 2642
(iii) The public office or the person responsible for the 2643
public records acted in bad faith when the office or person 2644
voluntarily made the public records available to the relator for 2645
the first time after the relator commenced the mandamus action, 2646
but before the court issued any order concluding whether or not 2647
the public office or person was required to comply with division 2648
(B) of this section. No discovery may be conducted on the issue 2649
of the alleged bad faith of the public office or person 2650
responsible for the public records. This division shall not be 2651
construed as creating a presumption that the public office or 2652
the person responsible for the public records acted in bad faith 2653
when the office or person voluntarily made the public records 2654
available to the relator for the first time after the relator 2655
commenced the mandamus action, but before the court issued any 2656
order described in this division. 2657
(c) The court shall not award attorney's fees to the 2658
relator if the court determines both of the following: 2659
(i) That, based on the ordinary application of statutory 2660
law and case law as it existed at the time of the conduct or 2661

S. B. No. 134 Page 91
As Introduced
threatened conduct of the public office or person responsible 2662
for the requested public records that allegedly constitutes a 2663
failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 2664
(B) of this section and that was the basis of the mandamus 2665
action, a well-informed public office or person responsible for 2666
the requested public records reasonably would believe that the 2667
conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or person 2668
responsible for the requested public records did not constitute 2669
a failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with 2670
division (B) of this section; 2671
(ii) That a well-informed public office or person 2672
responsible for the requested public records reasonably would 2673
believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of the public 2674
office or person responsible for the requested public records 2675
would serve the public policy that underlies the authority that 2676
is asserted as permitting that conduct or threatened conduct. 2677
(5) All of the following apply to any award of reasonable 2678
attorney's fees awarded under division (C)(4)(b) of this 2679
section: 2680
(a) The fees shall be construed as remedial and not 2681
punitive. 2682
(b) The fees awarded shall not exceed the total of the 2683
reasonable attorney's fees incurred before the public record was 2684
made available to the relator and the fees described in division 2685
(C)(5)(c) of this section. 2686
(c) Reasonable attorney's fees shall include reasonable 2687
fees incurred to produce proof of the reasonableness and amount 2688
of the fees and to otherwise litigate entitlement to the fees. 2689
(d) The court may reduce the amount of fees awarded if the 2690

S. B. No. 134 Page 92
As Introduced
court determines that, given the factual circumstances involved 2691
with the specific public records request, an alternative means 2692
should have been pursued to more effectively and efficiently 2693
resolve the dispute that was subject to the mandamus action 2694
filed under division (C)(1) of this section. 2695
(6) If the court does not issue a writ of mandamus under 2696
division (C) of this section and the court determines at that 2697
time that the bringing of the mandamus action was frivolous 2698
conduct as defined in division (A) of section 2323.51 of the 2699
Revised Code, the court may award to the public office all court 2700
costs, expenses, and reasonable attorney's fees, as determined 2701
by the court. 2702
(D) Chapter 1347. of the Revised Code does not limit the 2703
provisions of this section. 2704
(E)(1) To ensure that all employees of public offices are 2705
appropriately educated about a public office's obligations under 2706
division (B) of this section, all elected officials or their 2707
appropriate designees shall attend training approved by the 2708
attorney general as provided in section 109.43 of the Revised 2709
Code. A future official may satisfy the requirements of this 2710
division by attending the training before taking office, 2711
provided that the future official may not send a designee in the 2712
future official's place. 2713
(2) All public offices shall adopt a public records policy 2714
in compliance with this section for responding to public records 2715
requests. In adopting a public records policy under this 2716
division, a public office may obtain guidance from the model 2717
public records policy developed and provided to the public 2718
office by the attorney general under section 109.43 of the 2719
Revised Code. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the 2720

public office will make available to a single person, may not 2722
limit the number of public records that it will make available 2723
during a fixed period of time, and may not establish a fixed 2724
period of time before it will respond to a request for 2725
inspection or copying of public records, unless that period is 2726
less than eight hours. 2727
The public office shall distribute the public records 2728
policy adopted by the public office under this division to the 2729
employee of the public office who is the records custodian or 2730
records manager or otherwise has custody of the records of that 2731
office. The public office shall require that employee to 2732
acknowledge receipt of the copy of the public records policy. 2733
The public office shall create a poster that describes its 2734
public records policy and shall post the poster in a conspicuous 2735
place in the public office and in all locations where the public 2736
office has branch offices. The public office may post its public 2737
records policy on the internet web site of the public office if 2738
the public office maintains an internet web site. A public 2739
office that has established a manual or handbook of its general 2740
policies and procedures for all employees of the public office 2741
shall include the public records policy of the public office in 2742
the manual or handbook. 2743

pursuant to Chapter 119. of the Revised Code to reasonably limit 2745
the number of bulk commercial special extraction requests made 2746
by a person for the same records or for updated records during a 2747
calendar year. The rules may include provisions for charges to 2748
be made for bulk commercial special extraction requests for the 2749
actual cost of the bureau, plus special extraction costs, plus 2750
ten per cent. The bureau may charge for expenses for redacting 2751

forward the copies for surveys, marketing, solicitation, or 2764
resale for commercial purposes. "Bulk commercial special 2765
extraction request" does not include a request by a person who 2766
gives assurance to the bureau that the person making the request 2767

the defendant, or agent of the defendant making a request under 2793
this division shall serve a copy of the request on the 2794
prosecuting attorney, director of law, or other chief legal 2795

(b) The recording has been used in connection with a 2804
criminal proceeding that was dismissed or for which a judgment 2805

complaint with the clerk of the court of claims pursuant to 2813
section 2743.75 of the Revised Code, requesting the court to 2814
order the release of all or portions of the recording. If the 2815
court considering the request determines that the filing 2816
articulates by clear and convincing evidence that the public 2817
interest in the recording substantially outweighs privacy 2818
interests and other interests asserted to deny release, the 2819
court shall order the public office to release the recording. 2820
Sec. 149.436. Notwithstanding division (A)(1)(gg) (A)(1) 2821

youthful dispositional sentence on a child when required under 3058
division (B)(3) of section 2152.121 of the Revised Code. In such 3059

(B) and (C) do not apply to the child, and the court shall 3061
impose the mandatory serious youthful dispositional sentence 3062
under division (D)(1) of this section. 3063
In all other cases, a juvenile court may impose a serious 3064
youthful offender dispositional sentence on a child only if the 3065
prosecuting attorney of the county in which the delinquent act 3066
allegedly occurred initiates the process against the child in 3067

following ways: 3071
(1) Obtaining an indictment of the child as a serious 3072
youthful offender; 3073
(2) The child waives the right to indictment, charging the 3074
child in a bill of information as a serious youthful offender; 3075
(3) Until an indictment or information is obtained, 3076

requesting a serious youthful offender dispositional sentence in 3077
the original complaint alleging that the child is a delinquent 3078
child; 3079
(4) Until an indictment or information is obtained, if the 3080
original complaint does not request a serious youthful offender 3081
dispositional sentence, filing with the juvenile court a written 3082
notice of intent to seek a serious youthful offender 3083
dispositional sentence within twenty days after the later of the 3084

regarding the complaint; 3088
(b) The date the juvenile court determines not to transfer 3089
the case under section 2152.12 of the Revised Code. 3090
After a written notice is filed under division (A)(4) of 3091
this section, the juvenile court shall serve a copy of the 3092
notice on the child and advise the child of the prosecuting 3093
attorney's intent to seek a serious youthful offender 3094
dispositional sentence in the case. 3095
(B) If an alleged delinquent child is not indicted or 3096
charged by information as described in division (A)(1) or (2) of 3097
this section and if a notice or complaint as described in 3098
division (A)(3) or (4) of this section indicates that the 3099
prosecuting attorney intends to pursue a serious youthful 3100
offender dispositional sentence in the case, the juvenile court 3101
shall hold a preliminary hearing to determine if there is 3102
probable cause that the child committed the act charged and is 3103
by age eligible for, or required to receive, a serious youthful 3104
offender dispositional sentence. 3105

(C)(1) A child for whom a serious youthful offender 3106
dispositional sentence is sought by a prosecuting attorney has 3107
the right to a grand jury determination of probable cause that 3108
the child committed the act charged and that the child is 3109
eligible by age for a serious youthful offender dispositional 3110
sentence. The grand jury may be impaneled by the court of common 3111
pleas or the juvenile court. 3112
Once a child is indicted, or charged by information or the 3113
juvenile court determines that the child is eligible for a 3114
serious youthful offender dispositional sentence, the child is 3115
entitled to an open and speedy trial by jury in juvenile court 3116
and to be provided with a transcript of the proceedings. The 3117
time within which the trial is to be held under Title XXIX of 3118

the date of the filing of the indictment or information. 3122

requests a serious youthful offender dispositional sentence, on 3124
the date of the filing of the complaint. 3125

that requests a serious youthful offender dispositional 3127
sentence, on the date that the prosecuting attorney files the 3128
written notice of intent to seek a serious youthful offender 3129
dispositional sentence. 3130
(2) If the child is detained awaiting adjudication, upon 3131
indictment or being charged by information, the child has the 3132
same right to bail as an adult charged with the offense the 3133
alleged delinquent act would be if committed by an adult. Except 3134

Code, all provisions of Title XXIX of the Revised Code and the 3136
Criminal Rules shall apply in the case and to the child. The 3137
juvenile court shall afford the child all rights afforded a 3138
person who is prosecuted for committing a crime including the 3139
right to counsel and the right to raise the issue of competency. 3140
The child may not waive the right to counsel. 3141
(D)(1) If a child is adjudicated a delinquent child for 3142
committing an act under circumstances that require the juvenile 3143
court to impose upon the child a serious youthful offender 3144
dispositional sentence under section 2152.11 of the Revised 3145
Code, all of the following apply: 3146
(a) The juvenile court shall impose upon the child a 3147

imposed. 3159

committing an act under circumstances that allow, but do not 3161
require, the juvenile court to impose on the child a serious 3162
youthful offender dispositional sentence under section 2152.11 3163

S. B. No. 134 Page 108

of the Revised Code, all of the following apply: 3164
(i) If the juvenile court on the record makes a finding 3165
that, given the nature and circumstances of the violation and 3166
the history of the child, the length of time, level of security, 3167
and types of programming and resources available in the juvenile 3168
system alone are not adequate to provide the juvenile court with 3169
a reasonable expectation that the purposes set forth in section 3170
2152.01 of the Revised Code will be met, the juvenile court may 3171
impose upon the child a sentence available for the violation, as 3172
if the child were an adult, under Chapter 2929. of the Revised 3173
Code, except that the juvenile court shall not impose on the 3174
child a sentence of death or life imprisonment without parole. 3175

action. 3277
(b) The person engaged in conduct that, if prosecuted, 3278
would constitute a felony, a misdemeanor that is an offense of 3279

claimed in the tort action, regardless of whether the person has 3283
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to or has been charged with 3284
committing the felony, the misdemeanor, or the attempt to commit 3285
the felony or misdemeanor. 3286
(c) The person suffered the injury or loss for which 3287

residence, regardless of whether the person has been convicted 3294
of or pleaded guilty to or has been charged with committing the 3295
felony, the misdemeanor, or the attempt to commit the felony or 3296
misdemeanor. Division (B)(2)(c) of this section does not apply 3297
if the person who suffered the injury or loss, at the time of 3298
the victim's act of self-defense, defense of another, or defense 3299
of residence, was an innocent bystander who had no connection 3300
with the underlying conduct that prompted the victim's exercise 3301
of self-defense, defense of another, or defense of residence. 3302
(3) Recovery against a victim of conduct that, if 3303
prosecuted, would constitute a felony, a misdemeanor that is an 3304
offense of violence, an attempt to commit a felony, or an 3305
attempt to commit a misdemeanor that is an offense of violence, 3306
on a claim for relief in a tort action is barred to any person 3307
or the person's legal representative if conduct the person 3308
engaged in against that victim was a proximate cause of the 3309
injury or loss for which relief is claimed in the tort action 3310
and that conduct, if prosecuted, would constitute a felony, a 3311
misdemeanor that is an offense of violence, an attempt to commit 3312

the felony or misdemeanor. 3317

this section, a person's act of self-defense, defense of 3323
another, or defense of the person's residence does not 3324
constitute intentionally tortious conduct. 3325

S. B. No. 134 Page 156
As Introduced
section 2907.05 of the Revised Code for which a presumption in 4564

presumed that a prison term is necessary in order to comply with 4566
the purposes and principles of sentencing under section 2929.11 4567
of the Revised Code. Division (D)(2) of this section does not 4568
apply to a presumption established under this division for a 4569
violation of division (A)(4) of section 2907.05 of the Revised 4570
Code. 4571

Chapter 2925., 3719., or 4729. of the Revised Code for which a 4580
presumption in favor of a prison term is specified as being 4581
applicable if it makes both of the following findings: 4582
(a) A community control sanction or a combination of 4583
community control sanctions would adequately punish the offender 4584
and protect the public from future crime, because the applicable 4585
factors under section 2929.12 of the Revised Code indicating a 4586
lesser likelihood of recidivism outweigh the applicable factors 4587
under that section indicating a greater likelihood of 4588
recidivism. 4589
(b) A community control sanction or a combination of 4590
community control sanctions would not demean the seriousness of 4591
the offense, because one or more factors under section 2929.12 4592
of the Revised Code that indicate that the offender's conduct 4593

S. B. No. 134 Page 157

was less serious than conduct normally constituting the offense 4594
are applicable, and they outweigh the applicable factors under 4595
that section that indicate that the offender's conduct was more 4596
serious than conduct normally constituting the offense. 4597
(E)(1) Except as provided in division (F) of this section, 4598
for any drug offense that is a violation of any provision of 4599
Chapter 2925. of the Revised Code and that is a felony of the 4600
third, fourth, or fifth degree, the applicability of a 4601
presumption under division (D) of this section in favor of a 4602
prison term or of division (B) or (C) of this section in 4603
determining whether to impose a prison term for the offense 4604
shall be determined as specified in section 2925.02, 2925.03, 4605
2925.04, 2925.05, 2925.06, 2925.11, 2925.13, 2925.22, 2925.23, 4606
2925.36, or 2925.37 of the Revised Code, whichever is applicable 4607
regarding the violation. 4608
(2) If an offender who was convicted of or pleaded guilty 4609
to a felony violates the conditions of a community control 4610
sanction imposed for the offense solely by reason of producing 4611
positive results on a drug test, the court, as punishment for 4612
the violation of the sanction, shall not order that the offender 4613
be imprisoned unless the court determines on the record either 4614
of the following: 4615
(a) The offender had been ordered as a sanction for the 4616
felony to participate in a drug treatment program, in a drug 4617
education program, or in narcotics anonymous or a similar 4618
program, and the offender continued to use illegal drugs after a 4619
reasonable period of participation in the program. 4620
(b) The imprisonment of the offender for the violation is 4621
consistent with the purposes and principles of sentencing set 4622
forth in section 2929.11 of the Revised Code. 4623

(3) A court that sentences an offender for a drug abuse 4624
offense that is a felony of the third, fourth, or fifth degree 4625
may require that the offender be assessed by a properly 4626
credentialed professional within a specified period of time. The 4627
court shall require the professional to file a written 4628
assessment of the offender with the court. If the offender is 4629
eligible for a community control sanction and after considering 4630
the written assessment, the court may impose a community control 4631
sanction that includes addiction services and recovery supports 4632
included in a community-based continuum of care established 4633
under section 340.032 of the Revised Code. If the court imposes 4634
addiction services and recovery supports as a community control 4635
sanction, the court shall direct the level and type of addiction 4636
services and recovery supports after considering the assessment 4637
and recommendation of community addiction services providers. 4638
(F) Notwithstanding divisions (A) to (E) of this section, 4639
the court shall impose a prison term or terms under sections 4640
section 2929.02 to 2929.06, section 2929.14, section 2929.142, 4641
or section 2971.03 of the Revised Code and except as 4642

term or terms pursuant to section 2929.20, division (A)(2) or 4646
(3) of section 2967.193 or 2967.194, or any other provision of 4647
Chapter 2967. or Chapter 5120. of the Revised Code for any of 4648
the following offenses: 4649
(1) Aggravated murder when death is not imposed or murder; 4650

regardless of the age of the victim, or an attempt to commit 4652
rape if, had the offender completed the rape that was attempted, 4653

court imposing sentence upon an offender for a felony finds that 5345
the offender is guilty of corrupt activity with the most serious 5346
offense in the pattern of corrupt activity being a felony of the 5347
first degree, or if the offender is guilty of an attempted 5348
violation of section 2907.02 of the Revised Code and, had the 5349
offender completed the violation of section 2907.02 of the 5350
Revised Code that was attempted, the offender would have been 5351
subject to a sentence of life imprisonment or life imprisonment 5352
without parole for the violation of section 2907.02 of the 5353
Revised Code, the court shall impose upon the offender for the 5354

division (A)(1)(a) of this section applies, the mandatory prison 5362

prison term of two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 5910

is convicted of or pleads guilty to a specification of the type 5913
described in section 2941.1424 of the Revised Code that charges 5914
that the offender is a violent career criminal and had a firearm 5915
on or about the offender's person or under the offender's 5916

the same act or transaction. 5928
(2) As used in division (K)(1) of this section, "violent 5929
career criminal" and "violent felony offense" have the same 5930
meanings as in section 2923.132 of the Revised Code. 5931

penalty for commission of the substantially equivalent offense 5953
under Amended Substitute House Bill 511 of the 109th General 5954
Assembly. If the offense for which sentence is being imposed 5955
does not have a substantial equivalent under that act, or if 5956
that act provides a more severe penalty than that originally 5957
prescribed for the offense of which the person is convicted, 5958
then sentence shall be imposed under the law as it existed prior 5959
to January 1, 1974. 5960
(C) Persons charged with an offense that is a felony of 5961
the third or fourth degree and that was committed on or after 5962

in advance of sentencing that they may choose to be sentenced 5969
pursuant to either the law in effect at the time of the 5970

sentencing. This notice shall be written and shall include the 5972
differences between and possible effects of the alternative 5973
sentence forms and the effect of the person's refusal to choose. 5974
The person to be sentenced shall then inform the court in 5975
writing of the person's choice, and shall be sentenced 5976

Sec. 2930.19. (A)(1) A victim, victim's representative, or 5997
victim's attorney, if applicable, or the prosecutor, on request 5998
of the victim, has standing as a matter of right to assert, or 5999
to challenge an order denying, the rights of the victim provided 6000
by law in any judicial or administrative proceeding. The trial 6001
court shall act promptly on a request to enforce, or on a 6002
challenge of an order denying, the rights of the victim. In any 6003
case, the trial court shall hear the matter within ten days of 6004

"NOTICE 6018
The victim, the victim's attorney, if applicable, or the 6019
prosecutor on request of the victim, may appeal this decision or 6020
petition to the court of appeals for an extraordinary writ. If 6021
such an interlocutory appeal or extraordinary writ is sought 6022
while the case is still pending in the trial court, it shall be 6023
initiated no later than fourteen days after notice of the 6024
decision was provided to the victim by telephone or electronic 6025
mail to the latest telephone number or electronic mail address 6026
provided by the victim. The prosecutor or the prosecutor's 6027
designee shall provide the notice to the victim and the notice 6028
shall be memorialized in a manner sufficient to prove to the 6029
court the prosecutor or prosecutor's designee sent the notice. 6030
The court shall dismiss any such interlocutory appeal or 6031
petition as untimely if it does not comply with this fourteen- 6032
day limit." 6033
(b)(i) If the court denies the relief sought, the victim 6034
or the victim's attorney, if applicable, or the prosecutor on 6035
request of the victim, may appeal or, if the victim has no 6036
remedy on appeal, petition the court of appeals or supreme court 6037
for an extraordinary writ, and the victim has standing to assert 6038
a right of limited appeal as it pertains to the decisions 6039
impacting the rights of the victim. An interlocutory appeal 6040

As Introduced
filed under this section shall be filed not later than fourteen 6041
days after notice was provided to the victim as described in 6042
division (A)(1) of this section, and such an appeal divests the 6043
trial court of jurisdiction of the portion of the case 6044
implicating the victim's rights until the interlocutory appeal 6045
is resolved by the appellate court. 6046
(ii) Upon the filing of an interlocutory appeal, the trial 6047
court shall transmit those portions of the transcript necessary 6048
for consideration of the issues to be reviewed by the court of 6049
appeals within five business days. Once the transcript is 6050
received by the court of appeals, the party that initiated the 6051
appeal shall have eight days to file a merit brief. Once the 6052
merit brief is filed, the appellee shall have eight days to file 6053
a response brief. The court of appeals shall decide the entire 6054
appeal not later than thirty-five days after the appeal is 6055
filed. Notwithstanding these limits, the litigants, with the 6056
approval of the court, may stipulate to a different period of 6057
time for the briefing and issuance of the decision and judgment 6058
on the appeal. The victim, the victim's attorney, the 6059
prosecutor, or the defendant may notify the supreme court if a 6060
court of appeals has failed to issue a judgment in accordance 6061
with the stipulated period of time. Such notifications are 6062
public records. 6063
(iii) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as 6064
applying to a direct appeal that is filed after the court 6065
sentences the defendant. A victim who wishes to appeal from an 6066
order that is final on its entry after the court sentences the 6067
defendant shall file the notice of appeal within thirty days of 6068
that entry. 6069
(c) If the victim or victim's attorney, if applicable, 6070

petitions for an extraordinary writ, the court of appeals or the 6071
supreme court shall enter an order establishing an expedited 6072
schedule for the filing of an answer, the submission of 6073
evidence, the filing of briefing by the litigants, and the entry 6074
of decision and judgment and shall place the petition on its 6075
accelerated calendar. The court of appeals or the supreme court 6076
shall immediately notify the trial court of the petition, and 6077
the trial court shall transmit to the court of appeals or the 6078
supreme court those portions of the transcript necessary for the 6079
consideration of the issues to be reviewed by the applicable 6080
appellate court within five business days of the filing of the 6081
appeal or petition. The court shall enter judgment within forty- 6082
five days after the petition for an extraordinary writ is filed. 6083
Notwithstanding these limits, the litigants, with the approval 6084
of the court, may stipulate to a different period of time for 6085
the briefing and issuance of the decision and judgment in the 6086
action. The victim, the victim's attorney, the prosecutor, or 6087
the defendant may notify the supreme court if a court of appeals 6088
has failed to issue a judgment in accordance with the stipulated 6089
period of time. Such notifications are a public record. 6090
(d) If any interlocutory appeal is pursued to the supreme 6091
court, the supreme court shall enter an order establishing an 6092
expedited schedule for its proceedings, including, as 6093
applicable, the filing of jurisdictional memoranda and ruling 6094
thereon, the transmission of the record, the filing of briefing 6095
by the litigants, oral argument if permitted, and the entry of 6096
decision and judgment and shall place the appeal on its 6097
accelerated calendar. The court shall enter judgment within 6098
sixty days after the appeal is filed. The supreme court shall 6099
immediately notify the trial court of the appeal, and the trial 6100
court shall transmit to the court of appeals or the supreme 6101

court those portions of the transcript necessary for 6102
consideration of the issues to be reviewed by the applicable 6103
appellate court within five business days of the filing of the 6104
appeal. Notwithstanding these limits, the litigants, with the 6105
approval of the court, may stipulate to a different period of 6106
time for the supreme court's proceedings and for the issuance of 6107
the supreme court's decision and judgment in the case. 6108
(e) Nothing in this division applies to a direct appeal 6109
that is filed by the victim after the court sentences the 6110
defendant. A victim who wishes to appeal from an appellate entry 6111
shall file the appropriate notice of appeal to the supreme court 6112
within thirty days of the entry. 6113
(B)(1) A victim of a criminal offense or delinquent act 6114
has the right to be represented by an attorney. Nothing in this 6115
section creates a right to an attorney at public expense for a 6116
victim. If a victim is represented by an attorney, the court 6117
shall notify the victim's attorney in the same manner in which 6118
the parties are notified under applicable law or rule. The 6119
victim's attorney shall be included in all bench conferences, 6120
meetings in chambers, and sidebars with the trial court that 6121
directly involve a decision implicating that victim's rights as 6122
enumerated in Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 10a. Nothing 6123
in this section shall be construed as making a victim a party to 6124
the case. 6125
(2) A defendant has a right to respond and be represented 6126
by an attorney for appeals and writs the victim, the victim's 6127
attorney, if applicable, or the prosecutor may file pursuant to 6128
this section. An indigent defendant has the right to appointed 6129
counsel for appeals and writs filed pursuant to this section. 6130
If, as an indigent person, a defendant is unable to employ 6131

S. B. No. 134 Page 208
As Introduced
counsel, the defendant is entitled to have counsel provided 6132
pursuant to Chapter 120. of the Revised Code. The court shall 6133
notify the defendant and the defendant's attorney in the same 6134
manner that the parties are notified under applicable law or 6135
rule. 6136
(C) The failure of a public official or public agency or 6137
the public official's or public agency's designee to comply with 6138
the requirements of this chapter does not give rise to a claim 6139
for damages against that public official or public agency or 6140
that public official's or public agency's designee, except that 6141
a public agency as an employer may be held responsible for a 6142
violation of section 2930.18 of the Revised Code. 6143
(D) The failure of any person or entity to provide a 6144
right, privilege, or notice to a victim under this chapter does 6145
not constitute grounds for declaring a mistrial or new trial, 6146
for setting aside a conviction, sentence, adjudication, or 6147
disposition, or for granting postconviction release to a 6148
defendant or alleged juvenile offender. 6149
(E) If there is a conflict between a provision in this 6150
chapter and a specific statute governing the procedure in a case 6151
involving a capital offense, the specific statute supersedes the 6152
provision in this chapter. 6153
(F) A defendant or juvenile offender may not raise the 6154
failure to afford a right to a victim as error in any legal 6155
argument to provide an advantage to that defendant or juvenile 6156
offender in any motion, including a dispositive motion, motion 6157
for a mistrial, motion for new trial, or motion to have a 6158
conviction, sentence, or disposition set aside, in any petition 6159
for post-conviction relief, or in any assignment of error on 6160
appeal. 6161

Sec. 2937.222. (A) On the motion of the prosecuting 6172
attorney or on the judge's own motion, the judge shall hold a 6173
hearing to determine whether an accused person charged with 6174
aggravated murder when it is not a capital offense, murder, a 6175
felony of the first or second degree, a violation of section 6176
2903.06 of the Revised Code, a violation of section 2903.211 of 6177
the Revised Code that is a felony, or a felony OVI offense shall 6178
be denied bail. The judge shall order that the accused be 6179
detained until the conclusion of the hearing. Except for good 6180
cause, a continuance on the motion of the state shall not exceed 6181
three court days. Except for good cause, a continuance on the 6182
motion of the accused shall not exceed five court days unless 6183
the motion of the accused waives in writing the five-day limit 6184
and states in writing a specific period for which the accused 6185
requests a continuance. A continuance granted upon a motion of 6186
the accused that waives in writing the five-day limit shall not 6187
exceed five court days after the period of continuance requested 6188
in the motion. 6189
At the hearing, the accused has the right to be 6190

counsel appointed. The judge shall afford the accused an 6192
opportunity to testify, to present witnesses and other 6193
information, and to cross-examine witnesses who appear at the 6194
hearing. The rules concerning admissibility of evidence in 6195
criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and 6196
consideration of information at the hearing. Regardless of 6197
whether the hearing is being held on the motion of the 6198
prosecuting attorney or on the court's own motion, the state has 6199
the burden of proving that the proof is evident or the 6200
presumption great that the accused committed the offense with 6201
which the accused is charged, of proving that the accused poses 6202
a substantial risk of serious physical harm to any person or to 6203
the community, and of proving that no release conditions will 6204
reasonably assure the safety of that person and the community. 6205
The judge may reopen the hearing at any time before trial 6206
if the judge finds that information exists that was not known to 6207
the movant at the time of the hearing and that that information 6208
has a material bearing on whether bail should be denied. If a 6209
municipal court or county court enters an order denying bail, a 6210
judge of the court of common pleas having jurisdiction over the 6211
case may continue that order or may hold a hearing pursuant to 6212
this section to determine whether to continue that order. 6213
(B) No accused person shall be denied bail pursuant to 6214
this section unless the judge finds by clear and convincing 6215
evidence that the proof is evident or the presumption great that 6216
the accused committed the offense described in division (A) of 6217
this section with which the accused is charged, finds by clear 6218
and convincing evidence that the accused poses a substantial 6219
risk of serious physical harm to any person or to the community, 6220

conditions will reasonably assure the safety of that person and 6222

(C) The judge, in determining whether the accused person 6224
described in division (A) of this section poses a substantial 6225
risk of serious physical harm to any person or to the community 6226
and whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably 6227
assure the safety of that person and the community, shall 6228
consider all available information regarding all of the 6229
following: 6230
(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense charged, 6231
including whether the offense is an offense of violence or 6232
involves alcohol or a drug of abuse; 6233

(3) The history and characteristics of the accused, 6235
including, but not limited to, both of the following: 6236
(a) The character, physical and mental condition, family 6237
ties, employment, financial resources, length of residence in 6238
the community, community ties, past conduct, history relating to 6239
drug or alcohol abuse, and criminal history of the accused; 6240
(b) Whether, at the time of the current alleged offense or 6241
at the time of the arrest of the accused, the accused was on 6242
probation, parole, post-release control, or other release 6243
pending trial, sentencing, appeal, or completion of sentence for 6244
the commission of an offense under the laws of this state, 6245
another state, or the United States or under a municipal 6246
ordinance. 6247
(4) The nature and seriousness of the danger to any person 6248
or the community that would be posed by the person's release. 6249

(b) Liberally modify or dispense with formal requirements 6255
in the interest of a speedy and just resolution of the appeal; 6256
(c) Decide the appeal expeditiously; 6257
(d) Promptly enter its judgment affirming or reversing the 6258
order denying bail. 6259
(2) The pendency of an appeal under this section does not 6260
deprive the court of common pleas of jurisdiction to conduct 6261
further proceedings in the case or to further consider the order 6262
denying bail in accordance with this section. If, during the 6263
pendency of an appeal under division (D) of this section, the 6264
court of common pleas sets aside or terminates the order denying 6265
bail, the court of appeals shall dismiss the appeal. 6266

to the state public defender for reimbursement. The request for 6489
reimbursement shall be accompanied by a financial disclosure 6490
form completed by each indigent person for whom counsel was 6491
provided on a form prescribed by the state public defender. The 6492
state public defender shall review the report and, in accordance 6493

120.35 of the Revised Code, if any, to the board. The amount of 6501
payments the state public defender is to make shall be 6502
determined as specified in section 120.34 of the Revised Code. 6503
(F) If any county system for paying appointed counsel 6504
fails to maintain the standards for the conduct of the system 6505
established by the rules of the Ohio public defender commission 6506
pursuant to divisions (B) and (C) of section 120.03 of the 6507
Revised Code or the standards established by the state public 6508
defender pursuant to division (B)(7) of section 120.04 of the 6509
Revised Code, the commission shall notify the board of county 6510
commissioners of the county that the county system for paying 6511
appointed counsel has failed to comply with its rules. Unless 6512
the board corrects the conduct of its appointed counsel system 6513
to comply with the rules within ninety days after the date of 6514
the notice, the state public defender may deny all or part of 6515

the defendant's right to trial by jury and elects to be tried by 6519
the court under section 2945.05 of the Revised Code, any judge 6520
of the court in which the cause is pending shall proceed to 6521
hear, try, and determine the cause in accordance with the rules 6522
and in like manner as if the cause were being tried before a 6523
jury. If the accused is charged with an offense punishable with 6524
death, he shall be tried by a court to be composed of three 6525
judges, consisting of the judge presiding at the time in the 6526
trial of criminal cases and two other judges to be designated by 6527
the presiding judge or chief justice of that court, and in case 6528
there is neither a presiding judge nor a chief justice, by the 6529
chief justice of the supreme court. The judges or a majority of 6530
them may decide all questions of fact and law arising upon the 6531
trial; however the accused shall not be found guilty or not 6532
guilty of any offense unless the judges unanimously find the 6533
accused guilty or not guilty. If the accused pleads guilty of 6534
aggravated murder, a court composed of three judges shall 6535
examine the witnesses, determine whether the accused is guilty 6536
of aggravated murder or any other offense, and pronounce 6537
sentence accordingly. The court shall follow the procedures 6538
contained in sections 2929.03 and 2929.04 of the Revised Code in 6539
all cases in which the accused is charged with an offense 6540
punishable by death. If in the composition of the court it is 6541
necessary that a judge from another county be assigned by the 6542
chief justice, the judge from another county shall be 6543
compensated for his services as provided by section 141.07 of 6544

counsel for the state expects to sustain it. 6551
(B) The defendant or the defendant's counsel must then 6552
state the defense, and may briefly state the evidence which the 6553
defendant or the defendant's counsel expects to offer in support 6554
of it. 6555
(C) The state must first produce its evidence and the 6556
defendant shall then produce the defendant's evidence. 6557
(D) The state will then be confined to rebutting evidence, 6558
but the court, for good reason, in furtherance of justice, may 6559
permit evidence to be offered by either side out of its order. 6560
(E) When the evidence is concluded, one of the following 6561
applies regarding jury instructions: 6562

court shall prepare written instructions to the jury on the 6564
points of law, shall provide copies of the written instructions 6565
to the jury before orally instructing the jury, and shall permit 6566
the jury to retain and consult the instructions during the 6567
court's presentation of the oral instructions and during the 6568
jury's deliberations. 6569
(2) In a case that is not a capital case, either party may 6570
request instructions to the jury on the points of law, which 6571

(G) The court, after the argument is concluded and before 6578
proceeding with other business, shall forthwith charge the jury. 6579
Such charge shall be reduced to writing by the court if either 6580

The court may deviate from the order of proceedings listed 6588
in this section. 6589
Sec. 2945.13. When two or more persons are jointly 6590
indicted for a felony, except a capital offense, they shall be 6591
tried jointly unless the court, for good cause shown on 6592
application therefor by the prosecuting attorney or one or more 6593
of said defendants, orders one or more of said defendants to be 6594
tried separately. 6595
Sec. 2945.21. (A)(1) In criminal cases in which there is 6596

the jurors in misdemeanor cases and, four of the jurors in 6599
felony cases other than capital cases that may subject the 6600
defendant to a sentence of life imprisonment, and six of the 6601

as if he the defendant were the sole defendant. 6605
(2) Notwithstanding Criminal Rule 24, in capital cases in 6606
which there is only one defendant, each party, in addition to 6607
the challenges for cause authorized by law, may peremptorily 6608
challenge twelve of the jurors. If there is more than one 6609
defendant, each defendant may peremptorily challenge the same 6610
number of jurors as if he were the sole defendant. 6611
(3) In any case in which there are multiple defendants, 6612
the prosecuting attorney may peremptorily challenge a number of 6613
jurors equal to the total number of peremptory challenges 6614
allowed to all of the defendants. 6615
(B) If any indictments, informations, or complaints are 6616
consolidated for trial, the consolidated cases shall be 6617
considered, for purposes of exercising peremptory challenges, as 6618
though the defendants or offenses had been joined in the same 6619
indictment, information, or complaint. 6620
(C) The exercise of peremptory challenges authorized by 6621
this section shall be in accordance with the procedures of 6622
Criminal Rule 24. 6623

found the indictment in the case; 6627
(B) That the person is possessed of a state of mind 6628
evincing enmity or bias toward the defendant or the state; but 6629
no person summoned as a juror shall be disqualified by reason of 6630
a previously formed or expressed opinion with reference to the 6631
guilt or innocence of the accused, if the court is satisfied, 6632
from examination of the juror or from other evidence, that the 6633

the evidence submitted to the jury at the trial; 6635
(C) In the trial of a capital offense, that the person 6636
unequivocally states that under no circumstances will the person 6637
follow the instructions of a trial judge and consider fairly the 6638
imposition of a sentence of death in a particular case. A 6639
prospective juror's conscientious or religious opposition to the 6640
death penalty in and of itself is not grounds for a challenge 6641
for cause. All parties shall be given wide latitude in voir dire 6642
questioning in this regard. 6643
(D) That the person is related by consanguinity or 6644
affinity within the fifth degree to the person alleged to be 6645

brought against the defendant for the same act; 6654

dependency; 6658
(I) (H) That the person has been convicted of a crime that 6659
by law disqualifies the person from serving on a jury; 6660
(J) (I) That the person has an action pending between the 6661

person and the state or the defendant; 6662
(K) (J) That the person or the person's spouse is a party 6663

the person; 6666

(O) (N) That the person otherwise is unsuitable for any 6678
other cause to serve as a juror. 6679
The validity of each challenge listed in this section 6680

Sec. 2945.33. When a cause is finally submitted the jurors 6682
must be kept together in a convenient place under the charge of 6683
an officer until they agree upon a verdict, or are discharged by 6684
the court. The court, except in cases where the offense charged 6685
may be punishable by death, may permit the jurors to separate 6686
during the adjournment of court overnight, under proper 6687
cautions, or under supervision of an officer. Such officer shall 6688
not permit a communication to be made to them, nor make any 6689
himself communication to them except to ask if they have agreed 6690

S. B. No. 134 Page 227
As Introduced
upon a verdict, unless he the officer does so by order of the 6691
court. Such officer shall not communicate to any person, before 6692
the verdict is delivered, any matter in relation to their 6693
deliberation. Upon the trial of any prosecution for misdemeanor, 6694
the court may permit the jury to separate during their 6695
deliberation, or upon adjournment of the court overnight. 6696
In cases where the offense charged may be punished by 6697
death, after the case is finally submitted to the jury, the 6698
jurors shall be kept in charge of the proper officer and proper 6699
arrangements for their care and maintenance shall be made as 6700
under section 2945.31 of the Revised Code. 6701
Sec. 2945.38. (A) If the issue of a defendant's competence 6702
to stand trial is raised and if the court, upon conducting the 6703
hearing provided for in section 2945.37 of the Revised Code, 6704
finds that the defendant is competent to stand trial, the 6705
defendant shall be proceeded against as provided by law. If the 6706
court finds the defendant competent to stand trial and the 6707
defendant is receiving psychotropic drugs or other medication, 6708
the court may authorize the continued administration of the 6709
drugs or medication or other appropriate treatment in order to 6710
maintain the defendant's competence to stand trial, unless the 6711
defendant's attending physician advises the court against 6712
continuation of the drugs, other medication, or treatment. 6713
(B)(1)(a)(i) If the defendant has been charged with a 6714
felony offense or a misdemeanor offense of violence for which 6715
the prosecutor has not recommended the procedures under division 6716
(B)(1)(a)(vi) of this section and if, after taking into 6717
consideration all relevant reports, information, and other 6718
evidence, the court finds that the defendant is incompetent to 6719
stand trial and that there is a substantial probability that the 6720

S. B. No. 134 Page 228
As Introduced
defendant will become competent to stand trial within one year 6721
if the defendant is provided with a course of treatment, the 6722
court shall order the defendant to undergo treatment. 6723
(ii) If the defendant has been charged with a felony 6724
offense and if, after taking into consideration all relevant 6725
reports, information, and other evidence, the court finds that 6726
the defendant is incompetent to stand trial, but the court is 6727
unable at that time to determine whether there is a substantial 6728
probability that the defendant will become competent to stand 6729
trial within one year if the defendant is provided with a course 6730
of treatment, the court shall order continuing evaluation and 6731
treatment of the defendant for a period not to exceed four 6732
months to determine whether there is a substantial probability 6733
that the defendant will become competent to stand trial within 6734
one year if the defendant is provided with a course of 6735
treatment. 6736
(iii) If the defendant has not been charged with a felony 6737
offense but has been charged with a misdemeanor offense of 6738
violence and if, after taking into consideration all relevant 6739
reports, information, and other evidence, the court finds that 6740
the defendant is incompetent to stand trial, but the court is 6741
unable at that time to determine whether there is a substantial 6742
probability that the defendant will become competent to stand 6743
trial within the time frame permitted under division (C)(1) of 6744
this section, the court may order continuing evaluation and 6745
treatment of the defendant for a period not to exceed the 6746
maximum period permitted under that division. 6747
(iv) If the defendant has not been charged with a felony 6748
offense or a misdemeanor offense of violence, but has been 6749
charged with a misdemeanor offense that is not a misdemeanor 6750

offense of violence and if, after taking into consideration all 6751
relevant reports, information, and other evidence, the court 6752
finds that the defendant is incompetent to stand trial, but the 6753
court is unable at that time to determine whether there is a 6754
substantial probability that the defendant will become competent 6755
to stand trial within the time frame permitted under division 6756
(C)(1) of this section, the court shall dismiss the charges and 6757
follow the process outlined in division (B)(1)(a)(v)(I) of this 6758
section. 6759
(v) If the defendant has not been charged with a felony 6760
offense or a misdemeanor offense of violence, or if the 6761
defendant has been charged with a misdemeanor offense of 6762
violence and the prosecutor has recommended the procedures under 6763
division (B)(1)(a)(vi) of this section, and if, after taking 6764
into consideration all relevant reports, information, and other 6765
evidence, the trial court finds that the defendant is 6766
incompetent to stand trial, the trial court shall do one of the 6767
following: 6768
(I) Dismiss the charges pending against the defendant. A 6769
dismissal under this division is not a bar to further 6770
prosecution based on the same conduct. Upon dismissal of the 6771
charges, the trial court shall discharge the defendant unless 6772
the court or prosecutor, after consideration of the requirements 6773
of section 5122.11 of the Revised Code, files an affidavit in 6774
probate court alleging that the defendant is a mentally ill 6775
person subject to court order or a person with an intellectual 6776
disability subject to institutionalization by court order. If an 6777
affidavit is filed in probate court, the trial court may detain 6778
the defendant for ten days pending a hearing in the probate 6779
court and shall send to the probate court copies of all written 6780
reports of the defendant's mental condition that were prepared 6781

S. B. No. 134 Page 230
As Introduced
pursuant to section 2945.371 of the Revised Code. The trial 6782
court or prosecutor shall specify in the appropriate space on 6783
the affidavit that the defendant is a person described in this 6784
subdivision. 6785
(II) Order the defendant to undergo outpatient competency 6786
restoration treatment at a facility operated or certified by the 6787
department of mental health and addiction services as being 6788
qualified to treat mental illness, at a public or community 6789
mental health facility, at a jail that employs or contracts with 6790
an individual or entity listed in division (B)(1)(b)(i) of this 6791
section to provide treatment or continuing evaluation and 6792
treatment at a jail, or in the care of a psychiatrist or other 6793
mental health professional. If a defendant who has been released 6794
on bail or recognizance refuses to comply with court-ordered 6795
outpatient treatment under this division, the court may dismiss 6796
the charges pending against the defendant and proceed under 6797
division (B)(1)(a)(v)(I) of this section or may amend the 6798
conditions of bail or recognizance and order the sheriff to take 6799
the defendant into custody and deliver the defendant to a center 6800
or facility operated or certified by the department of mental 6801
health and addiction services for treatment. 6802
(vi) If the defendant has not been charged with a felony 6803
offense but has been charged with a misdemeanor offense of 6804
violence and after taking into consideration all relevant 6805
reports, information, and other evidence, the court finds that 6806
the defendant is incompetent to stand trial, the prosecutor in 6807
the case may recommend that the court follow the procedures 6808
prescribed in division (B)(1)(a)(v) of this section. If the 6809
prosecutor does not make such a recommendation, the court shall 6810
follow the procedures in division (B)(1)(a)(i) of this section. 6811

S. B. No. 134 Page 231
As Introduced
(b)(i) The court order for the defendant to undergo 6812
treatment or continuing evaluation and treatment under division 6813
(B)(1)(a) of this section shall specify that the defendant, if 6814
determined to require mental health treatment or continuing 6815
evaluation and treatment, shall be committed to one of the 6816
following: 6817
(I) The department of mental health and addiction services 6818
for treatment or continuing evaluation and treatment at a 6819
hospital, facility, or agency, as determined to be clinically 6820
appropriate by the department; 6821
(II) A facility certified by the department of mental 6822
health and addiction services as being qualified to treat mental 6823
illness; 6824
(III) A public or community mental health facility; 6825
(IV) A jail that employs or contracts with an entity or 6826
individual listed in division (B)(1)(b)(i) of this section to 6827
provide treatment or continuing evaluation and treatment at a 6828
jail; 6829
(V) A psychiatrist or another mental health professional 6830
for treatment or continuing evaluation and treatment. 6831
(ii) Prior to placing the defendant, the department of 6832
mental health and addiction services shall obtain court approval 6833
for that placement following a hearing. The court order for the 6834
defendant to undergo treatment or continuing evaluation and 6835
treatment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall specify 6836
that the defendant, if determined to require treatment or 6837
continuing evaluation and treatment for an intellectual 6838
disability, shall receive treatment or continuing evaluation and 6839
treatment at an institution or facility operated by the 6840

S. B. No. 134 Page 232
As Introduced
department of developmental disabilities, at a facility 6841
certified by the department of developmental disabilities as 6842
being qualified to treat intellectual disabilities, at a public 6843
or private intellectual disabilities facility, or by a 6844
psychiatrist or another intellectual disabilities professional. 6845
In any case, the order may restrict the defendant's freedom of 6846
movement as the court considers necessary. The prosecutor in the 6847
defendant's case shall send to the chief clinical officer of the 6848
hospital, facility, or agency where the defendant is placed by 6849
the department of mental health and addiction services, or to 6850
the managing officer or director of the institution, facility, 6851
or jail, or the person to which the defendant is committed, 6852
copies of relevant police reports and other background 6853
information that pertains to the defendant and is available to 6854
the prosecutor unless the prosecutor determines that the release 6855
of any of the information in the police reports or any of the 6856
other background information to unauthorized persons would 6857
interfere with the effective prosecution of any person or would 6858
create a substantial risk of harm to any person. 6859
(iii) In determining the place of commitment, the court 6860
shall consider the extent to which the person is a danger to the 6861
person and to others, the need for security, the availability of 6862
housing and supportive services, including outpatient mental 6863
health services in the community, and the type of crime involved 6864
and shall order the least restrictive alternative available that 6865
is consistent with public safety and treatment goals. In 6866
weighing these factors, the court shall give preference to 6867
protecting public safety and the availability of housing and 6868
supportive services. 6869
(c) If the defendant is found incompetent to stand trial, 6870
if the chief clinical officer of the hospital, facility, or 6871

agency where the defendant is placed, or the managing officer or 6872
director of the institution, facility, or jail, or the person to 6873
which the defendant is committed for treatment or continuing 6874
evaluation and treatment under division (B)(1)(b) of this 6875
section determines that medication is necessary to restore the 6876
defendant's competency to stand trial, and if the defendant 6877
lacks the capacity to give informed consent or refuses 6878
medication, the chief clinical officer of the hospital, 6879
facility, or agency where the defendant is placed, or the 6880
managing officer or director of the institution, facility, or 6881
jail, or the person to which the defendant is committed for 6882
treatment or continuing evaluation and treatment may petition 6883
the court for authorization for the involuntary administration 6884
of medication. The court shall hold a hearing on the petition 6885
within five days of the filing of the petition if the petition 6886
was filed in a municipal court or a county court regarding an 6887
incompetent defendant charged with a misdemeanor or within ten 6888
days of the filing of the petition if the petition was filed in 6889
a court of common pleas regarding an incompetent defendant 6890
charged with a felony offense. Following the hearing, the court 6891
may authorize the involuntary administration of medication or 6892
may dismiss the petition. 6893
(2) If the court finds that the defendant is incompetent 6894
to stand trial and that, even if the defendant is provided with 6895
a course of treatment, there is not a substantial probability 6896
that the defendant will become competent to stand trial within 6897
one year, the court shall order the discharge of the defendant, 6898
unless upon motion of the prosecutor or on its own motion, the 6899
court either seeks to retain jurisdiction over the defendant 6900
pursuant to section 2945.39 of the Revised Code or files an 6901
affidavit in the probate court for the civil commitment of the 6902

affidavit is filed in the probate court, the trial court shall 6907
send to the probate court copies of all written reports of the 6908
defendant's mental condition that were prepared pursuant to 6909
section 2945.371 of the Revised Code. 6910
The trial court may issue the temporary order of detention 6911
that a probate court may issue under section 5122.11 or 5123.71 6912
of the Revised Code, to remain in effect until the probable 6913

on which the findings are based, and the examiner's opinion as 7005
to the defendant's capability of understanding the nature and 7006
objective of the proceedings against the defendant and of 7007
assisting in the defendant's defense. If, in the examiner's 7008
opinion, the defendant remains incapable of understanding the 7009
nature and objective of the proceedings against the defendant 7010
and of assisting in the defendant's defense and there is a 7011
substantial probability that the defendant will become capable 7012
of understanding the nature and objective of the proceedings 7013
against the defendant and of assisting in the defendant's 7014
defense if the defendant is provided with a course of treatment, 7015
if in the examiner's opinion the defendant continues to have a 7016
mental illness or an intellectual disability, and if the maximum 7017
time for treatment as specified in division (C) of this section 7018
has not expired, the report also shall contain the examiner's 7019
recommendation as to the least restrictive placement or 7020
commitment alternative that is consistent with the defendant's 7021

(H) If a defendant is committed pursuant to division (B) 7025
(1) of this section, within ten days after the treating 7026
physician of the defendant or the examiner of the defendant who 7027
is employed or retained by the treating facility advises that 7028
there is not a substantial probability that the defendant will 7029
become capable of understanding the nature and objective of the 7030
proceedings against the defendant or of assisting in the 7031
defendant's defense even if the defendant is provided with a 7032
course of treatment, within ten days after the expiration of the 7033
maximum time for treatment as specified in division (C) of this 7034
section, within ten days after the expiration of the maximum 7035
time for continuing evaluation and treatment as specified in 7036
division (B)(1)(a) of this section, within thirty days after a 7037
defendant's request for a hearing that is made after six months 7038
of treatment, or within thirty days after being advised by the 7039
treating physician or examiner that the defendant is competent 7040
to stand trial, whichever is the earliest, the court shall 7041
conduct another hearing to determine if the defendant is 7042
competent to stand trial and shall do whichever of the following 7043
is applicable: 7044
(1) If the court finds that the defendant is competent to 7045
stand trial, the defendant shall be proceeded against as 7046
provided by law. 7047
(2) If the court finds that the defendant is incompetent 7048
to stand trial, but that there is a substantial probability that 7049
the defendant will become competent to stand trial if the 7050
defendant is provided with a course of treatment, and the 7051

S. B. No. 134 Page 239

maximum time for treatment as specified in division (C) of this 7052
section has not expired, the court, after consideration of the 7053
examiner's recommendation, shall order that treatment be 7054
continued, may change the facility or location at which the 7055
treatment is to be continued, and shall specify whether the 7056
treatment is to be continued at the same or a different facility 7057
or location. 7058
(3) If the court finds that the defendant is incompetent 7059
to stand trial, if the defendant is charged with an offense 7060
listed in division (C)(1) of this section, and if the court 7061
finds that there is not a substantial probability that the 7062
defendant will become competent to stand trial even if the 7063
defendant is provided with a course of treatment, or if the 7064
maximum time for treatment relative to that offense as specified 7065
in division (C) of this section has expired, further proceedings 7066
shall be as provided in sections 2945.39, 2945.401, and 2945.402 7067
of the Revised Code. 7068
(4) If the court finds that the defendant is incompetent 7069
to stand trial, if the most serious offense with which the 7070
defendant is charged is a misdemeanor or a felony other than a 7071
felony listed in division (C)(1) of this section, and if the 7072
court finds that there is not a substantial probability that the 7073
defendant will become competent to stand trial even if the 7074
defendant is provided with a course of treatment, or if the 7075
maximum time for treatment relative to that offense as specified 7076
in division (C) of this section has expired, the court shall 7077
dismiss the indictment, information, or complaint against the 7078
defendant. A dismissal under this division is not a bar to 7079
further prosecution based on the same conduct. The court shall 7080
discharge the defendant unless the court or prosecutor files an 7081
affidavit in probate court for civil commitment pursuant to 7082

S. B. No. 134 Page 240

Chapter 5122. or 5123. of the Revised Code. If an affidavit for 7083
civil commitment is filed, the court may detain the defendant 7084
for ten days pending civil commitment and shall send to the 7085
probate court copies of all written reports of the defendant's 7086
mental condition prepared pursuant to section 2945.371 of the 7087
Revised Code. 7088
All of the following provisions apply to persons charged 7089

subject to division (A)(2)(b) of section 2953.09 of the Revised 7133
Code, execution of the sentence or judgment imposed for any 7134
fixed time that will give the person time either to prepare and 7135
file, or to apply for leave to file, the appeal. In all bailable 7136
cases, except as provided in division (B) of this section, the 7137
trial judge or magistrate may release the person on bail in 7138
accordance with section 2937.011 of the Revised Code, and the 7139

(C) If a trial judge of a court of common pleas is 7153
prohibited by division (B) of this section from releasing on 7154
bail pursuant to division (A) of this section a person who is 7155
convicted of a bailable offense and not sentenced to 7156
imprisonment for life, the appropriate court of appeals or two 7157
judges of it, upon motion of such a person and for good cause 7158
shown, may release the person on bail in accordance with section 7159
2937.011 of the Revised Code and Appellate Rule 8, and the bail 7160

Revised Code, the execution of the sentence or judgment imposed 7172
for a time sufficient to give such person an opportunity to file 7173
a notice of appeal to the supreme court, but the sentence or 7174
judgment imposed shall not be suspended more than thirty days 7175
for that purpose. 7176
Sec. 2953.02. In a capital case in which a sentence of 7177
death is imposed for an offense committed before January 1, 7178
1995, and in any other criminal case, including a conviction for 7179
the violation of an ordinance of a municipal corporation, the 7180
judgment or final order of a court of record inferior to the 7181
court of appeals may be reviewed in the court of appeals. A 7182
final order of an administrative officer or agency may be 7183
reviewed in the court of common pleas. A judgment or final order 7184
of the court of appeals involving a question arising under the 7185
Constitution of the United States or of this state may be 7186
appealed to the supreme court as a matter of right. This right 7187
of appeal from judgments and final orders of the court of 7188
appeals shall extend to cases in which a sentence of death is 7189
imposed for an offense committed before January 1, 1995, and in 7190

the supreme court has directed the court of appeals to certify 7192
its record, and in all other criminal cases of public or general 7193

or after January 1, 1995, the judgment or final order may be 7197
appealed from the trial court directly to the supreme court as a 7198
matter of right. The supreme court in criminal cases shall not 7199
be required to determine as to the weight of the evidence, 7200
except that, in cases in which a sentence of death is imposed 7201
for an offense committed on or after January 1, 1995, and in 7202

S. B. No. 134 Page 244
As Introduced
which the question of the weight of the evidence to support the 7203
judgment has been raised on appeal, the supreme court shall 7204

an appeal from a mayor's court, the appellate court may affirm 7210
the judgment or reverse it, in whole or in part, or modify it, 7211
and order the accused to be discharged or grant a new trial. The 7212
appellate court may remand the accused for the sole purpose of 7213
correcting a sentence imposed contrary to law, provided that, on 7214
an appeal of a sentence imposed upon a person who is convicted 7215
of or pleads guilty to a felony that is brought under section 7216
2953.08 of the Revised Code, division (G) of that section 7217
applies to the court. If the judgment is reversed, the appellant 7218
shall recover from the appellee all court costs incurred to 7219
secure the reversal, including the cost of transcripts. In 7220
capital cases, when the judgment is affirmed and the day fixed 7221
for the execution is passed, the appellate court shall appoint a 7222
day for it, and the clerk of the appellate court shall issue a 7223
warrant under the seal of the appellate court, to the sheriff of 7224
the proper county, or the warden of the appropriate state 7225
correctional institution, commanding the sheriff or warden to 7226
carry the sentence into execution on the day so appointed. The 7227
sheriff or warden shall execute and return the warrant as in 7228
other cases, and the clerk shall record the warrant and return. 7229
(B) As used in this section, "appellate court" means, for 7230
a case in which a sentence of death is imposed for an offense 7231
committed before January 1, 1995, both the court of appeals and 7232
the supreme court, and for a case in which a sentence of death 7233

is imposed for an offense committed on or after January 1, 1995, 7234
the supreme court. 7235
Sec. 2953.08. (A) In addition to any other right to appeal 7236
and except as provided in division (D) of this section, a 7237
defendant who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a felony may 7238
appeal as a matter of right the sentence imposed upon the 7239
defendant on one of the following grounds: 7240
(1) The sentence consisted of or included the maximum 7241
definite prison term allowed for the offense by division (A) of 7242
section 2929.14 or section 2929.142 of the Revised Code or, with 7243
respect to a non-life felony indefinite prison term, the longest 7244
minimum prison term allowed for the offense by division (A)(1) 7245
(a) or (2)(a) of section 2929.14 of the Revised Code, the 7246
maximum definite prison term or longest minimum prison term was 7247
not required for the offense pursuant to Chapter 2925. or any 7248
other provision of the Revised Code, and the court imposed the 7249
sentence under one of the following circumstances: 7250
(a) The sentence was imposed for only one offense. 7251
(b) The sentence was imposed for two or more offenses 7252
arising out of a single incident, and the court imposed the 7253
maximum definite prison term or longest minimum prison term for 7254
the offense of the highest degree. 7255
(2) The sentence consisted of or included a prison term 7256
and the offense for which it was imposed is a felony of the 7257
fourth or fifth degree or is a felony drug offense that is a 7258
violation of a provision of Chapter 2925. of the Revised Code 7259
and that is specified as being subject to division (B) of 7260
section 2929.13 of the Revised Code for purposes of sentencing. 7261
If the court specifies that it found one or more of the factors 7262

S. B. No. 134 Page 246

in division (B)(1)(b) of section 2929.13 of the Revised Code to 7263
apply relative to the defendant, the defendant is not entitled 7264
under this division to appeal as a matter of right the sentence 7265
imposed upon the offender. 7266
(3) The person was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a 7267
violent sex offense or a designated homicide, assault, or 7268
kidnapping offense, was adjudicated a sexually violent predator 7269
in relation to that offense, and was sentenced pursuant to 7270
division (A)(3) of section 2971.03 of the Revised Code, if the 7271
minimum term of the indefinite term imposed pursuant to division 7272
(A)(3) of section 2971.03 of the Revised Code is the longest 7273
term available for the offense from among the range of definite 7274
terms listed in section 2929.14 of the Revised Code or, with 7275
respect to a non-life felony indefinite prison term, the longest 7276
minimum prison term allowed for the offense by division (A)(1) 7277
(a) or (2)(a) of section 2929.14 of the Revised Code. As used in 7278
this division, "designated homicide, assault, or kidnapping 7279
offense" and "violent sex offense" have the same meanings as in 7280
section 2971.01 of the Revised Code. As used in this division, 7281
"adjudicated a sexually violent predator" has the same meaning 7282
as in section 2929.01 of the Revised Code, and a person is 7283
"adjudicated a sexually violent predator" in the same manner and 7284
the same circumstances as are described in that section. 7285

as a matter of right a sentence imposed upon a defendant who is 7295
convicted of or pleads guilty to a felony or, in the 7296
circumstances described in division (B)(3) of this section the 7297
modification of a sentence imposed upon such a defendant, on any 7298
of the following grounds: 7299
(1) The sentence did not include a prison term despite a 7300
presumption favoring a prison term for the offense for which it 7301
was imposed, as set forth in section 2929.13 or Chapter 2925. of 7302
the Revised Code. 7303
(2) The sentence is contrary to law. 7304
(3) The sentence is a modification under section 2929.20 7305
of the Revised Code of a sentence that was imposed for a felony 7306
of the first or second degree. 7307
(C)(1) In addition to the right to appeal a sentence 7308
granted under division (A) or (B) of this section, a defendant 7309
who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a felony may seek leave 7310
to appeal a sentence imposed upon the defendant on the basis 7311
that the sentencing judge has imposed consecutive sentences 7312
under division (C)(3) of section 2929.14 of the Revised Code and 7313
that the consecutive sentences exceed the maximum definite 7314
prison term allowed by division (A) of that section for the most 7315
serious offense of which the defendant was convicted or, with 7316
respect to a non-life felony indefinite prison term, exceed the 7317
longest minimum prison term allowed by division (A)(1)(a) or (2) 7318
(a) of that section for the most serious such offense. Upon the 7319
filing of a motion under this division, the court of appeals may 7320
grant leave to appeal the sentence if the court determines that 7321
the allegation included as the basis of the motion is true. 7322

S. B. No. 134 Page 248

(2) A defendant may seek leave to appeal an additional 7323
sentence imposed upon the defendant pursuant to division (B)(2) 7324
(a) or (b) of section 2929.14 of the Revised Code if the 7325
additional sentence is for a definite prison term that is longer 7326
than five years. 7327
(D)(1) A sentence imposed upon a defendant is not subject 7328
to review under this section if the sentence is authorized by 7329
law, has been recommended jointly by the defendant and the 7330
prosecution in the case, and is imposed by a sentencing judge. 7331
(2) Except as provided in division (C)(2) of this section, 7332
a sentence imposed upon a defendant is not subject to review 7333
under this section if the sentence is imposed pursuant to 7334
division (B)(2)(b) of section 2929.14 of the Revised Code. 7335
Except as otherwise provided in this division, a defendant 7336
retains all rights to appeal as provided under this chapter or 7337
any other provision of the Revised Code. A defendant has the 7338
right to appeal under this chapter or any other provision of the 7339
Revised Code the court's application of division (B)(2)(c) of 7340
section 2929.14 of the Revised Code. 7341

Rules of Appellate Procedure, provided that if the appeal is 7349

(F) On the appeal of a sentence under this section, the 7357
record to be reviewed shall include all of the following, as 7358
applicable: 7359

2947.06 or 2951.03 of the Revised Code or Criminal Rule 32.2 in 7364
connection with the appeal of a sentence under this section 7365
shall comply with division (D)(3) of section 2951.03 of the 7366
Revised Code when the appellate court is not using the 7367
presentence investigation report, and the appellate court's use 7368
of a presentence investigation report of that nature in 7369
connection with the appeal of a sentence under this section does 7370
not affect the otherwise confidential character of the contents 7371
of that report as described in division (D)(1) of section 7372
2951.03 of the Revised Code and does not cause that report to 7373
become a public record, as defined in section 149.43 of the 7374
Revised Code, following the appellate court's use of the report. 7375
(2) The trial record in the case in which the sentence was 7376
imposed; 7377
(3) Any oral or written statements made to or by the court 7378
at the sentencing hearing at which the sentence was imposed; 7379

record, the court hearing an appeal under division (A), (B), or 7391
(C) of this section shall remand the case to the sentencing 7392
court and instruct the sentencing court to state, on the record, 7393
the required findings. 7394

modify a sentence that is appealed under this section or may 7400
vacate the sentence and remand the matter to the sentencing 7401
court for resentencing. The appellate court's standard for 7402
review is not whether the sentencing court abused its 7403
discretion. The appellate court may take any action authorized 7404
by this division if it clearly and convincingly finds either of 7405
the following: 7406
(a) That the record does not support the sentencing 7407
court's findings under division (B) or (D) of section 2929.13, 7408
division (B)(2)(e) or (C)(4) of section 2929.14, or division (I) 7409
of section 2929.20 of the Revised Code, whichever, if any, is 7410
relevant; 7411

(b) That the sentence is otherwise contrary to law. 7412
(H) A judgment or final order of a court of appeals under 7413
this section may be appealed, by leave of court, to the supreme 7414
court. 7415
(I) As used in this section, "non-life felony indefinite 7416
prison term" has the same meaning as in section 2929.01 of the 7417
Revised Code. 7418
Sec. 2953.09. (A)(1) Upon filing an appeal in the supreme 7419
court, the execution of the sentence or judgment imposed in 7420
cases of felony is suspended. 7421
(2)(a)(2) If a notice of appeal is filed pursuant to the 7422
Rules of Appellate Procedure by a defendant who is convicted in 7423
a municipal or county court or a court of common pleas of a 7424
felony or misdemeanor under the Revised Code or an ordinance of 7425
a municipal corporation, the filing of the notice of appeal does 7426
not suspend execution of the sentence or judgment imposed. 7427
However, consistent with divisions (A)(2)(b), (B), and (C) of 7428
this section, section 2937.011 of the Revised Code, and 7429
Appellate Rule 8, the municipal or county court, court of common 7430
pleas, or court of appeals may suspend execution of the sentence 7431
or judgment imposed during the pendency of the appeal and shall 7432
determine whether that defendant is entitled to bail and the 7433
amount and nature of any bail that is required. The bail shall 7434
at least be conditioned that the defendant will prosecute the 7435
appeal without delay and abide by the judgment and sentence of 7436
the court. 7437
(b)(i) A court of common pleas or court of appeals may 7438
suspend the execution of a sentence of death imposed for an 7439
offense committed before January 1, 1995, only if no date for 7440

S. B. No. 134 Page 252

execution has been set by the supreme court, good cause is shown 7441
for the suspension, the defendant files a motion requesting the 7442
suspension, and notice has been given to the prosecuting 7443
attorney of the appropriate county. 7444
(ii) A court of common pleas may suspend the execution of 7445
a sentence of death imposed for an offense committed on or after 7446
January 1, 1995, only if no date for execution has been set by 7447
the supreme court, good cause is shown, the defendant files a 7448
motion requesting the suspension, and notice has been given to 7449
the prosecuting attorney of the appropriate county. 7450
(iii) A court of common pleas or court of appeals may 7451
suspend the execution of the sentence or judgment imposed for a 7452
felony in a capital case in which a sentence of death is not 7453
imposed only if no date for execution of the sentence has been 7454
set by the supreme court, good cause is shown for the 7455
suspension, the defendant files a motion requesting the 7456
suspension, and only after notice has been given to the 7457
prosecuting attorney of the appropriate county. 7458
(B) Notwithstanding any provision of section 2937.011 of 7459
the Revised Code to the contrary, a trial judge of a court of 7460
common pleas shall not release on bail pursuant to division (A) 7461
(2)(a)(A)(2) of this section a defendant who is convicted of a 7462
bailable offense if the defendant is sentenced to imprisonment 7463
for life or if that offense is a violation of section 2903.01, 7464
2903.02, 2903.03, 2903.04, 2903.11, 2905.01, 2905.02, 2905.11, 7465
2907.02, 2909.02, 2911.01, 2911.02, or 2911.11 of the Revised 7466
Code or is felonious sexual penetration in violation of former 7467
section 2907.12 of the Revised Code. 7468

bail pursuant to division (A)(2)(a)(A)(2) of this section a 7471
defendant who is convicted of a bailable offense and not 7472
sentenced to imprisonment for life, the appropriate court of 7473
appeals or two judges of it, upon motion of the defendant and 7474
for good cause shown, may release the defendant on bail in 7475
accordance with division (A)(2) of this section. 7476
Sec. 2953.10. When an appeal is taken from a court of 7477
appeals to the supreme court, the supreme court has the same 7478
power and authority to suspend the execution of sentence during 7479
the pendency of the appeal and admit the defendant to bail as 7480
does the court of appeals unless another section of the Revised 7481
Code or the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court specify a 7482
distinct bail or suspension of sentence authority. 7483
When an appeal in a case in which a sentence of death is 7484
imposed for an offense committed on or after January 1, 1995, is 7485
taken directly from the trial court to the supreme court, the 7486
supreme court has the same power and authority to suspend the 7487
execution of the sentence during the pendency of the appeal and 7488
admit the defendant to bail as does the court of appeals for 7489
cases in which a sentence of death is imposed for an offense 7490
committed before January 1, 1995, unless another section of the 7491
Revised Code or the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court 7492
specify a distinct bail or suspension of sentence authority. 7493
Sec. 2953.21. (A)(1)(a) A person in any either of the 7494
following categories may file a petition in the court that 7495
imposed sentence, stating the grounds for relief relied upon, 7496
and asking the court to vacate or set aside the judgment or 7497

(ii) Any person who has been convicted of a criminal 7504

altered verdict; 7508
(iii) Any person who has been convicted of a criminal 7509
offense that is a felony and who is an offender for whom DNA 7510

death; 7522
(iv) Any person who has been convicted of aggravated 7523
murder and sentenced to death for the offense and who claims 7524
that the person had a serious mental illness at the time of the 7525
commission of the offense and that as a result the court should 7526
render void the sentence of death, with the filing of the 7527
petition constituting the waiver described in division (A)(3)(b) 7528
of this section. 7529
(b) A petitioner under division (A)(1)(a) of this section 7530

the Revised Code been presented at trial, and had those results 7537
been analyzed in the context of and upon consideration of all 7538
available admissible evidence related to the person's case as 7539
described in division (D) of section 2953.74 of the Revised 7540
Code, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner 7541

accordance with divisions (A)(1)(e), (A)(1)(f), and (C) of this 7562
section, and to any other form of discovery as in a civil action 7563
that the court in its discretion permits. The court may limit 7564
the extent of discovery under this division. In addition to 7565
discovery that is relevant to the claim and was available under 7566
Criminal Rule 16 through conclusion of the original criminal 7567
trial, the court, for good cause shown, may authorize the 7568

material and that a deposition of the witness or the issuing of 7576
a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum is of assistance in order to 7577
substantiate or refute the petitioner's claim that there is a 7578
reasonable probability of an altered verdict. This division does 7579
not apply if the witness was unavailable for trial or would not 7580
voluntarily be interviewed by the defendant or prosecuting 7581
attorney. 7582
(ii) For any witness with respect to whom division (A)(1) 7583
(e)(i) of this section does not apply, the petitioner or 7584
prosecuting attorney shows good cause that the witness is 7585
material and that a deposition of the witness or the issuing of 7586
a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum is of assistance in order to 7587

attorney of the county served by the court requests 7605
postconviction discovery as described in that division, upon 7606
motion by the petitioner, the prosecuting attorney, or the 7607
person from whom discovery is sought, and for good cause shown, 7608

justice requires to protect a party or person from oppression or 7610
undue burden or expense, including but not limited to the orders 7611
described in divisions (A)(1)(h)(i) to (viii) of this section. 7612
The court also may make any such order if, in its discretion, it 7613
determines that the discovery sought would be irrelevant to the 7614
claims made in the petition; and if the court makes any such 7615
order on that basis, it shall explain in the order the reasons 7616
why the discovery would be irrelevant. 7617

The provisions of Civil Rule 37(A)(4) apply to the award of 7624
expenses incurred in relation to the motion, except that in no 7625
case shall a court require a petitioner who is indigent to pay 7626
expenses under those provisions. 7627
Before any person moves for an order under division (A)(1) 7628
(g) of this section, that person shall make a reasonable effort 7629
to resolve the matter through discussion with the petitioner or 7630
prosecuting attorney seeking discovery. A motion for an order 7631
under division (A)(1)(g) of this section shall be accompanied by 7632
a statement reciting the effort made to resolve the matter in 7633
accordance with this paragraph. 7634

(i) Any postconviction discovery authorized under division 7656
(A)(1)(e) of this section shall be completed not later than 7657
eighteen months after the start of the discovery proceedings 7658
unless, for good cause shown, the court extends that period for 7659
completing the discovery. 7660
(j) Nothing in division (A)(1)(e) of this section 7661
authorizes, or shall be construed as authorizing, the 7662
relitigation, or discovery in support of relitigation, of any 7663
matter barred by the doctrine of res judicata. 7664
(k) Division (A)(1) of this section does not apply to any 7665
person who has been convicted of a criminal offense and 7666
sentenced to death and who has unsuccessfully raised the same 7667
claims in a petition for postconviction relief. 7668

of the Revised Code, a petition under division (A)(1)(a)(i), 7670
(ii), or (iii) (A)(1)(a) of this section shall be filed no later 7671
than three hundred sixty-five days after the date on which the 7672
trial transcript is filed in the court of appeals in the direct 7673
appeal of the judgment of conviction or adjudication or, if the 7674
direct appeal involves a sentence of death, the date on which 7675

Revised Code, the petition shall be filed no later than three 7678
hundred sixty-five days after the expiration of the time for 7679
filing the appeal. 7680
(b) Except as otherwise provided in section 2953.23 of the 7681
Revised Code, a petition under division (A)(1)(a)(iv) of this 7682
section shall be filed not later than three hundred sixty-five 7683
days after the effective date of this amendment 7684
(3)(a) In a petition filed under division (A)(1)(a)(i), 7685
(ii), or (iii) of this section, a person who has been sentenced 7686
to death may ask the court to render void or voidable the 7687
judgment with respect to the conviction of aggravated murder or 7688
the specification of an aggravating circumstance or the sentence 7689
of death. 7690
(b) A person sentenced to death who files a petition under 7691
division (A)(1)(a)(iv) of this section may ask the court to 7692
render void the sentence of death and to order the resentencing 7693
of the person under division (A) of section 2929.06 of the 7694
Revised Code. If a person sentenced to death files such a 7695
petition and asks the court to render void the sentence of death 7696
and to order the resentencing of the person under division (A) 7697
of section 2929.06 of the Revised Code, the act of filing the 7698
petition constitutes a waiver of any right to be sentenced under 7699
the law that existed at the time the offense was committed and 7700
constitutes consent to be sentenced to life imprisonment without 7701
parole under division (A) of section 2929.06 of the Revised 7702
Code. 7703
(4)(3) A petitioner shall state in the original or amended 7704
petition filed under division (A) of this section all grounds 7705
for relief claimed by the petitioner. Except as provided in 7706
section 2953.23 of the Revised Code, any ground for relief that 7707

is not so stated in the petition is waived. 7708
(5) (4) If the petitioner in a petition filed under 7709
division (A)(1)(a)(i), (ii), or (iii) (A)(1)(a) of this section 7710
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a felony, the petition may 7711
include a claim that the petitioner was denied the equal 7712
protection of the laws in violation of the Ohio Constitution or 7713
the United States Constitution because the sentence imposed upon 7714
the petitioner for the felony was part of a consistent pattern 7715
of disparity in sentencing by the judge who imposed the 7716
sentence, with regard to the petitioner's race, gender, ethnic 7717
background, or religion. If the supreme court adopts a rule 7718
requiring a court of common pleas to maintain information with 7719
regard to an offender's race, gender, ethnic background, or 7720
religion, the supporting evidence for the petition shall 7721
include, but shall not be limited to, a copy of that type of 7722
information relative to the petitioner's sentence and copies of 7723
that type of information relative to sentences that the same 7724
judge imposed upon other persons. 7725
(6) Notwithstanding any law or court rule to the contrary, 7726
there is no limit on the number of pages in, or on the length 7727
of, a petition filed under division (A)(1)(a)(i), (ii), (iii), 7728
or (iv) of this section by a person who has been sentenced to 7729
death. If any court rule specifies a limit on the number of 7730
pages in, or on the length of, a petition filed under division 7731
(A)(1)(a)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section or on a 7732
prosecuting attorney's response to such a petition by answer or 7733
motion and a person who has been sentenced to death files a 7734
petition that exceeds the limit specified for the petition, the 7735
prosecuting attorney may respond by an answer or motion that 7736
exceeds the limit specified for the response. 7737

postconviction discovery described in division (A)(1)(e) of this 7740
section is filed shall docket the petition and the request and 7741
bring them it promptly to the attention of the court. The clerk 7742
of the court in which the petition for postconviction relief 7743
and, if applicable, a request for postconviction discovery 7744
described in division (A)(1)(e) of this section is filed 7745
immediately shall forward a copy of the petition and a copy of 7746
the request if filed by the petitioner to the prosecuting 7747
attorney of the county served by the court. If the request for 7748
postconviction discovery is filed by the prosecuting attorney, 7749
the clerk of the court immediately shall forward a copy of the 7750
request to the petitioner or the petitioner's counsel. 7751
(C) If a person who has been sentenced to death and who 7752
files a petition for postconviction relief under division (A)(1) 7753
(a)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section requests a 7754
deposition or the prosecuting attorney in the case requests a 7755
deposition, and if the court grants the request under division 7756
(A)(1)(e) of this section, the court shall notify the petitioner 7757
or the petitioner's counsel and the prosecuting attorney. The 7758
deposition shall be conducted pursuant to divisions (B), (D), 7759
and (E) of Criminal Rule 15. Notwithstanding division (C) of 7760
Criminal Rule 15, the petitioner is not entitled to attend the 7761
deposition. The prosecuting attorney shall be permitted to 7762
attend and participate in any deposition. 7763
(D) The court shall consider a petition that is timely 7764
filed within the period specified in division (A)(2) of this 7765
section even if a direct appeal of the judgment is pending. 7766
Before granting a hearing on a petition filed under division (A) 7767
(1)(a)(i), or (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section, the court 7768

relief. In making such a determination, the court shall 7770
consider, in addition to the petition, the supporting 7771
affidavits, and the documentary evidence, all the files and 7772
records pertaining to the proceedings against the petitioner, 7773
including, but not limited to, the indictment, the court's 7774
journal entries, the journalized records of the clerk of the 7775
court, and the court reporter's transcript. The court reporter's 7776
transcript, if ordered and certified by the court, shall be 7777
taxed as court costs. If the court dismisses the petition, it 7778
shall make and file findings of fact and conclusions of law with 7779
respect to such dismissal. If the petition was filed by a person 7780
who has been sentenced to death, the findings of fact and 7781
conclusions of law shall state specifically the reasons for the 7782
dismissal of the petition and of each claim it contains. 7783
(E) (D) Within ten days after the docketing of the 7784
petition, or within any further time that the court may fix for 7785
good cause shown, the prosecuting attorney shall respond by 7786
answer or motion. Division (A)(6) of this section applies with 7787
respect to the prosecuting attorney's response. Within twenty 7788
days from the date the issues are raised, either party may move 7789
for summary judgment. The right to summary judgment shall appear 7790
on the face of the record. 7791
(F) (E) Unless the petition and the files and records of 7792
the case show the petitioner is not entitled to relief, the 7793
court shall proceed to a prompt hearing on the issues even if a 7794
direct appeal of the case is pending. If the court notifies the 7795
parties that it has found grounds for granting relief, either 7796
party may request an appellate court in which a direct appeal of 7797
the judgment is pending to remand the pending case to the court. 7798

hearing that are set forth in divisions (C), (D), and (F) of 7802
section 2929.025 of the Revised Code apply in considering the 7803
petition. With respect to such a petition, the grounds for 7804
granting relief are that the person has been diagnosed with one 7805
or more of the conditions set forth in division (A)(1)(a) of 7806
section 2929.025 of the Revised Code and that, at the time of 7807
the aggravated murder that was the basis of the sentence of 7808
death, the condition or conditions significantly impaired the 7809
person's capacity in a manner described in division (A)(1)(b) of 7810
that section. 7811
(G) A petitioner who files a petition under division (A) 7812
(1)(a)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section may amend the 7813
petition as follows: 7814
(1) If the petition was filed by a person who has been 7815
sentenced to death, at any time that is not later than one 7816
hundred eighty days after the petition is filed, the petitioner 7817
may amend the petition with or without leave or prejudice to the 7818
proceedings. 7819
(2) If division (G)(1) of this section does not apply, at 7820
(F) At any time before the answer or motion is filed, the 7821
petitioner may amend the petition with or without leave or 7822
prejudice to the proceedings. 7823
(3) The petitioner may amend the petition with leave of 7824
court at any time after the expiration of the applicable period 7825
specified in division (G)(1) or (2) of this sectionthereafter. 7826
(H) (G) If the court does not find grounds for granting 7827

relief, it shall make and file findings of fact and conclusions 7828
of law and shall enter judgment denying relief on the petition. 7829
If the petition was filed by a person who has been sentenced to 7830
death, the findings of fact and conclusions of law shall state 7831
specifically the reasons for the denial of relief on the 7832
petition and of each claim it contains. If no direct appeal of 7833
the case is pending and the court finds grounds for relief or if 7834
a pending direct appeal of the case has been remanded to the 7835
court pursuant to a request made pursuant to division (F) (E) of 7836
this section and the court finds grounds for granting relief, it 7837
shall make and file findings of fact and conclusions of law and 7838
shall enter a judgment that vacates and sets aside the judgment 7839
in question, and, in the case of a petitioner who is a prisoner 7840
in custody, except as otherwise described in this division, 7841
shall discharge or resentence the petitioner or grant a new 7842
trial as the court determines appropriate. If the court finds 7843
grounds for relief in the case of a petitioner who filed a 7844
petition under division (A)(1)(a)(iv) of this section, the court 7845
shall render void the sentence of death and order the 7846
resentencing of the offender under division (A) of section 7847
2929.06 of the Revised Code. If the petitioner has been 7848
sentenced to death, the findings of fact and conclusions of law 7849
shall state specifically the reasons for the finding of grounds 7850
for granting the relief, with respect to each claim contained in 7851
the petition. The court also may make supplementary orders to 7852
the relief granted, concerning such matters as rearraignment, 7853
retrial, custody, and bail. If the trial court's order granting 7854
the petition is reversed on appeal and if the direct appeal of 7855
the case has been remanded from an appellate court pursuant to a 7856
request under division (F) (E) of this section, the appellate 7857
court reversing the order granting the petition shall notify the 7858
appellate court in which the direct appeal of the case was 7859

pending at the time of the remand of the reversal and remand of 7860
the trial court's order. Upon the reversal and remand of the 7861
trial court's order granting the petition, regardless of whether 7862
notice is sent or received, the direct appeal of the case that 7863
was remanded is reinstated. 7864
(I) Upon the filing of a petition pursuant to division (A) 7865
(1)(a)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section by a person 7866
sentenced to death, only the supreme court may stay execution of 7867
the sentence of death. 7868
(J)(1) If a person sentenced to death intends to file a 7869
petition under this section, the court shall appoint counsel to 7870
represent the person upon a finding that the person is indigent 7871
and that the person either accepts the appointment of counsel or 7872
is unable to make a competent decision whether to accept or 7873
reject the appointment of counsel. The court may decline to 7874
appoint counsel for the person only upon a finding, after a 7875
hearing if necessary, that the person rejects the appointment of 7876
counsel and understands the legal consequences of that decision 7877
or upon a finding that the person is not indigent. 7878
(2) The court shall not appoint as counsel under division 7879
(J)(1) of this section an attorney who represented the 7880
petitioner at trial in the case to which the petition relates 7881
unless the person and the attorney expressly request the 7882
appointment. The court shall appoint as counsel under division 7883
(J)(1) of this section only an attorney who is certified under 7884
Rule 20 of the Rules of Superintendence for the Courts of Ohio 7885
to represent indigent defendants charged with or convicted of an 7886
offense for which the death penalty can be or has been imposed. 7887
The ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during 7888
proceedings under this section does not constitute grounds for 7889

relief in a proceeding under this section, in an appeal of any 7890
action under this section, or in an application to reopen a 7891
direct appeal. 7892
(3) Division (J) of this section does not preclude 7893
attorneys who represent the state of Ohio from invoking the 7894
provisions of 28 U.S.C. 154 with respect to capital cases that 7895
were pending in federal habeas corpus proceedings prior to July 7896
1, 1996, insofar as the petitioners in those cases were 7897
represented in proceedings under this section by one or more 7898
counsel appointed by the court under this section or section 7899
120.06, 120.16, 120.26, or 120.33 of the Revised Code and those 7900
appointed counsel meet the requirements of division (J)(2) of 7901
this section. 7902
(K) (H) Subject to the appeal of a sentence for a felony 7903
that is authorized by section 2953.08 of the Revised Code, the 7904
remedy set forth in this section is the exclusive remedy by 7905
which a person may bring a collateral challenge to the validity 7906
of a conviction or sentence in a criminal case or to the 7907
validity of an adjudication of a child as a delinquent child for 7908
the commission of an act that would be a criminal offense if 7909
committed by an adult or the validity of a related order of 7910
disposition. 7911
Sec. 2953.23. (A) Whether a hearing is or is not held on a 7912
petition filed pursuant to section 2953.21 of the Revised Code, 7913
a court may not entertain a petition filed after the expiration 7914
of the period prescribed in division (A) of that section or a 7915
second petition or successive petitions for similar relief on 7916
behalf of a petitioner unless division (A)(1) or (2) of this 7917
section applies: 7918
(1) Both of the following apply: 7919

S. B. No. 134 Page 268
As Introduced
(a) Either the petitioner shows that the petitioner was 7920
unavoidably prevented from discovery of the facts upon which the 7921
petitioner must rely to present the claim for relief, or, 7922
subsequent to the period prescribed in division (A)(2) of 7923
section 2953.21 of the Revised Code or to the filing of an 7924
earlier petition, the United States Supreme Court recognized a 7925
new federal or state right that applies retroactively to persons 7926
in the petitioner's situation, and the petition asserts a claim 7927
based on that right. 7928
(b) The petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence 7929
that, but for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable 7930
factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense 7931
of which the petitioner was convicted or, if the claim 7932
challenges a sentence of death that, but for constitutional 7933
error at the sentencing hearing, no reasonable factfinder would 7934
have found the petitioner eligible for the death sentence. 7935
(2) The petitioner was convicted of a felony, the 7936
petitioner is an offender for whom DNA testing was performed 7937
under sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code or under 7938
former section 2953.82 of the Revised Code and analyzed in the 7939
context of and upon consideration of all available admissible 7940
evidence related to the inmate's case as described in division 7941
(D) of section 2953.74 of the Revised Code, and the results of 7942
the DNA testing establish, by clear and convincing evidence, 7943
actual innocence of that felony offense or, if the person was 7944
sentenced to death, establish, by clear and convincing evidence, 7945
actual innocence of the aggravating circumstance or 7946
circumstances the person was found guilty of committing and that 7947
is or are the basis of that sentence of death. 7948
As used in this division, "actual innocence" has the same 7949

meaning as in division (A)(1)(c) of section 2953.21 of the 7950
Revised Code, and "former section 2953.82 of the Revised Code" 7951
has the same meaning as in division (A)(1)(d) of section 2953.21 7952
of the Revised Code. 7953
(B) An order awarding or denying relief sought in a 7954
petition filed pursuant to section 2953.21 of the Revised Code 7955
is a final judgment and may be appealed pursuant to Chapter 7956
2953. of the Revised Code. 7957
If a petition filed pursuant to section 2953.21 of the 7958
Revised Code by a person who has been sentenced to death is 7959
denied and the person appeals the judgment, notwithstanding any 7960
law or court rule to the contrary, there is no limit on the 7961
number of pages in, or on the length of, a notice of appeal or 7962
briefs related to an appeal filed by the person. If any court 7963
rule specifies a limit on the number of pages in, or on the 7964
length of, a notice of appeal or briefs described in this 7965
division or on a prosecuting attorney's response or briefs with 7966
respect to such an appeal and a person who has been sentenced to 7967
death files a notice of appeal or briefs that exceed the limit 7968
specified for the petition, the prosecuting attorney may file a 7969
response or briefs that exceed the limit specified for the 7970
answer or briefs. 7971
Sec. 2953.71. As used in sections 2953.71 to 2953.83 of 7972
the Revised Code: 7973
(A) "Application" or "application for DNA testing" means a 7974
request through postconviction relief for the state to do DNA 7975
testing on biological material from the case in which the 7976
offender was convicted of the offense for which the offender is 7977
an eligible offender and is requesting the DNA testing under 7978
sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code. 7979

S. B. No. 134 Page 270

(B) "Biological material" means any product of a human 7980
body containing DNA. 7981
(C) "Chain of custody" means a record or other evidence 7982
that tracks a subject sample of biological material from the 7983
time the biological material was first obtained until the time 7984
it currently exists in its place of storage and, in relation to 7985
a DNA sample, a record or other evidence that tracks the DNA 7986
sample from the time it was first obtained until it currently 7987
exists in its place of storage. For purposes of this division, 7988
examples of when biological material or a DNA sample is first 7989
obtained include, but are not limited to, obtaining the material 7990
or sample at the scene of a crime, from a victim, from an 7991
offender, or in any other manner or time as is appropriate in 7992
the facts and circumstances present. 7993
(D) "Custodial agency" means the group or entity that has 7994
the responsibility to maintain biological material in question. 7995
(E) "Custodian" means the person who is the primary 7996
representative of a custodial agency. 7997
(F) "Eligible offender" means an offender who is eligible 7998
under division (C) of section 2953.72 of the Revised Code to 7999
request DNA testing to be conducted under sections 2953.71 to 8000
2953.81 of the Revised Code. 8001
(G) "Exclusion" or "exclusion result" means a result of 8002
DNA testing that scientifically precludes or forecloses the 8003
subject offender as a contributor of biological material 8004
recovered from the crime scene or victim in question, in 8005
relation to the offense for which the offender is an eligible 8006
offender and for which the sentence of death or prison term was 8007
imposed upon the offender. 8008

S. B. No. 134 Page 271
As Introduced
(H) "Extracting personnel" means medically approved 8009
personnel who are employed to physically obtain an offender's 8010

to 2953.81 of the Revised Code. 8012
(I) "Inclusion" or "inclusion result" means a result of 8013
DNA testing that scientifically cannot exclude, or that holds 8014
accountable, the subject offender as a contributor of biological 8015
material recovered from the crime scene or victim in question, 8016
in relation to the offense for which the offender is an eligible 8017
offender and for which the sentence of death or prison term was 8018
imposed upon the offender. 8019
(J) "Inconclusive" or "inconclusive result" means a result 8020
of DNA testing that is rendered when a scientifically 8021
appropriate and definitive DNA analysis or result, or both, 8022
cannot be determined. 8023
(K) "Offender" means a criminal offender who was sentenced 8024
by a court, or by a jury and a court, of this state. 8025
(L) "Outcome determinative" means that had the results of 8026
DNA testing of the subject offender been presented at the trial 8027
of the subject offender requesting DNA testing and been found 8028
relevant and admissible with respect to the felony offense for 8029
which the offender is an eligible offender and is requesting the 8030
DNA testing, and had those results been analyzed in the context 8031
of and upon consideration of all available admissible evidence 8032
related to the offender's case as described in division (D) of 8033
section 2953.74 of the Revised Code, there is a strong 8034
probability that no reasonable factfinder would have found the 8035
offender guilty of that offense or, if the offender was 8036
sentenced to death relative to that offense, would have found 8037
the offender guilty of the aggravating circumstance or 8038

S. B. No. 134 Page 272

obtained from a crime scene or a victim of an offense for which 8042
an offender is an eligible offender, and from which a sample 8043
will be presently taken to do a DNA comparison to the DNA of the 8044
subject offender under sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the 8045
Revised Code. 8046
(N) "Prison" and "community control sanction" have the 8047
same meanings as in section 2929.01 of the Revised Code. 8048
(O) "Prosecuting attorney" means the prosecuting attorney 8049

(P) "Prosecuting authority" means the prosecuting attorney 8053
or the attorney general. 8054
(Q) "Reasonable diligence" means a degree of diligence 8055

testing will be conducted under sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of 8060
the Revised Code. 8061

meanings as in section 2967.01 of the Revised Code. 8063
(T) "Sexually oriented offense" and "child-victim oriented 8064
offense" have the same meanings as in section 2950.01 of the 8065
Revised Code. 8066

S. B. No. 134 Page 273
As Introduced
(U) "Definitive DNA test" means a DNA test that clearly 8067
establishes that biological material from the perpetrator of the 8068
crime was recovered from the crime scene and also clearly 8069
establishes whether or not the biological material is that of 8070
the eligible offender. A prior DNA test is not definitive if the 8071
eligible offender proves by a preponderance of the evidence that 8072
because of advances in DNA technology there is a possibility of 8073
discovering new biological material from the perpetrator that 8074
the prior DNA test may have failed to discover. Prior testing 8075
may have been a prior "definitive DNA test" as to some 8076
biological evidence but may not have been a prior "definitive 8077
DNA test" as to other biological evidence. 8078
Sec. 2953.72. (A) Any eligible offender who wishes to 8079
request DNA testing under sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the 8080
Revised Code shall submit an application for the testing to the 8081
court of common pleas specified in section 2953.73 of the 8082
Revised Code, on a form prescribed by the attorney general for 8083
this purpose. The eligible offender shall submit the application 8084
in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 2953.73 8085
of the Revised Code. The eligible offender shall specify on the 8086
application the offense or offenses for which the offender is an 8087
eligible offender and is requesting the DNA testing. Along with 8088
the application, the eligible offender shall submit an 8089
acknowledgment that is on a form prescribed by the attorney 8090
general for this purpose and that is signed by the offender. The 8091
acknowledgment shall set forth all of the following: 8092
(1) That sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code 8093
contemplate applications for DNA testing of an eligible offender 8094
at a stage of a prosecution or case after the offender has been 8095
sentenced, that any exclusion or inclusion result of DNA testing 8096
rendered pursuant to those sections may be used by a party in 8097

S. B. No. 134 Page 274
As Introduced
any proceeding as described in section 2953.81 of the Revised 8098
Code, and that all requests for any DNA testing made at trial 8099
will continue to be handled by the prosecuting attorney in the 8100
case; 8101
(2) That the process of conducting postconviction DNA 8102
testing for an eligible offender under sections 2953.71 to 8103
2953.81 of the Revised Code begins when the offender submits an 8104
application under section 2953.73 of the Revised Code and the 8105
acknowledgment described in this section; 8106
(3) That the eligible offender must submit the application 8107
and acknowledgment to the court of common pleas that heard the 8108
case in which the offender was convicted of the offense for 8109
which the offender is an eligible offender and is requesting the 8110
DNA testing; 8111
(4) That the state has established a set of criteria set 8112
forth in section 2953.74 of the Revised Code by which eligible 8113
offender applications for DNA testing will be screened and that 8114
a judge of a court of common pleas upon receipt of a properly 8115
filed application and accompanying acknowledgment will apply 8116
those criteria to determine whether to accept or reject the 8117
application; 8118
(5) That the results of DNA testing conducted under 8119
sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code will be provided 8120
as described in section 2953.81 of the Revised Code to all 8121
parties in the postconviction proceedings and will be reported 8122
to various courts; 8123
(6) That, if DNA testing is conducted with respect to an 8124
offender under sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code, 8125
the state will not offer the offender a retest if an inclusion 8126

S. B. No. 134 Page 275
As Introduced
result is achieved relative to the testing and that, if the 8127
state were to offer a retest after an inclusion result, the 8128
policy would create an atmosphere in which endless testing could 8129
occur and in which postconviction proceedings could be stalled 8130
for many years; 8131
(7) That, if the court rejects an eligible offender's 8132
application for DNA testing because the offender does not 8133
satisfy the acceptance criteria described in division (A)(4) of 8134
this section, the court will not accept or consider subsequent 8135
applications; 8136
(8) That the acknowledgment memorializes the provisions of 8137
sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code with respect to 8138
the application of postconviction DNA testing to offenders, that 8139
those provisions do not give any offender any additional 8140
constitutional right that the offender did not already have, 8141
that the court has no duty or obligation to provide 8142
postconviction DNA testing to offenders, that the court of 8143
common pleas has the sole discretion subject to an appeal as 8144
described in this division to determine whether an offender is 8145
an eligible offender and whether an eligible offender's 8146
application for DNA testing satisfies the acceptance criteria 8147
described in division (A)(4) of this section and whether the 8148
application should be accepted or rejected, that if the court of 8149
common pleas rejects an eligible offender's application, the 8150
offender may seek leave of the supreme court to appeal the 8151
rejection to that court if the offender was sentenced to death 8152
for the offense for which the offender is requesting the DNA 8153
testing and, if the offender was not sentenced to death for that 8154
offense, may appeal the rejection to the court of appeals, and 8155
that no determination otherwise made by the court of common 8156
pleas in the exercise of its discretion regarding the 8157

S. B. No. 134 Page 276
As Introduced
eligibility of an offender or regarding postconviction DNA 8158
testing under those provisions is reviewable by or appealable to 8159
any court; 8160
(9) That the manner in which sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 8161
of the Revised Code with respect to the offering of 8162
postconviction DNA testing to offenders are carried out does not 8163
confer any constitutional right upon any offender, that the 8164
state has established guidelines and procedures relative to 8165
those provisions to ensure that they are carried out with both 8166
justice and efficiency in mind, and that an offender who 8167
participates in any phase of the mechanism contained in those 8168
provisions, including, but not limited to, applying for DNA 8169
testing and being rejected, having an application for DNA 8170
testing accepted and not receiving the test, or having DNA 8171
testing conducted and receiving unfavorable results, does not 8172
gain as a result of the participation any constitutional right 8173
to challenge, or, except as provided in division (A)(8) of this 8174
section, any right to any review or appeal of, the manner in 8175
which those provisions are carried out; 8176
(10) That the most basic aspect of sections 2953.71 to 8177
2953.81 of the Revised Code is that, in order for DNA testing to 8178
occur, there must be an offender sample against which other 8179
evidence may be compared, that, if an eligible offender's 8180
application is accepted but the offender subsequently refuses to 8181
submit to the collection of the sample of biological material 8182
from the offender or hinders the state from obtaining a sample 8183
of biological material from the offender, the goal of those 8184
provisions will be frustrated, and that an offender's refusal or 8185
hindrance shall cause the court to rescind its prior acceptance 8186
of the application for DNA testing for the offender and deny the 8187
application. 8188

(B) The attorney general shall prescribe a form to be used 8189
to make an application for DNA testing under division (A) of 8190
this section and section 2953.73 of the Revised Code and a form 8191
to be used to provide the acknowledgment described in division 8192
(A) of this section. The forms shall include all information 8193
described in division (A) of this section, spaces for an 8194
offender to insert all information necessary to complete the 8195
forms, including, but not limited to, specifying the offense or 8196
offenses for which the offender is an eligible offender and is 8197
requesting the DNA testing, and any other information or 8198
material the attorney general determines is necessary or 8199
relevant. The attorney general shall distribute copies of the 8200
prescribed forms to the department of rehabilitation and 8201
correction, the department shall ensure that each prison in 8202
which offenders are housed has a supply of copies of the forms, 8203
and the department shall ensure that copies of the forms are 8204
provided free of charge to any offender who requests them. 8205
(C)(1) An offender is eligible to request DNA testing to 8206
be conducted under sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised 8207
Code only if all of the following apply: 8208
(a) The offense for which the offender claims to be an 8209
eligible offender is a felony, and the offender was convicted by 8210

type described in division (A) of this section, if the offender 9743
is serving an indefinite term of imprisonment, if the offender 9744
is barred from being transferred or exchanged pursuant to the 9745
treaty due to the indefinite nature of the offender's term of 9746
imprisonment, and if in accordance with division (B)(2) of this 9747
section the director of rehabilitation and correction or the 9748
director's designee approves the offender for transfer or 9749
exchange pursuant to the treaty, the parole board, pursuant to 9750
rules adopted by the director, shall set a date certain for the 9751
release of the offender. To the extent possible, the date 9752
certain that is set shall be reasonably proportionate to the 9753
indefinite term of imprisonment that the offender is serving. 9754
The date certain that is set for the release of the offender 9755
shall be considered only for purposes of facilitating the 9756
international transfer or exchange of the offender, shall not be 9757
viable or actionable for any other purpose, and shall not create 9758
any expectation or guarantee of release. If an offender for whom 9759
a date certain for release is set under this division is not 9760
transferred to or exchanged with the foreign country pursuant to 9761
the treaty, the date certain is null and void, and the 9762

rules of this state pertaining to parole eligibility and the 9764
duration and calculation of an indefinite sentence of 9765
imprisonment. 9766

determining whether to approve a convicted offender who is 9774
serving a term of imprisonment in this state for transfer or 9775
exchange pursuant to a treaty of the type described in division 9776

(1) The nature of the offense for which the offender is 9778
serving the term of imprisonment in this state; 9779
(2) The likelihood that, if the offender is transferred or 9780
exchanged to a foreign country pursuant to the treaty, the 9781
offender will serve a shorter period of time in imprisonment in 9782
the foreign country than the offender would serve if the 9783
offender is not transferred or exchanged to the foreign country 9784
pursuant to the treaty; 9785
(3) The likelihood that, if the offender is transferred or 9786
exchanged to a foreign country pursuant to the treaty, the 9787
offender will return or attempt to return to this state after 9788
the offender has been released from imprisonment in the foreign 9789
country; 9790
(4) The degree of any shock to the conscience of justice 9791
and society that will be experienced in this state if the 9792
