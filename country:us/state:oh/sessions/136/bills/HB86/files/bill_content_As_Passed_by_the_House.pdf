The annual report of a county land reutilization 379
corporation required by section 1724.05 of the Revised Code 380
shall include information regarding the amount and use of the 381
moneys that the corporation received from the treasurer's 382
delinquent tax and assessment collection fund and the county 383
land reutilization corporation fund. 384
(D)(1) In any county, if the county treasurer or 385
prosecuting attorney determines that the balance to the credit 386
of that officer's corresponding delinquent tax and assessment 387
collection fund exceeds the amount required to be used as 388
prescribed by division (A) of this section, the county treasurer 389
or prosecuting attorney may expend the excess to prevent 390
residential mortgage foreclosures in the county and to address 391
problems associated with other foreclosed real property. The 392
amount used for that purpose in any year may not exceed the 393
amount that would cause the fund to have a reserve of less than 394
twenty per cent of the amount expended in the preceding year for 395
the purposes of division (A) of this section. 396
Money authorized to be expended under division (D)(1) of 397
this section shall be used to provide financial assistance in 398
the form of loans to borrowers in default on their home 399
mortgages, including for the payment of late fees, to clear 400

H. B. No. 86 Page 15
As Passed by the House
arrearage balances, and to augment moneys used in the county's 401
foreclosure prevention program. The money also may be used to 402
assist county land reutilization corporations, municipal 403
corporations, or townships in the county, upon their application 404
to the county treasurer, prosecuting attorney, or the county 405
department of development, in the nuisance abatement of 406
deteriorated residential buildings in foreclosure, or vacant, 407
abandoned, tax-delinquent, or blighted real property, including 408
paying the costs of boarding up such buildings, lot maintenance, 409
and demolition. 410
(2) In a county having a population of more than one 411
hundred thousand according to the department of development's 412
2006 census estimate, if the county treasurer or prosecuting 413
attorney determines that the balance to the credit of that 414
officer's corresponding delinquent tax and assessment collection 415
fund exceeds the amount required to be used as prescribed by 416
division (A) of this section, the county treasurer or 417
prosecuting attorney may expend the excess to assist county land 418
reutilization corporations, townships, or municipal corporations 419
located in the county as provided in division (D)(2) of this 420
section, provided that the combined amount so expended each year 421
in a county shall not exceed five million dollars. Upon 422
application for the funds by a county land reutilization 423
corporation, township, or municipal corporation, the county 424
treasurer or prosecuting attorney may assist the county land 425
reutilization corporation, township, or municipal corporation in 426
abating foreclosed residential nuisances, including paying the 427
costs of securing such buildings, lot maintenance, and 428
demolition. At the prosecuting attorney's discretion, the 429
prosecuting attorney also may apply the funds to costs of 430
prosecuting alleged violations of criminal and civil laws 431

governing real estate and related transactions, including fraud 432
and abuse. 433
Sec. 321.263. A county land reutilization corporation fund 434
shall be established in the county treasury of each county in 435
which a county land reutilization corporation has been organized 436
under Chapter 1724. of the Revised Code and in which. Any amount 437
in the county land reutilization corporation fund appropriated 438
by a board of county commissioners shall be paid to the 439
corporation, upon the corporation's written request, by the 440
county treasurer upon the warrant of the county auditor. 441
If the county treasurer has made advance payments under 442
section 321.341 of the Revised Code. The, the county treasurer 443
shall credit all penalties and interest on the current year 444
unpaid taxes and the current year delinquent taxes advanced to 445
the county land reutilization corporation fund as provided under 446
section 321.341 of the Revised Code when the current year unpaid 447
taxes and current year delinquent taxes are collected. 448
Any amount in the county land reutilization corporation 449
fund appropriated by a board of county commissioners shall be 450
paid to the corporation, upon its written request, by the county 451
treasurer upon the warrant of the county auditor. At the end of 452
the year immediately following the year in which an amount of 453
penalties and interest was deposited in the county land 454
reutilization corporation fund, any balance of that amount of 455
penalties and interest remaining in the fund shall be encumbered 456
for the repayment of any borrowed money, and interest accrued 457
thereon, that was used to make an advance payment under section 458
321.341 of the Revised Code, and that has not yet been repaid. 459
The balance remaining in the fund from any amount of penalties 460
and interest deposited in the fund shall be determined as if all 461

H. B. No. 86 Page 17
As Passed by the House
amounts deposited into the fund are drawn from the fund on a 462
first-in, first-out basis. The amount encumbered shall not 463
exceed the county's aggregate liability for the borrowed money 464
and interest, and shall be determined as if the liability were 465
to be discharged on the termination or maturity date of the 466
instrument under which the money was borrowed. If the balance of 467
penalties and interest is not or will not be reserved for 468
appropriation or reappropriation to the corporation in a 469
succeeding fiscal year, it shall be transferred by the county 470
treasurer to the undivided general tax fund of the county. Such 471
amounts of penalties and interest shall be apportioned and 472
distributed to the appropriate taxing districts in the same 473
manner as the distribution of delinquent taxes and assessments. 474
Sec. 321.343. A county treasurer of a county in which a 475
county land reutilization corporation has been organized under 476
Chapter 1724. of the Revised Code may enter into an agreement 477
with the county land reutilization corporation for the benefit 478
of the holders of debt obligations of the corporation for the 479
repayment of which will be pledged the penalties and interest on 480
current year unpaid taxes and current year delinquent taxes, as 481
defined in and available under section 321.341 of the Revised 482
Code. The pledge agreement may include, without limitation, a 483
pledge by the county treasurer of and a grant of a security 484
interest in the penalties and interest deposited into the county 485
land reutilization corporation fund to the payment of debt 486
service on the debt obligations and a covenant of the county 487
treasurer to continue to make the special tax advances 488
authorized under section 321.341 of the Revised Code when the 489
debt obligations remain outstanding if necessary to generate 490
from the penalties and interest at least the amount needed to 491
pay the debt service on the debt obligations when due. The 492

H. B. No. 86 Page 18
As Passed by the House
penalties and interest so pledged and so deposited are 493
immediately subject to the pledge and security interest without 494
any physical delivery thereof or further act. The pledge and 495
security interest are valid, binding, and enforceable against 496
all parties having claims of any kind against the county land 497
reutilization corporation or the county treasurer, irrespective 498
of notice thereof, and such pledge and grant of a security 499
interest creates a perfected security interest for all purposes 500
of Chapter 1309. of the Revised Code, without the necessity for 501
separation or delivery or possession of the pledged penalties 502
and interest, or for the filing or recording of the document by 503
which the pledge and security interest are created. The 504
penalties and interest so deposited may be applied to the 505
purposes for which pledged without necessity for any act of 506
appropriation. The performance under this pledge agreement is 507
expressly determined and declared to be a duty specifically 508
enjoined by law upon the county treasurer and each officer and 509
employee having authority to perform the duty of the county 510
treasurer resulting from an office, trust, or station, within 511
the meaning of section 2731.01 of the Revised Code, enforceable 512
by writ of mandamus. 513
Sec. 323.25. (A) When taxes charged against an entry on 514
the tax duplicate, or any part of those taxes, are not paid 515
within sixty days after delivery of the delinquent land 516
duplicate to the county treasurer as prescribed by section 517
5721.011 of the Revised Code, the county treasurer shall enforce 518
the lien for the taxes by civil action in the treasurer's 519
official capacity as treasurer, for the sale of such premises in 520
the same way mortgage liens are enforced or for the transfer of 521
such premises to an electing subdivision pursuant to section 522
323.28 or 323.78 of the Revised Code, in the court of common 523

H. B. No. 86 Page 19
As Passed by the House
pleas of the county, or in a municipal court with jurisdiction, 524
or in the county board of revision with jurisdiction pursuant to 525
section 323.66 of the Revised Code. Nothing in this section 526
prohibits the treasurer from instituting such an action before 527
the delinquent tax list or delinquent vacant land tax list that 528
includes the premises has been published pursuant to division 529
(B) of section 5721.03 of the Revised Code if the list is not 530
published within the time prescribed by that division. 531
(B) After the civil action has been instituted, but before 532
the expiration of the applicable redemption period, any person 533
entitled to redeem the land may do so by tendering to the county 534
treasurer an amount sufficient, as determined by the court or 535
board of revision, to pay the taxes, assessments, penalties, 536
interest, and charges then due and unpaid, and the costs 537
incurred in the civil action, and by demonstrating that the 538
property is in compliance with all applicable zoning 539
regulations, land use restrictions, and building, health, and 540
safety codes. 541
(C) If the delinquent land duplicate lists minerals or 542
rights to minerals listed pursuant to sections 5713.04, 5713.05, 543
and 5713.06 of the Revised Code, the county treasurer may 544
enforce the lien for taxes against such minerals or rights to 545
minerals by civil action, in the treasurer's official capacity 546
as treasurer, in the manner prescribed by this section, or 547
proceed as provided under section 5721.46 of the Revised Code. 548
(D) If service by publication is necessary, instead of as 549
provided by the Rules of Civil Procedure, such publication shall 550
either be made (1) once a week for three consecutive weeks in a 551
newspaper of general circulation in the county or (2) once in a 552
newspaper of general circulation in the county and, beginning 553

H. B. No. 86 Page 20
As Passed by the House
one week thereafter, on a web site of the county or of the 554
court, as selected by the clerk of the court. Publication on the 555
web site shall continue until one year after the date a finding 556
is entered under section 323.28 of the Revised Code with respect 557
to such property. Any notices published on a web site shall 558
identify the date the notice is first published on the web site. 559
If proceeding under division (D)(1) of this section, the second 560
and third publication of the notice may be abbreviated as 561
authorized under section 7.16 of the Revised Code. 562
Service shall be complete, if proceeding under division 563
(D)(1) of this section, at the expiration of three weeks after 564
the date of the first publication or, if proceeding under 565
division (D)(2) of this section, the date that is two weeks 566
after the clerk causes the notice to be published on the 567
selected web site. If the prosecuting attorney determines that 568
service upon a defendant may be obtained ultimately only by 569
publication, the prosecuting attorney may cause service to be 570
made simultaneously by certified mail, return receipt requested, 571
ordinary mail, and publication. 572
(E) The county treasurer shall not enforce the lien for 573
taxes against real property to which any of the following 574
applies: 575
(1) The real property is the subject of an application for 576
exemption from taxation under section 5715.27 of the Revised 577
Code and does not appear on the delinquent land duplicate; 578
(2) The real property is the subject of a valid delinquent 579
tax contract under section 323.31 of the Revised Code for which 580
the county treasurer has not made certification to the county 581
auditor that the delinquent tax contract has become void in 582
accordance with that section; 583

H. B. No. 86 Page 21
As Passed by the House
(3) A tax certificate respecting that property has been 584
sold under section 5721.32 or 5721.33 of the Revised Code; 585
provided, however, that nothing in this division shall prohibit 586
the county treasurer or the county prosecuting attorney from 587
enforcing the lien of the state and its political subdivisions 588
for taxes against a certificate parcel with respect to any or 589
all of such taxes that at the time of enforcement of such lien 590
are not the subject of a tax certificate. 591
(F) Upon application of the plaintiff, the court shall 592
advance such cause on the docket, so that it may be first heard. 593
The court may order that the proceeding be transferred to 594
the county board of revision if so authorized under section 595
323.691 of the Revised Code. 596
Sec. 323.26. Having made named the proper parties in a 597
suit under section 323.25 of the Revised Code, it shall be 598
sufficient for the county treasurer to allege in the treasurer's 599
petition that the taxes are charged on the tax duplicate against 600
lands, lots, or parcels thereof, the amount of the taxes, and 601
that the taxes are unpaid, and the treasurer shall not be 602
required to set forth in the petition any other or further 603
special matter relating to such taxes. A certified copy of the 604
entry on the tax duplicate or an affidavit from the county 605
treasurer or deputy treasurer describing the lands, lots, or 606
parcels and the amount of the taxes, assessments, charges, 607
interest, and penalties due and unpaid, and stating that the 608
amount has been certified by the auditor to the county treasurer 609
as delinquent shall be prima-facie evidence of such allegations 610
and the validity of the taxes. In the petition, the county 611
treasurer of a county in which a county land reutilization 612
corporation is organized under Chapter 1724. of the Revised Code 613

H. B. No. 86 Page 22
As Passed by the House
may invoke the alternative redemption period provided under 614
section 323.78 of the Revised Code. Notwithstanding the 615
provisions for sale of property foreclosed under Chapters 323. 616
and 5721. of the Revised Code, if the treasurer's petition 617
invokes the alternative redemption period, upon the expiration 618
of the alternative redemption period, title to the parcels may 619
be transferred by deed to a municipal corporation, county, 620
township, school district, or a county land reutilization 621
corporation in accordance with section 323.78 of the Revised 622
Code. 623
Sec. 323.28. (A) A finding shall be entered in a 624
proceeding under section 323.25 of the Revised Code for taxes, 625
assessments, penalties, interest, and charges due and payable at 626
the time the deed of real property sold or transferred under 627
this section is transferred to the purchaser or transferee, plus 628
the cost of the proceeding. For purposes of determining such 629
amount, the county treasurer may estimate the amount of taxes, 630
assessments, interest, penalties, charges, and costs that will 631
be payable at the time the deed of the property is transferred 632
to the purchaser or transferee. 633
The court of common pleas, or a municipal court with 634
jurisdiction, or the county board of revision with jurisdiction 635
pursuant to section 323.66 of the Revised Code shall order such 636
premises to be transferred pursuant to division (E) of this 637
section or shall order such premises to be sold for payment of 638
the finding, but for not less than either of the following, 639
unless the county treasurer applies for an appraisal: 640
(1) The total amount of such finding; 641
(2) The fair market appraised value of the premises, as 642
determined by the county auditor for taxation purposes, plus the 643

H. B. No. 86 Page 23
As Passed by the House
cost of the proceeding. 644
If the county treasurer applies for an appraisal, the 645
premises shall be appraised in the manner provided by section 646
2329.17 of the Revised Code, and shall be sold for at least two- 647
thirds of the appraised value. 648
Notwithstanding the minimum sales price provisions of 649
divisions (A)(1) and (2) of this section to the contrary, a 650
parcel sold pursuant to this section shall not be sold for less 651
than the amount described in division (A)(1) of this section if 652
the highest bidder is the owner of record of the parcel 653
immediately prior to the judgment of foreclosure or a member of 654
the following class of parties connected to that owner: a member 655
of that owner's immediate family, a person with a power of 656
attorney appointed by that owner who subsequently transfers the 657
parcel to the owner, a sole proprietorship owned by that owner 658
or a member of the owner's immediate family, or partnership, 659
trust, business trust, corporation, or association in which the 660
owner or a member of the owner's immediate family owns or 661
controls directly or indirectly more than fifty per cent. If a 662
parcel sells for less than the amount described in division (A) 663
(1) of this section, the officer conducting the sale shall 664
require the buyer to complete an affidavit stating that the 665
buyer is not the owner of record immediately prior to the 666
judgment of foreclosure or a member of the specified class of 667
parties connected to that owner, and the affidavit shall become 668
part of the court records of the proceeding. If the county 669
auditor discovers within three years after the date of the sale 670
that a parcel was sold to that owner or a member of the 671
specified class of parties connected to that owner for a price 672
less than the amount so described, and if the parcel is still 673
owned by that owner or a member of the specified class of 674

H. B. No. 86 Page 24
As Passed by the House
parties connected to that owner, the auditor within thirty days 675
after such discovery shall add the difference between that 676
amount and the sale price to the amount of taxes that then stand 677
charged against the parcel and is payable at the next succeeding 678
date for payment of real property taxes. As used in this 679
paragraph, "immediate family" means a spouse who resides in the 680
same household and children. 681
(B) From the proceeds of the sale the costs shall be first 682
paid, next the amount found due for taxes, then the amount of 683
any taxes accruing after the entry of the finding and before the 684
deed of the property is transferred to the purchaser following 685
the sale, all of which taxes shall be deemed satisfied, though 686
the amount applicable to them is deficient, and any balance 687
shall be distributed according to section 5721.20 of the Revised 688
Code. No statute of limitations shall apply to such action. Upon 689
sale, all liens for taxes due at the time the deed of the 690
property is transferred to the purchaser following the sale, and 691
liens subordinate to liens for taxes, shall be deemed satisfied 692
and discharged unless otherwise provided by the order of sale. 693
(C) If the county treasurer's estimate of the amount of 694
the finding under division (A) of this section exceeds the 695
amount of taxes, assessments, interest, penalties, and costs 696
actually payable when the deed is transferred to the purchaser, 697
the officer who conducted the sale shall refund to the purchaser 698
the difference between the estimate and the amount actually 699
payable. If the amount of taxes, assessments, interest, 700
penalties, and costs actually payable when the deed is 701
transferred to the purchaser exceeds the county treasurer's 702
estimate, the officer shall certify the amount of the excess to 703
the treasurer, who shall enter that amount on the real and 704
public utility property tax duplicate opposite the property; the 705

H. B. No. 86 Page 25
As Passed by the House
amount of the excess shall be payable at the next succeeding 706
date prescribed for payment of taxes in section 323.12 of the 707
Revised Code, and shall not be deemed satisfied and discharged 708
pursuant to division (B) of this section. 709
(D) Premises ordered to be sold under this section but 710
remaining unsold for want of bidders after being offered for 711
sale on two separate occasions, not less than two weeks apart, 712
or after being offered for sale on one occasion in the case of 713
abandoned land as defined in section 323.65 of the Revised Code 714
or nonproductive land as defined in section 5722.01 of the 715
Revised Code, shall be forfeited to the state or to a political 716
subdivision, school district, or county land reutilization 717
corporation pursuant to Chapter 5722. or section 5723.01 of the 718
Revised Code, and shall be disposed of pursuant to Chapter 5722. 719
or 5723. of the Revised Code. 720
(E) (E)(1) As used in division (E) of this section: 721
(a) "Abandoned land" has the same meaning as in section 722
323.65 of the Revised Code; 723
(b) "Nonproductive land" and "electing subdivision" have 724
the same meanings as in section 5722.01 of the Revised Code. 725
(2) Notwithstanding section 5722.03 of the Revised Code, 726
and subject to section 5721.193 of the Revised Code, if the 727
complaint alleges that the property is delinquent vacant land as 728
defined in section 5721.01 of the Revised Code, abandoned lands 729
as defined in section 323.65 of the Revised Code, land or lands 730
described in division (F) of section 5722.01 of the Revised 731
Codenonproductive land, and if an electing subdivision indicates 732
its desire to acquire the parcel by way of an affidavit filed in 733
the case prior to the adjudication of foreclosure, and if the 734

H. B. No. 86 Page 26
As Passed by the House
value of the taxes, assessments, penalties, interest, and all 735
other charges and costs of the action exceed the auditor's fair 736
market appraised value of the parcel for taxation purposes, then 737
the court or board of revision having jurisdiction over the 738
matter on motion of the plaintiff, or on the court's or board's 739
own motion, shall, upon any adjudication of foreclosure, order, 740
without appraisal and without sale, the fee simple title of the 741
property to be transferred to and vested in an electing 742
subdivision as defined in division (A) of section 5722.01 of the 743
Revised Code. For purposes of determining whether the taxes, 744
assessments, penalties, interest, and all other charges and 745
costs of the action exceed the actual fair market value of the 746
parcel, the auditor's most current valuation shall be rebuttably 747
presumed to be, and constitute prima-facie evidence of, the fair 748
market value of the parcel. In such case, the 749
(3) The filing for journalization of a decree of 750
foreclosure ordering that direct transfer without appraisal or 751
sale shall constitute constitutes confirmation of the transfer 752
and thereby terminate terminates any further statutory or common 753
law right of redemption. 754
(4) Upon the journalization of a decree of foreclosure 755
ordering direct transfer without appraisal and sale pursuant to 756
division (E)(2) of this section, the sheriff shall execute and 757
record a deed transferring the property to the electing 758
subdivision named in the order, subject to division (H) of 759
section 5721.19 of the Revised Code. Once the deed is recorded, 760
title to the property is incontestable in the electing 761
subdivision and free and clear of all liens for taxes, 762
penalties, interest, charges, assessments, and all other liens 763
and encumbrances, except for easements and covenants of record 764
running with the land and created prior to the time at which the 765

H. B. No. 86 Page 27
As Passed by the House
taxes or assessments, for the nonpayment of which the abandoned 766
land or nonproductive land was transferred to the electing 767
subdivision, became due and payable. 768
(F) Whenever the officer charged to conduct the sale 769
offers any parcel for sale, the officer first shall read aloud a 770
complete legal description of the parcel, or in the alternative, 771
may read aloud only a summary description and a parcel number if 772
the county has adopted a permanent parcel number system and if 773
the advertising notice published prior to the sale includes a 774
complete legal description or indicates where the complete legal 775
description may be obtained. 776
Sec. 323.31. (A)(1) A person who owns agricultural real 777
property or owns and occupies residential real property or a 778
manufactured or mobile home that does not have an outstanding 779
tax lien certificate or judgment of foreclosure against it, and 780
a person who is a vendee of such property under a purchase 781
agreement or land contract and who occupies the property, shall 782
have at least one opportunity to pay any delinquent or unpaid 783
current taxes, or both, charged against the property by entering 784
into a written delinquent tax contract with the county treasurer 785
in a form prescribed or approved by the tax commissioner. 786
Subsequent opportunities to enter into a delinquent tax contract 787
shall be at the county treasurer's sole discretion. 788
(2) The treasurer may enter into a delinquent tax contract 789
in accordance with division (A) of this section with an owner or 790
vendee of real property, other than residential real property or 791
a manufactured or mobile home that is occupied by the owner, and 792
other than agricultural real property. 793

auditor, who shall attach the copy to the delinquent land tax 808
certificate, delinquent vacant land tax certificate, or the 809
delinquent manufactured home tax list, or who shall enter an 810
asterisk in the margin next to the entry for the tract or lot on 811
the master list of delinquent tracts, master list of delinquent 812

prescribed by sections 323.65 to 323.79 of the Revised Code. 1260
(2) If a certificate holder or county land reutilization 1261
corporation compiles a list of parcels under division (A) of 1262
this section that the certificate holder determines to be 1263
abandoned lands suitable for disposition under sections 323.65 1264
to 323.79 of the Revised Code, the certificate holder or 1265
corporation may proceed under sections 323.68 and 323.69 of the 1266

Revised Code, the county auditor or county treasurer may compile 1269
or certify a list of abandoned lands in any manner and at such 1270

corporation compiles a list of the parcels that the certificate 1281
holder or corporation determines to be abandoned land under 1282
division (A) of section 323.67 of the Revised Code, the 1283
certificate holder or corporation shall cause a title search to 1284
be conducted for the purpose of identifying any lienholders or 1285
other persons having a legal or equitable ownership interest or 1286
other security interest of record in the abandoned land. 1287
(B) Notwithstanding section 5301.252 of the Revised Code, 1288
an affidavit of a type described in that section shall not be 1289
considered a lien or encumbrance on the abandoned land, and the 1290
recording of an affidavit of a type described in that section 1291
shall not serve in any way to impede the bona fide purchaser 1292
status of the purchaser of any abandoned land sold at public 1293
auction under sections 323.65 to 323.79 of the Revised Code or 1294
of any other recipient of abandoned land transferred under those 1295
sections. However, any affiant who records an affidavit pursuant 1296
to section 5301.252 of the Revised Code shall be given notice 1297

and for the equity of redemption on each parcel. The complaint 1307
shall name all parties having any interest of record in the 1308
abandoned land that was discovered in the title search. The 1309
prosecuting attorney, county land reutilization corporation, or 1310
certificate holder may file such a complaint regardless of 1311
whether the parcel has appeared on a delinquent tax list or 1312
delinquent vacant land tax list published pursuant to division 1313
(B) of section 5721.03 of the Revised Code. 1314
(B)(1) In accordance with Civil Rule 4, the clerk of court 1315
promptly shall serve notice of the summons and the complaint 1316
filed under division (A) of this section to the last known 1317
address of the record owner of the abandoned land and to the 1318
last known address of each lienholder or other person having a 1319
legal or equitable ownership interest or security interest of 1320
record identified by the title search. The notice shall inform 1321
the addressee that delinquent taxes stand charged against the 1322
abandoned land; that the land will be sold at public auction or 1323
otherwise disposed of if not redeemed by the owner or other 1324
addressee; that the sale or transfer will occur at a date, time, 1325

may redeem the land by paying the total of the impositions 1328
against the land in accordance with section 323.25 of the 1329
Revised Code, at any time before confirmation of sale or 1330
transfer of the parcel as prescribed in sections 323.65 to 1331
323.79 of the Revised Code or before the expiration of the 1332
alternative redemption period, as may be applicable to the 1333
proceeding; that the case is being prosecuted by the prosecuting 1334
attorney of the county or its designated counsel in the name of 1335

H. B. No. 86 Page 46
As Passed by the House
the county treasurer for the county in which the abandoned land 1336

case number for the action, which shall be maintained in the 1340
official file and docket of the clerk of court; and that all 1341
subsequent pleadings, petitions, and papers associated with the 1342
case and filed by any interested party must be filed with the 1343
clerk of court and will become part of the case file for the 1344
board of revision. 1345
(2) The notice required by division (B)(1) of this section 1346
also shall inform the addressee that any owner of record may, at 1347
any time on or before the fourteenth day after service of 1348
process is perfected on such owner, file a pleading with the 1349
clerk of court requesting that the board transfer the case to a 1350
court of competent jurisdiction to be conducted in accordance 1351
with the applicable laws. 1352
(C) Subject to division (D) of this section, subsequent 1353
pleadings, motions, or papers associated with the case and filed 1354
with the clerk of court shall be served upon all parties of 1355
record in accordance with Civil Rules 4 and 5, except that 1356
service by publication in any case requiring such service shall 1357
require that any such publication shall be advertised in the 1358
manner, and for the time periods and frequency, prescribed in 1359
section 5721.18 of the Revised Code. Any inadvertent 1360
noncompliance with those rules does not serve to defeat or 1361
terminate the case, or subject the case to dismissal, as long as 1362
actual notice or service of filed papers is shown by a 1363
preponderance of the evidence or is acknowledged by the party 1364
charged with notice or service, including by having made an 1365
appearance or filing in relation to the case. The county board 1366

H. B. No. 86 Page 47
As Passed by the House

of process, service of process, or sufficiency of service of 1368
papers in any proceeding arising from a complaint filed under 1369
this section. Other than the notice and service provisions 1370
contained in Civil Rules 4 and 5, the Rules of Civil Procedure 1371
shall not be applicable to the proceedings of the board. The 1372
board of revision may utilize procedures contained in the Rules 1373
of Civil Procedure to the extent that such use facilitates the 1374
needs of the proceedings, such as vacating orders, correcting 1375
clerical mistakes, and providing notice to parties. To the 1376
extent not otherwise provided in sections 323.65 to 323.79 of 1377
the Revised Code, the board may apply the procedures prescribed 1378
by sections 323.25 to 323.28 or Chapters 5721., 5722., and 5723. 1379
of the Revised Code. Board practice shall be in accordance with 1380
the practice and rules, if any, of the board that are 1381
promulgated by the board under section 323.66 of the Revised 1382
Code and are not inconsistent with sections 323.65 to 323.79 of 1383
the Revised Code. 1384
(D)(1) A party shall be deemed to be in default of the 1385
proceedings in an action brought under sections 323.65 to 323.79 1386
of the Revised Code if either of the following occurs: 1387
(a) The party fails to appear at any hearing after being 1388
served with notice of the summons and complaint by certified or 1389
ordinary mail. 1390
(b) For a party upon whom notice of summons and complaint 1391
is required by publication as provided under section 5721.18 of 1392
the Revised Code and has been considered complete pursuant to 1393
that section, the party fails to appear, move, or plead to the 1394
complaint within twenty-eight days after service by publication 1395
is considered complete. 1396

H. B. No. 86 Page 48
As Passed by the House
(2) If a party is deemed to be in default pursuant to 1397
division (D)(1) of this section, no further service of any 1398
subsequent pleadings, papers, or proceedings is required on the 1399
party by the court or any other party. 1400
(E) At any time after a foreclosure action is filed under 1401
this section, the county board of revision may, upon its own 1402
motion, transfer the case to a court pursuant to section 323.691 1403
of the Revised Code if it determines, upon a preponderance of 1404
the evidence provided by the parties, that, given the complexity 1405
of the case or other circumstances, a court would be a more 1406
appropriate forum for the action the property is not abandoned 1407
land. 1408
Sec. 323.691. (A)(1) A county board of revision may order 1409
that a proceeding arising from a complaint filed under section 1410
323.69 of the Revised Code be transferred to the court of common 1411
pleas or to a municipal court with jurisdiction. The board may 1412
only order such a transfer upon the board's own motion, pursuant 1413
to division (E) of section 323.69 of the Revised Code, or upon 1414
motion of one of the following: 1415
(a) The record owner of the parcel, provided that the 1416
motion is filed on or before the fourteenth day after service of 1417
process is perfected under division (B) of section 323.69 of the 1418
Revised Code or the ; 1419
(b) The county prosecuting attorney or designated counsel 1420
hired by the prosecuting attorney, representing the county 1421
treasurer, or upon its own motion; 1422

H. B. No. 86 Page 49
As Passed by the House
(2) A court of common pleas or municipal court may order 1426
that a proceeding arising from a complaint filed under sections 1427
323.25 to 323.28 or Chapter 5721. of the Revised Code be 1428
transferred to a county board of revision if the court 1429
determines that the real property that is the subject of the 1430
complaint is abandoned land, provided that the appropriate board 1431
of revision has adopted a resolution under section 323.66 of the 1432
Revised Code to adjudicate cases as provided under sections 1433
323.65 to 323.79 of the Revised Code. There is a rebuttable 1434
presumption that a parcel of land is unoccupied if any of the 1435
factors described in division (F)(2) of section 323.65 of the 1436
Revised Code apply to the parcel. The court may order a transfer 1437
under this division upon the motion of the record owner of the 1438
parcel or , the county prosecuting attorney or designated 1439
counsel hired by the prosecuting attorney, representing the 1440
county treasurer, or upon its own motion. 1441
(B) On or before the twenty-eighth day after the 1442
journalization of an order of transfer issued pursuant to 1443
division (A) of this section, the county prosecuting attorney or 1444
designated counsel hired by the prosecuting attorney shall file 1445
a copy of the journalized order of transfer and a notice of 1446
transfer and dismissal with the clerk of court and with the 1447
court or board to which the case was transferred. In any action 1448
transferred to a county board of revision, the prosecuting 1449
attorney or designated counsel hired by the prosecuting attorney 1450
shall serve the notice of transfer upon all parties to the 1451
action except any party that previously failed to answer, plea, 1452
or appear in the proceeding as required in Civil Rule 12. In any 1453
action transferred to a court, the prosecuting attorney or 1454
designated counsel hired by the prosecuting attorney shall serve 1455
the notice of transfer upon all parties to the action except 1456

H. B. No. 86 Page 50
As Passed by the House
those parties deemed to be in default under division (D) of 1457
section 323.69 of the Revised Code. 1458
(C) Upon journalization of the order of transfer, the 1459
clerk of court shall proceed as if the transferred complaint had 1460
been filed with the court or board to which the proceeding was 1461
transferred, except that the clerk is not required to perfect a 1462
notice of summons and complaint to any party that had already 1463
been served such notice. When the prosecuting attorney or 1464
designated counsel hired by the prosecuting attorney files the 1465
notice of transfer as prescribed in division (B) of this 1466
section, the clerk shall stamp or otherwise indicate on the 1467
notice a new case number for the proceeding. The clerk shall 1468
assign the entire case file to the court or board to which the 1469
proceeding was transferred, including any preliminary or final 1470
reports, documents, or other evidence made available to the 1471
transferring court or board. All such reports, documents, and 1472
other evidence shall be received by the court or board to which 1473
the proceeding was transferred as competent evidence for the 1474
purposes of adjudicating the proceeding. That court or board 1475
shall accept all such reports, documents, and evidence in the 1476
case file unless otherwise required by law or unless the court 1477
or board determines that doing so would not be in the interests 1478
of justice. 1479
The court or board to which the proceeding is transferred 1480
shall serve notice of the summons and the complaint as required 1481
in Civil Rule 4 or section 323.69 of the Revised Code, as 1482
applicable, upon any parties not yet served such notice in the 1483
proceeding. 1484
(D) If a county prosecuting attorney or designated counsel 1485
hired by the prosecuting attorney does not file a notice of 1486

H. B. No. 86 Page 51
As Passed by the House
transfer as required under division (B) of this section on or 1487
before the twenty-eighth day after the journalization of an 1488
order of transfer issued under division (A) of this section, or 1489
upon the motion of the prosecuting attorney, court, or board 1490
before that date, the complaint that is the subject of the order 1491
of transfer shall be deemed to have been may be dismissed 1492
without prejudice by both the court and the board of revision. 1493
(E) Upon the journalization of an order of transfer issued 1494
under division (A) of this section, the case shall be deemed to 1495
have been dismissed without prejudice by the transferring court 1496
or board. 1497
Sec. 323.70. (A) Subject to this section and to sections 1498
323.71 and 323.72 of the Revised Code, a county board of 1499
revision shall conduct a final hearing on the merits of a 1500
complaint filed under section 323.69 of the Revised Code, 1501
including the validity or amount of any impositions alleged in 1502
the complaint, not sooner than thirty days after the service of 1503
notice of summons and complaint has been perfected. If, after a 1504
hearing, the board finds that the validity or amount of all or a 1505
portion of the impositions is not supported by a preponderance 1506
of the evidence, the board may order the county auditor to 1507
remove from the tax list and duplicate amounts the board finds 1508
invalid or not supported by a preponderance of the evidence. The 1509
auditor shall remove all such amounts from the tax list and 1510
duplicate as ordered by the board of revision, including any 1511
impositions asserted under sections 715.26 and 715.261 of the 1512
Revised Code. 1513
(B) If, on or before the fourteenth day after service of 1514
process is perfected under division (B) of section 323.69 of the 1515
Revised Code, a record owner files with the clerk of court a 1516

H. B. No. 86 Page 52
As Passed by the House
motion requesting that the county board of revision order the 1517
case to be transferred to a court pursuant to section 323.691 of 1518
the Revised Code, the board shall, without conducting a hearing 1519
on the matter, promptly transfer the case for foreclosure of 1520
that land to a court pursuant to section 323.691 of the Revised 1521
Code to be conducted in accordance with the applicable laws. 1522
(C) A county board of revision, in accordance with rule 45 1523
of the Rules of Civil Procedure, may issue subpoenas compelling 1524
the attendance of witnesses and the production of papers, books, 1525
accounts, and testimony as necessary to conduct a hearing under 1526
this section or to otherwise adjudicate a case under sections 1527
323.65 to 323.79 of the Revised Code. 1528
Sec. 323.71. (A)(1) (A) If the county board of revision, 1529
upon its own motion or pursuant to a hearing under division (A) 1530
(2) (B) of this section, determines that the impositions against 1531
a parcel of abandoned land that is the subject of a complaint 1532
filed under section 323.69 of the Revised Code exceed the fair 1533
market appraised value of that parcel for taxation purposes as 1534
currently shown by the latest valuation by the auditor of the 1535
county in which the land is located, then the board may proceed 1536
to hear and adjudicate the case as provided under sections 1537
323.70 and 323.72 of the Revised Code. Upon entry of an order of 1538
foreclosure, the parcel may be disposed of as prescribed by 1539
division (G) of section 323.73 of the Revised Code. 1540
If the board of revision, upon its own motion or pursuant 1541
to a hearing under division (A)(2) (B) of this section, 1542
determines that the impositions against a parcel do not exceed 1543
the fair market appraised value of the parcel for taxation 1544
purposes as shown by the county auditor's then-current valuation 1545
of the parcel or the actual fair market value of the parcel as 1546

H. B. No. 86 Page 53
As Passed by the House
established in division (B) of this section, the parcel shall 1547
not be disposed of as prescribed by division (G) of section 1548
323.73 of the Revised Code, but may be disposed of as otherwise 1549
provided in section 323.73, 323.74, 323.75, 323.77, or 323.78 of 1550
the Revised Code. 1551
(2) (B) By a motion filed not later than seven days before 1552
a final hearing on a complaint is held under section 323.70 of 1553
the Revised Code, and notwithstanding division (A)(1) of section 1554
323.72 of the Revised Code, an owner or lienholder may file with 1555
the county board of revision a good faith appraisal of the 1556
parcel from a licensed professional appraiser and request a 1557
hearing to determine whether the impositions against the parcel 1558
of abandoned land exceed or do not exceed the actual fair market 1559
value of that parcel as shown by the auditor's then-current 1560
valuation of that parcel. If the motion is timely filed, the 1561
board of revision shall conduct a hearing and shall make a 1562
factual finding as to whether the impositions against the parcel 1563
exceed or do not exceed the actual fair market value of that 1564
parcel as shown by the auditor's then-current valuation of that 1565
parcel. An owner or lienholder must show by a preponderance of 1566
the evidence that the impositions against the parcel do not 1567
exceed the auditor's then-current valuation actual fair market 1568
value of the parcel in order to preclude the application of 1569
division (G) of section 323.73 of the Revised Code. 1570
(B) Notwithstanding sections 323.65 to 323.79 of the 1571
Revised Code to the contrary, for purposes of determining in any 1572
proceeding under those sections whether the total of the 1573
impositions against the abandoned land exceed the fair market 1574
value of the abandoned land, it is prima-facie evidence and a 1575
rebuttable presumption that may be rebutted to the county board 1576
of revision that the auditor's then-current valuation of that 1577

H. B. No. 86 Page 54
As Passed by the House
abandoned land is the fair market value of the land, regardless 1578
of whether an independent appraisal has been 1579
performed.Notwithstanding such determination, the board of 1580
revision may order the parcel disposed of pursuant to section 1581
323.78 of the Revised Code. 1582
Sec. 323.72. (A)(1) At any time after a complaint is filed 1583
under section 323.69 of the Revised Code, and before a decree of 1584
foreclosure is entered, the record owner or another person 1585
having a legal or equitable ownership interest in the abandoned 1586
land may plead only that the impositions shown by the notice to 1587
be due and outstanding have been paid in full or are invalid or 1588
inapplicable in whole or in part, and may raise issues 1589
pertaining to service of process and the parcel's status as 1590
abandoned land. 1591
(2) At any time before a decree of foreclosure is filed 1592
under section 323.69 of the Revised Code, a lienholder or 1593
another person having a security interest of record in the 1594
abandoned land may plead either of the following: 1595
(a) That the impositions shown by the notice to be due and 1596
outstanding have been paid in full; 1597
(b) Subject to division (C) of this section, that in order 1598
to preserve the lienholder's or other person's security interest 1599
of record in the land, the abandoned land should not be disposed 1600
of as provided in sections 323.65 to 323.79 of the Revised Code 1601
and the case should be transferred to a court pursuant to 1602
section 323.691 of the Revised Code. 1603
(B) If the record owner or another person having a legal 1604
or equitable ownership interest in a parcel of abandoned land 1605
files a pleading with the county board of revision under 1606

H. B. No. 86 Page 55
As Passed by the House
division (A)(1) of this section, or if a lienholder or another 1607
person having a security interest of record in the abandoned 1608
land files a pleading with the board under division (A)(2) of 1609
this section that asserts that the impositions have been paid in 1610
full, the board shall schedule a hearing for a date not sooner 1611
than thirty days, and not later than ninety days, after the 1612
board receives the pleading. Upon scheduling the hearing, the 1613
board shall notify the person that filed the pleading and all 1614
interested parties, other than parties in default, of the date, 1615
time, and place of the hearing, and shall conduct the hearing. 1616
The only questions to be considered at the hearing are the 1617
amount and validity of all or a portion of the impositions, 1618
whether those impositions have in fact been paid in full, and, 1619
under division (A)(1) of this section, whether valid issues 1620
pertaining to service of process and the parcel's status as 1621
abandoned land have been raised. If the record owner, 1622
lienholder, or other person shows by a preponderance of the 1623
evidence that all impositions against the parcel have been paid, 1624
the board shall dismiss the complaint and remove the parcel of 1625
abandoned land from the abandoned land list, and that land shall 1626
not be offered for sale or otherwise conveyed under sections 1627
323.65 to 323.79 of the Revised Code. If the record owner, 1628
lienholder, or other person fails to appear, or appears and 1629
fails to show by a preponderance of the evidence that all 1630
impositions against the parcel have been paid, the board shall 1631
proceed in the manner prescribed in section 323.73with the final 1632
hearing as prescribed in section 323.70 of the Revised Code. A 1633
hearing under this division may be consolidated with any final 1634
hearing on the matter under that section 323.70 of the Revised 1635
Code. 1636
If the board determines that the impositions have been 1637

paid, then the board, on its own motion, may dismiss the case 1638
without a hearing. If the board determines, based upon a 1639
preponderance of evidence provided by the parties, that the 1640
parcel is not abandoned land, then the board shall, upon its own 1641
motion, order the case transferred to a court pursuant to 1642
section 323.691 of the Revised Code. 1643
(C) If a lienholder or another person having a security 1644
interest of record in the abandoned land, other than the owner, 1645
timely files a pleading under division (A)(2)(b) of this section 1646
requesting that the abandoned land not be disposed of as 1647
provided in sections 323.65 to 323.79 of the Revised Code and 1648

323.691 of the Revised Code in order to preserve the 1650
lienholder's or other person's security interest, the county 1651
board of revision may approve the request if the board finds 1652
that the sale or other conveyance of the parcel of land under 1653
sections 323.65 to 323.79 of the Revised Code would unreasonably 1654
jeopardize the lienholder's or other person's ability to enforce 1655
the security interest or to otherwise preserve the lienholder's 1656
or other person's security interest. The board may conduct a 1657
hearing on the request and make a ruling based on the available 1658
and submitted evidence of the parties. If the board approves the 1659
request without a hearing, the board shall file the decision 1660
with the clerk of court, and the clerk shall send a notice of 1661
the decision to the lienholder or other person by ordinary mail. 1662

of abandoned land should not be disposed of pursuant to sections 1665
323.65 to 323.78 323.79 of the Revised Code and the complaint 1666
should be transferred to a court pursuant to section 323.691 of 1667

first make a minimum showing by a preponderance of the evidence 1670
pursuant to section 323.71 of the Revised Code that the 1671
impositions against the parcel of abandoned land do not exceed 1672
the actual fair market value of the abandoned land as determined 1673
by the auditor's then-current valuation of that parcel, which 1674
valuation is presumed, subject to rebuttal, to be the fair 1675
market value of the land. If the lienholder or other person 1676
having a security interest makes the minimum showing, the board 1677
of revision may consider the request and make a ruling based on 1678
the available and submitted evidence of the parties. If the 1679
lienholder or other person having a security interest fails to 1680
make the minimum showing, the board of revision shall deny the 1681
request. 1682
(D) If a pleading as described in division (B) or (C) of 1683
this section is filed and the county board of revision approves 1684
a request made under those divisions, regardless of whether a 1685
hearing is conducted under division (C) of this section, the 1686

future public auction for five years from the date of the 1775
bidder's default. 1776
Notwithstanding section 321.261 of the Revised Code, with 1777
respect to any proceedings initiated pursuant to sections 323.65 1778

placed on the tax list and duplicate showing the amount of the 2456
lien ascribed specifically to the agent's total costs. The agent 2457
has standing to pursue a separate cause of action for money 2458
damages to satisfy the lien or pursue a foreclosure action in a 2459
court of competent jurisdiction or with the board of revision to 2460
enforce the lien without regard to occupancy. For purposes of a 2461
foreclosure proceeding by the county treasurer for delinquent 2462
taxes, this division does not affect the lien priority as 2463
between a county land reutilization corporation and the county 2464
treasurer, but the corporation's lien is superior to the lien of 2465
any other lienholder of the property. As to a direct action by a 2466
county land reutilization corporation, the lien for the taxes, 2467
assessment, charges, costs, penalties, and interest on the tax 2468
list and duplicate is in all cases superior to the lien of a 2469
county land reutilization corporation, whose lien for total 2470
costs shall be next in priority as against all other interests, 2471
except as provided in division (G) of this section. 2472
(G) A county land reutilization corporation acting as an 2473
agent of a municipal corporation under an agreement under 2474
pursuant to division (E) of this section may, with the county 2475
treasurer's consent, petition the court or board of revision 2476
with jurisdiction over an action undertaken under division (F) 2477
(B)(3) of this section pleading that the lien of the 2478
corporation, as agent, for the total costs shall be superior to 2479
the lien for the taxes, assessments, charges, costs, penalties, 2480

H. B. No. 86 Page 84
As Passed by the House
and interest. If the court or board of revision determines that 2481
the lien is for total costs paid or incurred by the corporation 2482
as such an agent, and that subordinating the lien for such taxes 2483
and other impositions to the lien of the corporation promotes 2484
the expeditious abatement of public nuisances, the court or 2485
board may order the lien for the taxes and other impositions to 2486
be subordinate to the corporation's lien. The court or board may 2487
not subordinate the lien for taxes and other such impositions to 2488
any other liens. 2489
(H) When a parcel of land upon which a lien has been 2490
placed under division (B)(1) or (3) of this section is 2491
transferred to a county land reutilization corporation, the lien 2492
on the parcel shall be extinguished if the lien is for costs or 2493
charges that were incurred related to an abatement activity that 2494
occurred before the date of the transfer to the corporation and 2495
if the corporation did not incur the costs or charges, 2496
regardless of whether the lien was attached or the costs or 2497
charges were certified before the date of transfer. In such a 2498
case, the county land reutilization corporation and its 2499
successors in title shall take title to the property free and 2500
clear of any such lien and shall be immune from liability in any 2501
action to collect such costs or charges. 2502
If a county land reutilization corporation takes title to 2503
property before any costs or charges have been certified or any 2504
lien has been placed with respect to the property under division 2505
(B)(1) or (3) of this section, the corporation shall be deemed a 2506
bona fide purchaser for value without knowledge of such costs or 2507
lien, regardless of whether the corporation had actual or 2508
constructive knowledge of the costs or lien, and any such lien 2509
shall be void and unenforceable against the corporation and its 2510
successors in title. 2511

they are situated, and any burial ground that has been used as 2535
such for fifteen years are exempt from sale on execution on a 2536
judgment, dower, and compulsory partition; but land appropriated 2537
and set apart as a private burial ground is not so exempt if it 2538
exceeds in value the sum of fifty dollars. 2539

division (B)(1) of this section finds at the hearing required by 4218
division (B)(2) of this section that the building involved is a 4219

owner of the building previously has not been afforded a 4221
reasonable opportunity to abate the public nuisance or has been 4222
afforded such an opportunity and has not refused or failed to 4223
abate the public nuisance, and if the complaint of the municipal 4224
corporation, township, community improvement corporation, 4225
neighbor, tenant, or nonprofit corporation commencing the action 4226
requested the issuance of an injunction as described in this 4227
division, then the judge may issue an injunction requiring the 4228

issued pursuant to this division, the owner of the building 4232
involved shall be given no more than thirty days from the date 4233

(B)(1) of this section finds at the hearing required by division 4238
(B)(2) of this section that the building involved is a public 4239
nuisance, if the judge additionally determines that the owner of 4240
the building previously has been afforded a reasonable 4241
opportunity to abate the public nuisance and has refused or 4242
failed to do so, and if the complaint of the municipal 4243
corporation, township, community improvement corporation, 4244
neighbor, tenant, or nonprofit corporation commencing the action 4245
requested relief as described in this division, then the judge 4246
shall offer any mortgagee, lienholder, or other interested party 4247
associated with the property on which the building is located, 4248
in the order of the priority of interest in title, the 4249
opportunity to undertake the work and to furnish the materials 4250
necessary to abate the public nuisance. Prior to selecting any 4251
interested party, the judge shall require the interested party 4252
to demonstrate the ability to promptly undertake the work and 4253
furnish the materials required, to provide the judge with a 4254
viable financial and construction plan for the rehabilitation of 4255
the building as described in division (D) of this section, and 4256
to post security for the performance of the work and the 4257
furnishing of the materials. 4258

if the judge determines, at any time after the hearing, that any 4262
party who is undertaking corrective work pursuant to this 4263
division cannot or will not proceed, or has not proceeded with 4264
due diligence, the judge may appoint a receiver pursuant to 4265
division (C)(3) of this section to take possession and control 4266
of the building. 4267
(3)(a) The judge in a civil action described in division 4268

the building involved as described in division (D) of this 4272
section and has demonstrated the capacity and expertise to 4273

of the net earnings of a nonprofit corporation shall inure to 4286

a receiver does not constitute the holding of a public office or 4289
employment within the meaning of sections 731.02 and 731.12 or 4290
any other section of the Revised Code and does not constitute a 4291

money by any municipal corporation. A member of a board of 4293
trustees of a nonprofit corporation appointed as a receiver 4294
shall not be disqualified from holding any public office or 4295
employment, and shall not forfeit any public office or 4296
employment, by reason of membership on the board of trustees, 4297
notwithstanding any law to the contrary. 4298

construction plan for the rehabilitation of the building 4303
involved and, if it specifies all of the following, shall 4304
approve that plan: 4305

other development costs that are required to abate the public 4307
nuisance; 4308

the property on which it is located after the furnishing of the 4310

H. B. No. 86 Page 157
As Passed by the House
constitute a public nuisance demolished because repair and 4321
rehabilitation of the building are found not to be feasible, the 4322
judge may order the demolition. However, the demolition shall 4323
not be ordered unless the requesting interested parties have 4324
paid the costs of demolition and, if any, of the receivership, 4325
and, if any, all notes, certificates, mortgages, and fees of the 4326
receivership. 4327

the evidence, that the benefits of not selling the building and 4467

H. B. No. 86 Page 162

the property outweigh the benefits of selling them. The 4468
objecting person must satisfy all liens created under division 4469
(H) of this section in order to sustain the person's burden of 4470
proof. If the judge determines that there is no objecting 4471
person, or if the judge determines that there is one or more 4472

specify. 4477
(b) In any sale of subsidized housing that is ordered 4478
pursuant to this section, the judge shall specify that the 4479

the department of housing and urban development or the rural 4484
housing service of the federal department of agriculture under 4485
which the property continues to be subsidized housing and the 4486
owner continues to operate that property as subsidized housing 4487
unless the secretary of housing and urban development or the 4488
administrator of the rural housing service terminates that 4489
property's contract prior to or upon the conveyance of the 4490
property. 4491
(3) If a sale of a building and the property on which it 4492
is located is ordered pursuant to divisions (I)(1) and (2) of 4493
this section and if the sale occurs in accordance with the terms 4494
and conditions specified by the judge in the judge's order of 4495
sale, then the receiver shall distribute the proceeds of the 4496
sale and the balance of any funds that the receiver may possess, 4497

of this section is insufficient to pay the entire amount of 4520
those taxes, assessments, charges, penalties, and interest, the 4521

section, and if the judge approves any final accounting required 4538
of the receiver, the judge may terminate the receivership. 4539

was transferred to a qualified low-income family, the affidavit 4766
shall identify the transferee by name. If the organization 4767
transfers title to the property to anyone other than a qualified 4768
low-income family, the exemption, if it has not previously 4769

expired, shall terminate, and the property shall be restored to 4770
the tax list for the year following the year of the transfer and 4771
a charge shall be levied against the property in an amount equal 4772
to the amount of additional taxes that would have been levied if 4773
such property had not been exempt from taxation. The charge 4774
constitutes a lien of the state upon such property as of the 4775
first day of January of the tax year in which the charge is 4776
levied and continues until discharged as provided by law. 4777
The application for exemption shall be filed as otherwise 4778
required under section 5715.27 of the Revised Code, except that 4779
the organization holding the property shall file with its 4780
application documentation substantiating its status as an 4781
organization organized and operated exclusively for charitable 4782
purposes under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code 4783
and its qualification for exemption from federal taxation under 4784
section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and affirming its 4785
intention to construct or rehabilitate the property for the 4786
eventual transfer to qualified low-income families. 4787
As used in this division, "qualified low-income family" 4788
means a family whose income does not exceed two hundred per cent 4789
of the official federal poverty guidelines as revised annually 4790
in accordance with section 673(2) of the "Omnibus Budget 4791
Reconciliation Act of 1981," 95 Stat. 511, 42 U.S.C.A. 9902, as 4792
amended, for a family size equal to the size of the family whose 4793
income is being determined. 4794
(2) Real property constituting a retail store, including 4795
the land on which the retail store is located, that is owned and 4796
operated by an organization described in division (E)(1) of this 4797
section shall be exempt from taxation if the retail store sells 4798
primarily donated items suitable for residential housing 4799

purposes and if the proceeds of such sales are used solely for 4800
the purposes of the organization. 4801
(F)(1) Real property that is acquired and held by a county 4802
land reutilization corporation organized under Chapter 1724. of 4803
the Revised Code and that is not otherwise exempt from taxation 4804
under Chapter 5722. of the Revised Code shall be deemed real 4805
property used for a public purpose and shall be exempt from 4806
taxation until sold or transferred by the corporation. 4807
Notwithstanding section 5715.27 of the Revised Code, a county 4808
land reutilization corporation is not required to apply to any 4809
county or state agency in order to qualify for the exemption. 4810
(2) Real property that is acquired and held by an electing 4811
subdivision other than a county land reutilization corporation 4812
on or after April 9, 2009, for the public purpose of 4813
implementing an effective land reutilization program or for a 4814
related public purpose, and that is not otherwise exempt from 4815
taxation under Chapter 5722. of the Revised Code, shall be 4816
exempt from taxation until sold or transferred by the electing 4817
subdivision. Notwithstanding section 5715.27 of the Revised 4818
Code, an electing subdivision other than a county land 4819
reutilization corporation is not required to apply to any county 4820
or state agency in order to qualify for an exemption with 4821
respect to property acquired or held for such purposes on or 4822
after such date, regardless of how the electing subdivision 4823
acquires the property, if the instrument transferring title to 4824
the electing subdivision states that the property is being 4825
acquired by the electing subdivision as part of its land 4826
reutilization program. 4827
As used in this section, "electing subdivision" and "land 4828
reutilization program" have the same meanings as in section 4829

H. B. No. 86 Page 174
As Passed by the House
5722.01 of the Revised Code, and "county land reutilization 4830
corporation" means a county land reutilization corporation 4831
organized under Chapter 1724. of the Revised Code and any 4832
subsidiary wholly owned by such a county land reutilization 4833
corporation that is identified as "a wholly owned subsidiary of 4834
a county land reutilization corporation" in the deed of 4835
conveyance transferring title to the subsidiary. 4836
In lieu of the application for exemption otherwise 4837
required to be filed as required under section 5715.27 of the 4838
Revised Code, a county land reutilization corporation holding 4839
the property shall, upon the request of any county or state 4840
agency, submit its articles of incorporation substantiating its 4841
status as a county land reutilization corporation. 4842
(3) An exemption authorized under division (F)(1) or (2) 4843
of this section shall commence on the day the title to the 4844
property is transferred to the county land reutilization 4845
corporation or electing subdivision and shall continue while 4846
title is held by the corporation or subdivision. The exemption 4847
shall end on the last day of the tax year in which title is 4848
transferred from the corporation or subdivision to an owner 4849
whose use of the property does not qualify for an exemption 4850
pursuant to division (F)(1) or (2) of this section. If the title 4851
to the property is transferred to the corporation and from the 4852
corporation, or to the subdivision and from the subdivision, in 4853
the same tax year, the exemption shall continue to the end of 4854
that tax year. Upon the commencement of an exemption authorized 4855
under division (F)(1) or (2) of this section, the entire amount 4856
of taxes that are a lien but not yet determined, assessed, and 4857
levied for the tax year in which title is transferred to the 4858
corporation or subdivision shall be remitted by the county 4859
auditor. 4860

(G) Real property that is owned by an organization 4861
described under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code 4862
and exempt from federal income taxation under section 501(a) of 4863
the Internal Revenue Code and that is used by that organization 4864
exclusively for receiving, processing, or distributing human 4865
blood, tissues, eyes, or organs or for research and development 4866
thereof shall be exempt from taxation. 4867
(H) Real property that is owned by an organization 4868
described under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code 4869
and exempt from federal income taxation under section 501(a) of 4870
the Internal Revenue Code and that received a loan from the 4871
federal small business administration as a participating 4872
intermediary in the federal microloan program under 15 U.S.C. 4873
636(m) shall be exempt from taxation if the property is used by 4874
that organization primarily for small business lending, economic 4875
development, job training, entrepreneur education, or associated 4876
administrative purposes as such a participating intermediary. 4877
Sec. 5709.58. (A) A board of county commissioners may 4878
adopt a resolution declaring a portion, not exceeding fifty per 4879
cent, of the value of each parcel of real property conveyed by a 4880
county land reutilization corporation exempt from real property 4881
taxation for a term not exceeding five years, beginning with the 4882
first full tax year after the property is conveyed. 4883
The resolution shall both: 4884
(1) Specify the percentage of the real property's value to 4885
be exempted and the term of the exemption; 4886
(2) Require the owner of the real property exempted from 4887
taxation to make annual service payments in lieu of taxes to the 4888
county treasurer on or before the final dates for payment of 4889

H. B. No. 86 Page 176
As Passed by the House
real property taxes. 4890
(B) Service payments in lieu of taxes required by a 4891
resolution adopted under this section shall be charged and 4892
collected in the same manner and in the same amount as the real 4893
property taxes that would have been charged and payable against 4894
the exempted portion of the real property if not for the 4895
exemption. 4896
Service payment receipts shall be distributed at the same 4897
time and in the same manner as real property tax payments. The 4898
entire amount, however, shall be paid to the county land 4899
reutilization corporation that conveyed the real property. 4900
(C) An exemption from taxation under this section 4901
commences with the first full tax year after the real property 4902
is conveyed by the county land reutilization corporation, or the 4903
first tax year that ends after the effective date of the 4904
resolution adopted by the board of county commissioners under 4905
division (A) of this section, whichever is later. The exemption 4906
ends at the end of the term specified in the resolution, which 4907
shall be not later than the end of the fifth full tax year 4908
following the conveyance. 4909
(D) A county land reutilization corporation may request, 4910
in writing, that the board of county commissioners rescind a 4911
resolution adopted under division (A) of this section. Upon 4912
receipt of that request, the board of county commissioners 4913
shall, by resolution adopted within sixty days after receiving 4914
that request, rescind the resolution adopted under division (A) 4915
of this section. The rescinding resolution shall specify whether 4916
the rescission applies only to real property conveyed after the 4917
effective date of the rescinding resolution or if it also 4918
rescinds previously granted exemptions. No exemption granted 4919

H. B. No. 86 Page 177
As Passed by the House
under this section shall be rescinded before the end of the tax 4920
year that includes the effective date of the rescinding 4921
resolution. 4922
A board of county commissioners that adopts a resolution 4923
rescinding tax exemptions under this division shall, at the time 4924
the resolution is adopted, notify the county auditor of the 4925
rescission. If the rescission applies to previously granted 4926
exemptions, such notice shall identify the previously exempted 4927
parcels and specify the last tax year to which the exemption 4928
applies. 4929
No property owner shall be required to make service 4930
payments under division (B) of this section for any tax year for 4931
which a tax exemption is rescinded under this division. 4932
Sec. 5709.91. (A) Service payments in lieu of taxes 4933
required under sections 725.04, 5709.42, 5709.46, 5709.58, 4934
5709.74, and 5709.79 of the Revised Code, minimum service 4935
payment obligations, and service charges in lieu of taxes 4936
required under sections 1728.11 and 1728.111 of the Revised Code 4937
shall be treated in the same manner as taxes, as defined in 4938
section 323.01 of the Revised Code, for all purposes of the lien 4939
described in section 323.11 of the Revised Code, including, but 4940
not limited to, the priority and enforcement of the lien and the 4941
collection of the service payments, minimum service payment 4942
obligations, or service charges secured by the lien. 4943
(B) Any covenant or agreement in an instrument whereby a 4944
property owner agrees to a minimum service payment obligation 4945
shall be a covenant running with the land. Upon the proper 4946
recording of the instrument with the county recorder, the 4947
covenant is fully binding on behalf of and enforceable by the 4948
county, township, or municipal corporation against the property 4949

H. B. No. 86 Page 178
As Passed by the House
owner and any person acquiring an interest in the land and all 4950
successors and assigns. If any such minimum service payment 4951
obligation becomes delinquent according to such covenant or 4952
agreement, the county, township, or municipal corporation may 4953
enforce the delinquent minimum service payment obligation in the 4954
manner provided under division (A) of this section or in the 4955
manner otherwise provided in the instrument. A minimum service 4956
payment obligation is an insurable interest with respect to 4957
title insurance under Chapter 3953. of the Revised Code. 4958
(C) A county, township, or municipal corporation may 4959
certify a minimum service payment obligation that is a covenant 4960
under division (B) of this section to the county auditor, who 4961
shall enter the obligation on the tax list of real property 4962
opposite the parcel against which it is charged, and certify the 4963
minimum service payment obligation to the county treasurer. An 4964
unpaid minimum service payment obligation is a lien on property 4965
against which it is charged from the date the obligation is 4966
entered on the tax list, and shall be collected in the manner 4967
provided for collection of real property taxes. Once the minimum 4968
service payment obligation is collected, it shall be paid 4969
immediately to the county, township, or municipal corporation. 4970
(D) For the purposes of this section, a "minimum service 4971
payment obligation" is an obligation, including a contingent 4972
obligation, for a property owner to make a payment to a county, 4973
township, or municipal corporation pursuant to an agreement 4974
between the property owner and the county, township, or 4975
municipal corporation to ensure sufficient funds to finance the 4976
expenditures authorized under sections 725.04, 1728.11, 4977
1728.111, 5709.40 to 5709.43, 5709.45 to 5709.47, 5709.73 to 4978
5709.75, or 5709.77 to 5709.81 of the Revised Code. "Minimum 4979
service payment obligation" does not include service payments in 4980

lieu of taxes required under section 1728.11 or 1728.111 of the 4983
Revised Code. 4984
Sec. 5709.911. (A)(1) A municipal corporation, township, 4985
or county that has enacted an ordinance or resolution under 4986
section 5709.40, 5709.41, 5709.45, 5709.58, 5709.73, or 5709.78 4987
of the Revised Code or that has entered into an agreement 4988
referred to in section 725.02 or 1728.07 of the Revised Code may 4989
file an application for exemption under those sections in the 4990
same manner as other real property tax exemptions, 4991
notwithstanding the indication in division (A) of section 4992
5715.27 of the Revised Code that the owner of the property may 4993
file the application. An application for exemption may not be 4994
filed by a municipal corporation, township, or county for an 4995
exemption of a parcel under section 5709.40, 5709.73, or 5709.78 4996
of the Revised Code if the property owner excludes the property 4997
from such exemption as provided in that section. 4998
(2) Except as provided in division (B) of this section, if 4999
the application for exemption under section 725.02, 1728.10, 5000
5709.40, 5709.41, 5709.45, 5709.58, 5709.73, or 5709.78 of the 5001
Revised Code is filed by a municipal corporation, township, or 5002
county and more than one real property tax exemption applies by 5003
law to the property or a portion of the property, both of the 5004
following apply: 5005
(a) An exemption granted under section 725.02, 1728.10, 5006
5709.40, 5709.41, 5709.45, 5709.58, 5709.73, or 5709.78 of the 5007
Revised Code shall be subordinate to an exemption with respect 5008
to the property or portion of the property granted under any 5009
other provision of the Revised Code. 5010

H. B. No. 86 Page 180
As Passed by the House
(b) Neither service payments in lieu of taxes under 5011
section 725.04, 5709.42, 5709.46, 5709.58, 5709.74, or 5709.79 5012
of the Revised Code, nor service charges in lieu of taxes under 5013
section 1728.11 or 1728.111 of the Revised Code, shall be 5014
required with respect to the property or portion of the property 5015
that is exempt from real property taxes under that other 5016
provision of the Revised Code during the effective period of the 5017
exemption. 5018
(B)(1) If the application for exemption under section 5019
725.02, 1728.10, 5709.40, 5709.41, 5709.45, 5709.58, 5709.73, or 5020
5709.78 of the Revised Code is filed by the owner of the 5021
property or by a municipal corporation, township, or county with 5022
the owner's written consent attached to the application, and if 5023
more than one real property tax exemption applies by law to the 5024
property or a portion of the property, no other exemption shall 5025
be granted for the portion of the property already exempt under 5026
section 725.02, 1728.10, 5709.40, 5709.41, 5709.45, 5709.58, 5027
5709.73, or 5709.78 of the Revised Code unless the municipal 5028
corporation, township, or county that enacted the authorizing 5029
ordinance or resolution for the earlier exemption provides its 5030
duly authorized written consent to the subsequent exemption by 5031
means of a duly enacted ordinance or resolution. 5032
(2) If the application for exemption under section 725.02, 5033
1728.10, 5709.40, 5709.41, 5709.45, 5709.58, 5709.73, or 5709.78 5034
of the Revised Code is filed by a municipal corporation, 5035
township, or county and approved by the tax commissioner, if the 5036
owner of the property subsequently provides written consent to 5037
the exemption and the consent is filed with the tax 5038
commissioner, and if more than one real property tax exemption 5039
applies by law to the property or a portion of the property, no 5040
other exemption shall be granted for the portion of the property 5041

H. B. No. 86 Page 181
As Passed by the House
already exempt under section 725.02, 1728.10, 5709.40, 5709.41, 5042
5709.45, 5709.58, 5709.73, or 5709.78 of the Revised Code unless 5043
the municipal corporation, township, or county that enacted the 5044
authorizing ordinance or resolution for the earlier exemption 5045
provides its duly authorized written consent to the subsequent 5046
exemption by means of a duly enacted ordinance or resolution. 5047
(C) After the tax commissioner has approved or partially 5048
approved an application for exemption filed by or with the 5049
consent of a property owner under the circumstances described in 5050
division (B)(1) of this section or if a property owner 5051
subsequently provides written consent to an exemption under the 5052
circumstances described in division (B)(2) of this section, the 5053
municipal corporation, township, county, or property owner shall 5054
file one of the following with the county recorder for the 5055
county in which the property is located: 5056
(1) A notice that clearly identifies the property and the 5057
owner of the property and states that the property, regardless 5058
of future use or ownership, remains liable for any service 5059
payments or service charges required by the exemption until the 5060
terms of the exemption have been satisfied, unless the municipal 5061
corporation, township, or county consents to the subsequent 5062
exemption and relinquishes its right to collect the service 5063
payments or service charges as provided in division (B)(1) or 5064
(2) of this section, as applicable; 5065
(2) An agreement, declaration, or covenant by which the 5066
owner of the property subject to the exemption binds the owner 5067
and the property, regardless of future use or ownership, to the 5068
obligation to make service payments or service charges in lieu 5069
of taxes as required by the exemption until the terms of the 5070
exemption have been satisfied, unless the municipal corporation, 5071

H. B. No. 86 Page 182
As Passed by the House
township, or county consents to the subsequent exemption and 5072
relinquishes its right to collect the service payments or 5073
service charges as provided in division (B)(1) or (2) of this 5074
section, as applicable. 5075
The county recorder's office shall charge a fee of 5076
fourteen dollars to record the notice, agreement, declaration, 5077
or covenant, the proceeds of which shall be retained by the 5078
county. 5079
(D) Upon filing of the notice, agreement, declaration, or 5080
covenant with the county recorder, the provisions of division 5081
(B) of this section are binding on all future owners of the 5082
property or portion of the property, regardless of how the 5083
property is used. Failure to file a notice, agreement, 5084
declaration, or covenant with the county recorder relieves 5085
future owners of the property from the obligation to make 5086
service payments in lieu of taxes under section 725.04, 5709.42, 5087
5709.46, 5709.58, 5709.74, or 5709.79 of the Revised Code or 5088
service charges in lieu of taxes under section 1728.11 or 5089
1728.111 of the Revised Code, if the property or a portion of 5090
the property later qualifies for exemption under any other 5091
provision of the Revised Code. Failure to file a notice, 5092
agreement, declaration, or covenant does not, however, relieve 5093
the owner of the property, at the time the application for 5094
exemption is filed, from making those payments or charges. 5095
Sec. 5713.083. (A) The owner of property appearing on the 5096
exempt list shall notify the county auditor, on a form 5097
prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the property ceases to 5098
qualify for exemption, except for an exemption authorized under 5099
section 5709.58 of the Revised Code. The notification shall be 5100
filed with the county auditor on or before the last day of the 5101

H. B. No. 86 Page 183
As Passed by the House
tax year for which the property ceases to qualify for exemption. 5102
Upon receipt of the notification, the county auditor shall 5103
return the property to the tax list. 5104
(B) If the county auditor discovers that an owner failed 5105
to properly notify the auditor as required under division (A) of 5106
this section, the auditor shall impose a charge against the 5107
property described in that division equal to the total amount by 5108
which taxes were reduced for any of the five preceding tax years 5109
that the auditor ascertains the property was not entitled to the 5110
exemption and was owned by the current owner. The auditor shall 5111
notify the owner, by ordinary mail, of the charge, the owner's 5112
right to appeal the charge, and the manner in which the owner 5113
may appeal the charge. The owner may appeal the imposition of 5114
the charge by filing an exemption application with the tax 5115
commissioner under section 5715.27 of the Revised Code. 5116
Notwithstanding division (A) of section 5713.081 of the Revised 5117
Code, if the tax commissioner determines that the property was 5118
entitled to an exemption for one or more tax years for which a 5119
charge was imposed under this division, the tax commissioner may 5120
order the charge to be removed for those years and may remit any 5121
taxes, penalties, and interest paid for those years in the 5122
manner prescribed by section 5715.22 of the Revised Code. The 5123
charge shall be collected in the same manner as other delinquent 5124
taxes. 5125
Sec. 5715.02. The county treasurer, county auditor, and a 5126
member of the board of county commissioners selected by the 5127
board of county commissioners shall constitute the county board 5128
of revision, or they may provide for one or more hearing boards 5129
when they deem the creation of such to be necessary to the 5130
expeditious hearing of valuation complaints. Each such official 5131
may appoint one qualified employee from the official's office to 5132

H. B. No. 86 Page 184
As Passed by the House
serve in the official's place and stead on each such board for 5133
the purpose of hearing complaints as to the value of real 5134
property only, each such hearing board has the same authority to 5135
hear and decide complaints and sign the journal as the board of 5136
revision, and shall proceed in the manner provided for the board 5137
of revision by sections 5715.08 to 5715.20 of the Revised Code. 5138
Any decision by a hearing board shall be the decision of the 5139
board of revision. 5140
A majority of a county board of revision or hearing board 5141
shall constitute a quorum to hear and determine any complaint, 5142
and any vacancy shall not impair the right of the remaining 5143
members of such board, whether elected officials or appointees, 5144
to exercise all the powers thereof so long as a majority 5145
remains. 5146
A member of the county board of revision who is also a 5147
member of the board of directors of a county land reutilization 5148

As Passed by the House
prosecuting attorney may institute a foreclosure proceeding in 5553
the name of the county treasurer, in any court with 5554
jurisdiction, to foreclose the lien of the state against such 5555
minerals or rights to minerals, unless the taxes, assessments, 5556
charges, penalties, and interest are paid prior to the time the 5557
complaint is filed, or unless a foreclosure or foreclosure and 5558
forfeiture action has been or will be instituted under section 5559
323.25, sections 323.65 to 323.79, or section 5721.14 of the 5560
Revised Code. 5561
Nothing in this section or section 5721.03 of the Revised 5562
Code prohibits the prosecuting attorney from instituting a 5563
proceeding under this section before the delinquent tax list or 5564
delinquent vacant land tax list that includes the parcel is 5565
published pursuant to division (B) of section 5721.03 of the 5566
Revised Code if the list is not published within the time 5567
prescribed by that division. The prosecuting attorney shall 5568
prosecute the proceeding to final judgment and satisfaction. 5569
Within ten days after obtaining a judgment, the prosecuting 5570
attorney shall notify the treasurer in writing that judgment has 5571
been rendered. If there is a copy of a written delinquent tax 5572
contract attached to the certificate or an asterisk next to an 5573
entry on the master list, or if a copy of a delinquent tax 5574
contract is received from the auditor prior to the commencement 5575
of the proceeding under this section, the prosecuting attorney 5576
shall not institute the proceeding under this section, unless 5577
the prosecuting attorney receives a certification of the 5578
treasurer that the delinquent tax contract has become void. 5579
(A) This division applies to all foreclosure proceedings 5580
not instituted and prosecuted under section 323.25 of the 5581
Revised Code or division (B) or (C) of this section. The 5582
foreclosure proceedings shall be instituted and prosecuted in 5583

H. B. No. 86 Page 199
As Passed by the House
the same manner as is provided by law for the foreclosure of 5584
mortgages on land, except that, if service by publication is 5585
necessary, such publication, instead of as provided by the Rules 5586
of Civil Procedure, shall either be made (1) once a week for 5587
three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in 5588
the county or (2) once in a newspaper of general circulation in 5589
the county and, beginning one week thereafter, on a web site of 5590
the county or of the court, as selected by the clerk of the 5591
court. Publication on the web site shall continue until one year 5592
after the date a judgment is rendered under section 5721.19 of 5593
the Revised Code with respect to such property. Any notices 5594
published on a web site shall identify the date the notice is 5595
first published on the web site. If proceeding under division 5596
(A)(1) of this section, the second and third publication of the 5597
notice may be abbreviated as authorized under section 7.16 of 5598
the Revised Code. 5599
Service shall be complete, if proceeding under division 5600
(A)(1) of this section, at the expiration of three weeks after 5601
the date of the first publication or, if proceeding under 5602
division (A)(2) of this section, the date that is two weeks 5603
after the clerk causes the notice to be published on the 5604
selected web site. In any proceeding prosecuted under this 5605
section, if the prosecuting attorney determines that service 5606
upon a defendant may be obtained ultimately only by publication, 5607
the prosecuting attorney may cause service to be made 5608
simultaneously by certified mail, return receipt requested, 5609
ordinary mail, and publication. 5610
In any county that has adopted a permanent parcel number 5611
system, the parcel may be described in the notice by parcel 5612
number only, instead of also with a complete legal description, 5613
if the prosecuting attorney determines that the publication of 5614

H. B. No. 86 Page 200
As Passed by the House
the complete legal description is not necessary to provide 5615
reasonable notice of the foreclosure proceeding to the 5616
interested parties. If the complete legal description is not 5617
published, the notice shall indicate where the complete legal 5618
description may be obtained. 5619
It is sufficient, having been made a proper party to the 5620
foreclosure proceeding, for the treasurer to allege in the 5621
treasurer's complaint that the certificate or master list has 5622
been duly filed by the auditor, that the amount of money 5623
appearing to be due and unpaid is due and unpaid, and that there 5624
is a lien against the property described in the certificate or 5625
master list, without setting forth in the complaint any other or 5626
special matter relating to the foreclosure proceeding. The 5627
prayer of the complaint shall be that the court or the county 5628
board of revision with jurisdiction pursuant to section 323.66 5629
of the Revised Code issue an order that the property be sold or 5630
conveyed by the sheriff or otherwise be disposed of, and the 5631
equity of redemption be extinguished, according to the 5632
alternative redemption procedures prescribed in sections 323.65 5633
to 323.79 of the Revised Code, or, if the action is in the 5634
municipal court by the bailiff, in the manner provided in 5635
section 5721.19 of the Revised Code. 5636
In the foreclosure proceeding, the treasurer may join in 5637
one action any number of lots or lands, but the decree shall be 5638
rendered separately, and any proceedings may be severed, in the 5639
discretion of the court or board of revision, for the purpose of 5640
trial or appeal, and the court or board of revision shall make 5641
such order for the payment of costs as is considered proper. The 5642
certificate or master list filed by the auditor with the 5643
prosecuting attorney is prima-facie evidence at the trial of the 5644
foreclosure action of the amount and validity of the taxes, 5645

H. B. No. 86 Page 201
As Passed by the House
assessments, charges, penalties, and interest appearing due and 5646
unpaid and of their nonpayment. 5647
(B) Foreclosure proceedings constituting an action in rem 5648
may be commenced by the filing of a complaint after the end of 5649
the second year from the date on which the delinquency was first 5650
certified by the auditor. Prior to filing such an action in rem, 5651
the prosecuting attorney shall cause a title search to be 5652
conducted for the purpose of identifying any lienholders or 5653
other persons with interests in the property subject to 5654
foreclosure. Following the title search, the action in rem shall 5655
be instituted by filing in the office of the clerk of a court 5656
with jurisdiction a complaint bearing a caption substantially in 5657
the form set forth in division (A) of section 5721.181 of the 5658
Revised Code. 5659
Any number of parcels may be joined in one action. Each 5660
separate parcel included in a complaint shall be given a serial 5661
number and shall be separately indexed and docketed by the clerk 5662
of the court in a book kept by the clerk for such purpose. A 5663
complaint shall contain the permanent parcel number of each 5664
parcel included in it, the full street address of the parcel 5665
when available, a description of the parcel as set forth in the 5666
certificate or master list, the name and address of the last 5667
known owner of the parcel if they appear on the general tax 5668
list, the name and address of each lienholder and other person 5669
with an interest in the parcel identified in the title search 5670
relating to the parcel that is required by this division, and 5671
the amount of taxes, assessments, charges, penalties, and 5672
interest due and unpaid with respect to the parcel. It is 5673
sufficient for the treasurer to allege in the complaint that the 5674
certificate or master list has been duly filed by the auditor 5675
with respect to each parcel listed, that the amount of money 5676

H. B. No. 86 Page 202
As Passed by the House
with respect to each parcel appearing to be due and unpaid is 5677
due and unpaid, and that there is a lien against each parcel, 5678
without setting forth any other or special matters. The prayer 5679
of the complaint shall be that the court issue an order that the 5680
land described in the complaint be sold in the manner provided 5681
in section 5721.19 of the Revised Code. 5682
(1) Within thirty days after the filing of a complaint, 5683
the clerk of the court in which the complaint was filed shall 5684
cause a notice of foreclosure substantially in the form of the 5685
notice set forth in division (B) of section 5721.181 of the 5686
Revised Code to be published either (a) once a week for three 5687
consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the 5688
county or (b) once in a newspaper of general circulation in the 5689
county and, beginning one week thereafter, on a web site of the 5690
county or of the court, as selected by the clerk. Publication on 5691
the web site shall continue until one year after the date a 5692
judgment is rendered under section 5721.19 of the Revised Code 5693
with respect to such property. The newspaper shall meet the 5694
requirements of section 7.12 of the Revised Code. Any notice 5695
published on a web site shall identify the date the notice is 5696
first published on that web site. In lieu of the form prescribed 5697
in division (B) of section 5721.181 of the Revised Code, the 5698
second and third publication of the notice, if proceeding under 5699
division (B)(1)(a) of this section, may be abbreviated as 5700
authorized under section 7.16 of the Revised Code. In any county 5701
that has adopted a permanent parcel number system, the parcel 5702
may be described in the notice by parcel number only, instead of 5703
also with a complete legal description, if the prosecuting 5704
attorney determines that the publication of the complete legal 5705
description is not necessary to provide reasonable notice of the 5706
foreclosure proceeding to the interested parties. If the 5707

H. B. No. 86 Page 203
As Passed by the House
complete legal description is not published, the notice shall 5708
indicate where the complete legal description may be obtained. 5709
After the final newspaper publication, the publisher shall 5710
file with the clerk of the court an affidavit stating the fact 5711
of the publication and including a copy of the notice of 5712
foreclosure as published. Two weeks after the clerk causes the 5713
notice to be published on the selected web site, if proceeding 5714
under division (B)(1)(b) of this section, the prosecuting 5715
attorney shall file with the clerk an affidavit stating the fact 5716
of the publication and including a copy of the notice of 5717
foreclosure and forfeiture as published. Service of process for 5718
purposes of the action in rem shall be considered as complete on 5719
the date of the third newspaper publication or the date that is 5720
two weeks after the clerk causes the notice to be published on 5721
the selected web site, as applicable. 5722
Within thirty days after the filing of a complaint and 5723
before the date service of process is considered complete under 5724
this division, the clerk of the court also shall cause a copy of 5725
a notice substantially in the form of the notice set forth in 5726
division (C) of section 5721.181 of the Revised Code to be 5727
mailed by certified mail, with postage prepaid, to each person 5728
named in the complaint as being the last known owner of a parcel 5729
included in it, or as being a lienholder or other person with an 5730
interest in a parcel included in it. The notice shall be sent to 5731
the address of each such person, as set forth in the complaint, 5732
and the clerk shall enter the fact of such mailing upon the 5733
appearance docket. If the name and address of the last known 5734
owner of a parcel included in a complaint is not set forth in 5735
it, the auditor shall file an affidavit with the clerk stating 5736
that the name and address of the last known owner does not 5737
appear on the general tax list. 5738

As Passed by the House
(2)(a) An answer may be filed in an action in rem under 5739
this division by any person owning or claiming any right, title, 5740
or interest in, or lien upon, any parcel described in the 5741
complaint. The answer shall contain the caption and number of 5742
the action and the serial number of the parcel concerned. The 5743
answer shall set forth the nature and amount of interest claimed 5744
in the parcel and any defense or objection to the foreclosure of 5745
the lien of the state for delinquent taxes, assessments, 5746
charges, penalties, and interest as shown in the complaint. The 5747
answer shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the court, 5748
and a copy of the answer shall be served on the prosecuting 5749
attorney, not later than twenty-eight days after the date 5750
service of process is considered complete under division (B)(1) 5751
of this section. If an answer is not filed within such time, a 5752
default judgment may be taken as to any parcel included in a 5753
complaint as to which no answer has been filed. A default 5754
judgment is valid and effective with respect to all persons 5755
owning or claiming any right, title, or interest in, or lien 5756
upon, any such parcel, notwithstanding that one or more of such 5757
persons are minors, incompetents, absentees or nonresidents of 5758
the state, or convicts in confinement. 5759
(b)(i) A receiver appointed pursuant to divisions (C)(2) 5760
and (3) of section 3767.41 of the Revised Code may file an 5761
answer pursuant to division (B)(2)(a) of this section, but is 5762
not required to do so as a condition of receiving proceeds in a 5763
distribution under division (B)(1) of section 5721.17 of the 5764
Revised Code. 5765
(ii) When a receivership under section 3767.41 of the 5766
Revised Code is associated with a parcel, the notice of 5767
foreclosure set forth in division (B) of section 5721.181 of the 5768
Revised Code and the notice set forth in division (C) of that 5769

H. B. No. 86 Page 205
As Passed by the House
section shall be modified to reflect the provisions of division 5770
(B)(2)(b)(i) of this section. 5771
(3) At the trial of an action in rem under this division, 5772
the certificate or master list filed by the auditor with the 5773
prosecuting attorney shall be prima-facie evidence of the amount 5774
and validity of the taxes, assessments, charges, penalties, and 5775
interest appearing due and unpaid on the parcel to which the 5776
certificate or master list relates and their nonpayment. If an 5777
answer is properly filed, the court may, in its discretion, and 5778
shall, at the request of the person filing the answer, grant a 5779
severance of the proceedings as to any parcel described in such 5780
answer for purposes of trial or appeal. 5781
(C) In addition to the actions in rem authorized under 5782
division (B) of this section and section 5721.14 of the Revised 5783
Code, an action in rem may be commenced under this division. An 5784
action commenced under this division shall conform to all of the 5785
requirements of division (B) of this section except as follows: 5786
(1) The prosecuting attorney shall not cause a title 5787
search to be conducted for the purpose of identifying any 5788
lienholders or other persons with interests in the property 5789
subject to foreclosure, except that the prosecuting attorney 5790
shall cause a title search to be conducted to identify any 5791
receiver's lien. 5792
(2) The names and addresses of lienholders and persons 5793
with an interest in the parcel shall not be contained in the 5794
complaint, and notice shall not be mailed to lienholders and 5795
persons with an interest as provided in division (B)(1) of this 5796
section, except that the name and address of a receiver under 5797
section 3767.41 of the Revised Code shall be contained in the 5798
complaint and notice shall be mailed to the receiver. 5799

(3) With respect to the forms applicable to actions 5800
commenced under division (B) of this section and contained in 5801
section 5721.181 of the Revised Code: 5802

relating to the parcel, and to exclude any such names and 5808
addresses from the published notice, except that the revised 5809
notice shall refer to the inclusion of the name and address of a 5810
receiver under section 3767.41 of the Revised Code and the 5811
published notice shall include the receiver's name and address. 5812
The notice of foreclosure also shall include the following in 5813
boldface type: 5814
"If pursuant to the action the parcel is sold, the sale 5815
shall not affect or extinguish any lien or encumbrance with 5816
respect to the parcel other than a receiver's lien and other 5817
than the lien for land taxes, assessments, charges, interest, 5818
and penalties for which the lien is foreclosed and in 5819
satisfaction of which the property is sold. All other liens and 5820
encumbrances with respect to the parcel shall survive the sale." 5821
(b) The notice to the owner, lienholders, and other 5822
persons with an interest in a parcel shall be a notice only to 5823
the owner and to any receiver under section 3767.41 of the 5824
Revised Code, and the last two sentences of the notice shall be 5825
omitted. 5826
(4) As used in this division, a "receiver's lien" means 5827
the lien of a receiver appointed pursuant to divisions (C)(2) 5828

time after the date of publication of the parcel on the 5837
delinquent tax list but before the date of a judgment of 5838
foreclosure pursuant to section 5721.19 of the Revised Code 5839
shall not nullify the right of the county to proceed with the 5840
foreclosure. 5841
Sec. 5721.183. (A) In any foreclosure action instituted 5842
pursuant to section 323.25, 323.65 to 323.79, or 5721.18 of the 5843
Revised Code in which a county land reutilization corporation, 5844
county, municipality, or township determines that the property 5845
being foreclosed upon is nonproductive land as defined in 5846
section 5722.01 of the Revised Code or abandoned land as defined 5847
in section 323.65 of the Revised Code, a county land 5848
reutilization corporation, county, municipality, or township may 5849
enter in and upon the property, including any buildings or other 5850
structures located on the property, for the purpose of 5851
inspecting the property. The inspection shall be for the 5852
purposes of assessing the property for environmental, health, or 5853
safety purposes, or for the presence of nuisance conditions 5854
under section 505.86, 505.87, 715.26, 715.261, or 3767.05 of the 5855
Revised Code. Such entry into the property may be made by 5856

locations as where access was procured, and shall do so in a 5889
manner substantially equal to or greater than how the property 5890
was secured at the time of entry. 5891
(D) An inspection by a county land reutilization 5892
corporation, county, municipality, or township in compliance 5893
with this section shall not constitute the exercise of dominion 5894
or control, or the right thereof by the corporation, county, 5895
municipality, or township. 5896
(E)(1) A county land reutilization corporation, county, 5897
municipality, or township that performs an inspection under this 5898
section shall be immune under Chapter 2744. of the Revised Code 5899
from liability in damages in a civil action for injury, death, 5900
or loss to person or property allegedly caused by any act or 5901
omission of the county land reutilization corporation, county, 5902
municipality, or township or an employee or agent of the county 5903
land reutilization, county, municipality, or township in 5904
connection with the inspection. 5905
(2) A county land reutilization corporation, county, 5906
municipality, or township or an employee or agent of the county 5907
land reutilization, county, municipality, or township that 5908

for any cause of action under the Revised Code or common law for 5910
criminal or civil trespass, construction eviction, unlawful 5911
entry, or conversion in connection with the inspection. 5912
Sec. 5721.19. (A) In its judgment of foreclosure rendered 5913
with respect to actions filed pursuant to section 5721.18 of the 5914
Revised Code, the court or the county board of revision with 5915
jurisdiction pursuant to section 323.66 of the Revised Code 5916
shall enter a finding with respect to each parcel of the amount 5917
of the taxes, assessments, charges, penalties, and interest, and 5918

H. B. No. 86 Page 210
As Passed by the House
the costs incurred in the foreclosure proceeding instituted 5919
against it, that are due and unpaid. The court or the county 5920
board of revision shall order such premises to be transferred 5921
pursuant to division (I) of this section or section 323.78 of 5922
the Revised Code or may order each parcel to be sold, without 5923
appraisal, for not less than either of the following: 5924
(1) The fair market appraised value of the parcel for 5925
taxation purposes, as determined by the county auditor, plus the 5926
costs incurred in the foreclosure proceeding; 5927
(2) The total amount of the finding entered by the court 5928
or the county board of revision, including all taxes, 5929
assessments, charges, penalties, and interest payable subsequent 5930
to the delivery to the county prosecuting attorney of the 5931
delinquent land tax certificate or master list of delinquent 5932
tracts and prior to the transfer of the deed of the parcel to 5933
the purchaser following confirmation of sale, plus the costs 5934
incurred in the foreclosure proceeding. For purposes of 5935
determining such amount, the county treasurer may estimate the 5936
amount of taxes, assessments, interest, penalties, and costs 5937
that will be payable at the time the deed of the property is 5938
transferred to the purchaser. 5939
Notwithstanding the minimum sales price provisions of 5940
divisions (A)(1) and (2) of this section to the contrary, a 5941
parcel sold pursuant to this section shall not be sold for less 5942
than the amount described in division (A)(2) of this section if 5943
the highest bidder is the owner of record of the parcel 5944
immediately prior to the judgment of foreclosure or a member of 5945
the following class of parties connected to that owner: a member 5946
of that owner's immediate family, a person with a power of 5947
attorney appointed by that owner who subsequently transfers the 5948

parcel to the owner, a sole proprietorship owned by that owner 5949
or a member of that owner's immediate family, or a partnership, 5950
trust, business trust, corporation, or association in which the 5951
owner or a member of the owner's immediate family owns or 5952
controls directly or indirectly more than fifty per cent. If a 5953
parcel sells for less than the amount described in division (A) 5954
(2) of this section, the officer conducting the sale shall 5955
require the buyer to complete an affidavit stating that the 5956
buyer is not the owner of record immediately prior to the 5957
judgment of foreclosure or a member of the specified class of 5958
parties connected to that owner, and the affidavit shall become 5959
part of the court records of the proceeding. If the county 5960
auditor discovers within three years after the date of the sale 5961
that a parcel was sold to that owner or a member of the 5962
specified class of parties connected to that owner for a price 5963
less than the amount so described, and if the parcel is still 5964
owned by that owner or a member of the specified class of 5965
parties connected to that owner, the auditor within thirty days 5966
after such discovery shall add the difference between that 5967
amount and the sale price to the amount of taxes that then stand 5968
charged against the parcel and is payable at the next succeeding 5969
date for payment of real property taxes. As used in this 5970
paragraph, "immediate family" means a spouse who resides in the 5971
same household and children. 5972
(B) Each parcel affected by the court's finding and order 5973
of sale shall be separately sold, unless the court orders any of 5974
such parcels to be sold together. 5975
Each parcel shall be advertised and sold by the officer to 5976
whom the order of sale is directed in the manner provided by law 5977
for the sale of real property on execution. The advertisement 5978
for sale of each parcel shall be published once a week for three 5979

H. B. No. 86 Page 212
As Passed by the House
consecutive weeks and, if a second sale may be required, shall 5980
include the date on which a the second sale will be conducted if 5981
no bid is accepted at the first sale. Any number of parcels may 5982
be included in one advertisement. 5983
The notice of the advertisement shall be substantially in 5984
the form of the notice set forth in section 5721.191 of the 5985
Revised Code. In any county that has adopted a permanent parcel 5986
number system, the parcel may be described in the notice by 5987
parcel number only, instead of also with a complete legal 5988
description, if the prosecuting attorney determines that the 5989
publication of the complete legal description is not necessary 5990
to provide reasonable notice of the foreclosure sale to 5991
potential bidders. If the complete legal description is not 5992
published, the notice shall indicate where the complete legal 5993
description may be obtained. 5994
(C)(1) Whenever the officer charged to conduct the sale 5995
offers any parcel for sale the officer first shall read aloud a 5996
complete legal description of the parcel, or in the alternative, 5997
may read aloud only a summary description, including the 5998
complete street address of the parcel, if any, and a parcel 5999
number if the county has adopted a permanent parcel number 6000
system and if the advertising notice prepared pursuant to this 6001
section includes a complete legal description or indicates where 6002
the complete legal description may be obtained. Whenever the 6003
officer charged to conduct the sale offers any parcel for sale 6004
and no bids are made equal to the lesser of the amounts 6005
described in divisions (A)(1) and (2) of this section and a 6006
second sale is required by law, the officer shall adjourn the 6007
sale of the parcel to the second date that was specified in the 6008
advertisement of sale. The second date shall be not less than 6009
two weeks or more than six weeks from the day on which the 6010

H. B. No. 86 Page 213
As Passed by the House
parcel was first offered for sale. The second sale shall be held 6011
at the same place and commence at the same time as set forth in 6012
the advertisement of sale. The officer shall offer any parcel 6013
not sold at the first sale. Upon the conclusion of any sale, or 6014
if any parcel remains unsold after being offered at two sales or 6015
one sale in the case of abandoned land as defined in section 6016
323.65 of the Revised Code or nonproductive land as defined in 6017
section 5722.01 of the Revised Code, the officer conducting the 6018
sale shall report the results to the court. 6019
(2)(a) If a parcel remains unsold after being offered at 6020
two sales, or one sale in the case of abandoned lands foreclosed 6021
under sections 323.65 to 323.79 of the Revised Code as defined 6022
in section 323.65 of the Revised Code or nonproductive lands as 6023
defined in section 5722.01 of the Revised Code, or if a parcel 6024
sells at any sale but the amount of the price is less than the 6025
costs incurred in the proceeding instituted against the parcel 6026
under section 5721.18 of the Revised Code, then the clerk of the 6027
court shall certify to the county auditor the amount of those 6028
costs that remains unpaid. At the next semiannual apportionment 6029
of real property taxes that occurs following any such 6030
certification, the auditor shall reduce the real property taxes 6031
that the auditor otherwise would distribute to each taxing 6032
district. In making the reductions, the auditor shall subtract 6033
from the otherwise distributable real property taxes to a taxing 6034
district an amount that shall be determined by multiplying the 6035
certified costs by a fraction the numerator of which shall be 6036
the amount of the taxes, assessments, charges, penalties, and 6037
interest on the parcel owed to that taxing district at the time 6038
the parcel first was offered for sale pursuant to this section, 6039
and the denominator of which shall be the total of the taxes, 6040
assessments, charges, penalties, and interest on the parcel owed 6041

H. B. No. 86 Page 214
As Passed by the House
to all the taxing districts at that time. The auditor promptly 6042
shall pay to the clerk of the court the amounts of the 6043
reductions. 6044
(b) If reductions occur pursuant to division (C)(2)(a) of 6045
this section, and if at a subsequent time a parcel is sold at a 6046
foreclosure sale or a forfeiture sale pursuant to Chapter 5723. 6047
of the Revised Code, then, notwithstanding other provisions of 6048
the Revised Code, except section 5721.17 of the Revised Code, 6049
governing the distribution of the proceeds of a foreclosure or 6050
forfeiture sale, the proceeds first shall be distributed to 6051
reimburse the taxing districts subjected to reductions in their 6052
otherwise distributable real property taxes. The distributions 6053
shall be based on the same proportions used for purposes of 6054
division (C)(2)(a) of this section. 6055
(3) The court, in its discretion, may order any Any parcel 6056
not sold pursuant to the original order of sale to be advertised 6057
and offered for sale at a subsequent foreclosure sale. For such 6058
purpose, the court may direct the parcel to be appraised and fix 6059
a minimum price for which it may be sold shall be forfeited to 6060
the state pursuant to Chapter 5723. of the Revised Code. 6061
(D) Except as otherwise provided in division (B)(1) of 6062
section 5721.17 of the Revised Code, upon the confirmation of a 6063
sale, the proceeds of the sale shall be applied as follows: 6064
(1) The costs incurred in any proceeding filed against the 6065
parcel pursuant to section 5721.18 of the Revised Code shall be 6066
paid first. 6067
(2) Following the payment required by division (D)(1) of 6068
this section, the part of the proceeds that is equal to five per 6069
cent of the taxes and assessments due shall be deposited in 6070

H. B. No. 86 Page 215
As Passed by the House
equal shares into each of the delinquent tax and assessment 6071
collection funds created pursuant to section 321.261 of the 6072
Revised Code. If a county land reutilization corporation is 6073
operating in the county, the board of county commissioners, by 6074
resolution, may provide that an additional amount, not to exceed 6075
five per cent of such taxes and assessments, shall be credited 6076
to the county land reutilization corporation fund created by 6077
section 321.263 of the Revised Code to pay for the corporation's 6078
expenses. If such a resolution is in effect, the percentage of 6079
such taxes and assessments so provided shall be credited to that 6080
fund. 6081
(3) Following the payment required by division (D)(2) of 6082
this section, the amount found due for taxes, assessments, 6083
charges, penalties, and interest shall be paid, including all 6084
taxes, assessments, charges, penalties, and interest payable 6085
subsequent to the delivery to the county prosecuting attorney of 6086
the delinquent land tax certificate or master list of delinquent 6087
tracts and prior to the transfer of the deed of the parcel to 6088
the purchaser following confirmation of sale. If the proceeds 6089
available for distribution pursuant to division (D)(3) of this 6090
section are sufficient to pay the entire amount of those taxes, 6091
assessments, charges, penalties, and interest, the portion of 6092
the proceeds representing taxes, interest, and penalties shall 6093
be paid to each claimant in proportion to the amount of taxes 6094
levied by the claimant in the preceding tax year, and the amount 6095
representing assessments and other charges shall be paid to each 6096
claimant in the order in which they became due. If the proceeds 6097
are not sufficient to pay that entire amount, the proportion of 6098
the proceeds representing taxes, penalties, and interest shall 6099
be paid to each claimant in the same proportion that the amount 6100
of taxes levied by the claimant against the parcel in the 6101

H. B. No. 86 Page 216
As Passed by the House
preceding tax year bears to the taxes levied by all such 6102
claimants against the parcel in the preceding tax year, and the 6103
proportion of the proceeds representing items of assessments and 6104
other charges shall be credited to those items in the order in 6105
which they became due. 6106
(E) If the proceeds from the sale of a parcel are 6107
insufficient to pay in full the amount of the taxes, 6108
assessments, charges, penalties, and interest which are due and 6109
unpaid; the costs incurred in the foreclosure proceeding 6110
instituted against it which are due and unpaid; and, if division 6111
(B)(1) of section 5721.17 of the Revised Code is applicable, any 6112
notes issued by a receiver pursuant to division (F) of section 6113
3767.41 of the Revised Code and any receiver's lien as defined 6114
in division (C)(4) of section 5721.18 of the Revised Code, the 6115
court, pursuant to section 5721.192 of the Revised Code, may 6116
enter a deficiency judgment against the owner of record of the 6117
parcel for the unpaid amount. If that owner of record is a 6118
corporation, the court may enter the deficiency judgment against 6119
the stockholder holding a majority of that corporation's stock. 6120
If after distribution of proceeds from the sale of the 6121
parcel under division (D) of this section the amount of proceeds 6122
to be applied to pay the taxes, assessments, charges, penalties, 6123
interest, and costs is insufficient to pay them in full, and the 6124
court does not enter a deficiency judgment against the owner of 6125
record pursuant to this division, the taxes, assessments, 6126
charges, penalties, interest, and costs shall be deemed 6127
satisfied. 6128
(F)(1) Upon confirmation of a sale, a spouse of the party 6129
charged with the delinquent taxes or assessments shall thereby 6130
be barred of the right of dower in the property sold, though 6131

H. B. No. 86 Page 217
As Passed by the House
such spouse was not a party to the action. No statute of 6132
limitations shall apply to such action. When the land or lots 6133
stand charged on the tax duplicate as certified delinquent, it 6134
is not necessary to make the state a party to the foreclosure 6135
proceeding, but the state shall be deemed a party to such action 6136
through and be represented by the county treasurer. 6137
(2) Except as otherwise provided in divisions (F)(3) and 6138
(G) of this section, unless such land or lots were previously 6139
redeemed pursuant to section 5721.25 of the Revised Code, upon 6140
the filing of the entry of confirmation of any sale or the 6141
expiration of the alternative redemption period as defined in 6142
section 323.65 of the Revised Code, if applicable, the title to 6143
such land or lots shall be incontestable in the purchaser and 6144
shall be free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, except a 6145
federal tax lien notice of which is properly filed in accordance 6146
with section 317.09 of the Revised Code prior to the date that a 6147
foreclosure proceeding is instituted pursuant to division (B) of 6148
section 5721.18 of the Revised Code and the easements and 6149
covenants of record running with the land or lots that were 6150
created prior to the time the taxes or assessments, for the 6151
nonpayment of which the land or lots are sold at foreclosure, 6152
became due and payable. 6153
(3) When proceedings for foreclosure are instituted under 6154
division (C) of section 5721.18 of the Revised Code, unless the 6155
land or lots were previously redeemed pursuant to section 6156
5721.25 of the Revised Code or before the expiration of the 6157
alternative redemption period, upon the filing of the entry of 6158
confirmation of sale or after the expiration of the alternative 6159
redemption period, as may apply to the case, the title to such 6160
land or lots shall be incontestable in the purchaser and shall 6161
be free of any receiver's lien as defined in division (C)(4) of 6162

H. B. No. 86 Page 218
As Passed by the House
section 5721.18 of the Revised Code and, except as otherwise 6163
provided in division (G) of this section, the liens for land 6164
taxes, assessments, charges, interest, and penalties for which 6165
the lien was foreclosed and in satisfaction of which the 6166
property was sold. All other liens and encumbrances with respect 6167
to the land or lots shall survive the sale. 6168
(4) The title shall not be invalid because of any 6169
irregularity, informality, or omission of any proceedings under 6170
this chapter, or in any processes of taxation, if such 6171
irregularity, informality, or omission does not abrogate the 6172
provision for notice to holders of title, lien, or mortgage to, 6173
or other interests in, such foreclosed lands or lots, as 6174
prescribed in this chapter. 6175
(G) If a parcel is sold under this section for the amount 6176
described in division (A)(2) of this section, and the county 6177
treasurer's estimate exceeds the amount of taxes, assessments, 6178
interest, penalties, and costs actually payable when the deed is 6179
transferred to the purchaser, the officer who conducted the sale 6180
shall refund to the purchaser the difference between the 6181
estimate and the amount actually payable. If the amount of 6182
taxes, assessments, interest, penalties, and costs actually 6183
payable when the deed is transferred to the purchaser exceeds 6184
the county treasurer's estimate, the officer shall certify the 6185
amount of the excess to the treasurer, who shall enter that 6186
amount on the real and public utility property tax duplicate 6187
opposite the property; the amount of the excess shall be payable 6188
at the next succeeding date prescribed for payment of taxes in 6189
section 323.12 of the Revised Code. 6190
(H) If a parcel is sold or transferred under this section 6191
or sections section 323.28 and or 323.65 to 323.79 of the 6192

H. B. No. 86 Page 219
As Passed by the House
Revised Code, the officer who conducted the sale or made the 6193
transfer of the property shall collect the recording fee and any 6194
associated costs to cover the recording from the purchaser or 6195
transferee at the time of the sale or transfer and, following 6196
confirmation of the sale or transfer, shall execute and record 6197
the deed conveying title to the parcel to the purchaser or 6198
transferee. For purposes of recording such deed, by placement of 6199
a bid or making a statement of interest by any party ultimately 6200
awarded the parcel, that purchaser or transferee thereby 6201
appoints the officer who makes the sale or is charged with 6202
executing and delivering the deed as agent for the purchaser or 6203
transferee for the sole purpose of accepting delivery of the 6204
deed. For such purposes, the confirmation of any such sale or 6205
order to transfer the parcel without appraisal or sale shall be 6206
deemed delivered upon the confirmation of such sale or transfer. 6207
(I) (I)(1) Notwithstanding section 5722.03 of the Revised 6208
Code, and subject to section 5721.193 of the Revised Code, if 6209
the complaint alleges that the property is delinquent vacant 6210
land as defined in section 5721.01 of the Revised Code, 6211
abandoned lands land as defined in section 323.65 of the Revised 6212
Code, or lands described in division (F) of nonproductive land 6213
as defined in section 5722.01 of the Revised Code, and if an 6214
electing subdivision indicates its desires to acquire the parcel 6215
by way of an affidavit filed in the case prior to adjudication 6216
of foreclosure, and the value of the taxes, assessments, 6217
penalties, interest, and all other charges and costs of the 6218
action exceed the auditor's fair market appraised value of the 6219
parcel for taxation purposes, then the court or board of 6220
revision having jurisdiction over the matter on motion of the 6221
plaintiff, or on the court's or board's own motion, shall, upon 6222
any adjudication of foreclosure, order, without appraisal and 6223

H. B. No. 86 Page 220
As Passed by the House
without sale, the fee simple title of the property to be 6224
transferred to and vested in an electing subdivision as defined 6225
in division (A) of section 5722.01 of the Revised Code. For 6226
purposes of determining whether the taxes, assessments, 6227
penalties, interest, and all other charges and costs of the 6228
action exceed the actual fair market value of the parcel, the 6229
auditor's most current valuation shall be rebuttably presumed to 6230
be, and constitute prima-facie evidence of, the fair market 6231
value of the parcel. In such case, the 6232
(2) The filing for journalization of a decree of 6233
foreclosure ordering that direct transfer without appraisal or 6234
sale shall constitute confirmation of the transfer and thereby 6235
terminate any further statutory or common law right of 6236
redemption. 6237
(3) Upon the journalization of a decree of foreclosure 6238
ordering direct transfer without appraisal and sale pursuant to 6239
division (I)(1) of this section, the sheriff shall execute and 6240
record a deed transferring the property to the electing 6241
subdivision named in the order, subject to division (H) of this 6242
section. Once the deed is recorded, title to the property is 6243
incontestable in the electing subdivision and free and clear of 6244
all liens for taxes, penalties, interest, charges, assessments, 6245
and all other liens and encumbrances, except for easements and 6246
covenants of record running with the land and created prior to 6247
the time at which the taxes or assessments, for the nonpayment 6248
of which the abandoned land or nonproductive land was 6249
transferred to the electing subdivision, became due and payable. 6250
Sec. 5721.192. (A) If the proceeds from a sale of a parcel 6251
under section 5721.19 or 5723.06 of the Revised Code are 6252
insufficient to pay in full the amount of the taxes, 6253

H. B. No. 86 Page 221
As Passed by the House
assessments, charges, penalties, and interest which are due and 6254
unpaid; the costs incurred in the foreclosure proceeding, the 6255
foreclosure and forfeiture proceeding, or both foreclosure and 6256
forfeiture proceedings which are due and unpaid; and, if 6257
division (B)(1) or (2) of section 5721.17 of the Revised Code is 6258
applicable, any notes issued by a receiver pursuant to division 6259
(F) of section 3767.41 of the Revised Code and any receiver's 6260
lien as defined in division (C)(4) of section 5721.18 of the 6261
Revised Code, the court may enter a deficiency judgment for the 6262
unpaid amount as authorized by sections 5721.17, 5721.19, 6263
5723.05, and 5723.18 of the Revised Code, in accordance with 6264
this section. 6265
(B) Before entering the deficiency judgment, the court 6266
shall notify the board of revision of the county in which the 6267
parcel is located, of its intention to enter the judgment, and 6268
request the board to make a recommendation with respect to 6269
whether the judgment should be entered and to specify the 6270
reasons why it should or should not be entered. The notification 6271
shall list, and shall require the board to consider in making 6272
its recommendation, the factors that the court is required to 6273
consider under divisions (C)(1) to (3) of this section, but, in 6274
making its recommendation, the board also may consider other 6275
relevant factors. Additionally, if a corporate owner of record 6276
of foreclosed lands or a corporate last owner of record of 6277
forfeited lands is involved, the court shall specify in its 6278
notification whether the judgment is proposed to be made against 6279
the corporation or the majority stockholder of the corporation. 6280
To assist the board in making its recommendation, the board may 6281
invite the person against whom the judgment would be entered to 6282
appear before it. The board shall make a recommendation to the 6283
court within thirty days from the date that the court notified 6284

H. B. No. 86 Page 222
As Passed by the House
it under this division. 6285
(C) In determining whether to enter the deficiency 6286
judgment, the court shall consider all relevant factors, 6287
including, but not limited to, the following: 6288
(1) Whether the owner of record or, in the case of 6289
forfeited lands, the last owner of record, appears to have owned 6290
the parcel only for speculative purposes, and had the means to 6291
pay, but purposely did not pay, the taxes, assessments, charges, 6292
penalties, and interest due; 6293
(2) Whether the owner of record or, in the case of 6294
forfeited lands, the last owner of record purposely failed to 6295
pay the delinquent taxes, assessments, charges, penalties, and 6296
interest, although he despite having had the means to do so; 6297
(3) Whether there are other circumstances that would make 6298
it inequitable to enter the deficiency judgment. 6299
(D) At least thirty days from the date of any notification 6300
to the board of revision under division (B) of this section, and 6301
if the court proposes to enter a deficiency judgment, the clerk 6302
of the court shall notify the person against whom the judgment 6303
is proposed to be entered, by ordinary mail, of the proposed 6304
entry of the judgment and its amount. The notification shall 6305
state that the person against whom the judgment is proposed to 6306
be entered may file, within ten days from the date the notice is 6307
mailed, a motion with the court protesting the proposed entry of 6308
the judgment and requesting an opportunity to appear and show 6309
cause why the judgment should not be entered. The notification 6310
also shall state that, if such a motion is not filed within the 6311
ten-day period, the judgment shall be entered and shall be 6312
considered to be a final judgment. If the proposed judgment 6313

H. B. No. 86 Page 223
As Passed by the House
would be entered against the majority stockholder of a 6314
corporation, the notification shall be sent to him the majority 6315
stockholder at the address of the principal office of the 6316
corporation. 6317
(E) Proceeds paid pursuant to the entry and satisfaction 6318
of a deficiency judgment shall be distributed as if they had 6319
been received as a part of the proceeds from the sale of the 6320
parcel under section 5721.19 or 5723.06 of the Revised Code to 6321
satisfy the amount of the taxes, assessments, charges, 6322
penalties, and interest which are due and unpaid; the costs 6323
incurred in the associated proceeding or proceedings which were 6324
due and unpaid; and, if division (B)(1) or (2) of section 6325
5721.17 of the Revised Code is applicable, any notes issued by a 6326
receiver pursuant to division (F) of section 3767.41 of the 6327
Revised Code and any receiver's lien as defined in division (C) 6328
(4) of section 5721.18 of the Revised Code. 6329
Sec. 5721.193. (A) Notwithstanding a county treasurer's 6330
invocation of the alternative redemption period pursuant to 6331
section 323.78 of the Revised Code, and notwithstanding any 6332
contrary provisions of that section or section 323.28, 323.65, 6333
323.73, or 5721.19 of the Revised Code, real property subject to 6334
foreclosure proceedings under section 323.28, sections 323.65 to 6335
323.79, or section 5721.18 of the Revised Code shall be offered 6336
for sale at public auction if all of the following conditions 6337
are met: 6338
(1) The owner of record of the property or party 6339
possessing an interest of record in the property files a plain 6340
statement with the court or board of revision requesting a 6341
public auction of the property. 6342
(2) The statement is filed with the court or board of 6343

H. B. No. 86 Page 224
As Passed by the House
revision at or before the final hearing. 6344
(3) The statement meets all of the following requirements: 6345
(a) It identifies the property by parcel number or common 6346
address. 6347
(b) It is signed by the party filing the statement or the 6348
party's counsel. 6349
(c) It states the party's interest of record in the 6350
property. 6351
(4) The party filing the statement serves all parties to 6352
the proceeding except those in default of answer. If the party 6353
filing the statement is a pro se individual, the party shall be 6354
exempt from this service requirement. 6355
(B) If a statement is duly filed in accordance with 6356
division (A) of this section, no person shall have the right to 6357
contest the requested public auction of the property. 6358
(C) Real property offered for sale at public auction in 6359

5721.01 to 5721.28 of the Revised Code remaining to the owner on 6375
the order of distribution, and unclaimed by such owner within 6376
sixty days from its receipt, shall be paid into the county 6377
treasury and shall be charged separately to the county treasurer 6378
by the county auditor, in the name of the supposed owner. The 6379
treasurer shall retain such excess in the treasury for the 6380
proper owner of such lands upon which the foreclosure was had, 6381
and upon demand by such owner, within three two years from the 6382
date of receipt, shall pay such excess to the owner. If the 6383
owner does not demand payment of the excess within three two 6384

assessments, penalties, interest, and charges then due and 6396
unpaid, and the costs incurred in any proceeding instituted 6397
against such land under Chapter 323. or this chapter of the 6398

expiration of the alternative redemption period as may apply 6404
under section 323.78 of the Revised Code, any person entitled to 6405
redeem the land may do so by tendering to the county treasurer 6406
an amount sufficient, as determined by the court, to pay the 6407
taxes, assessments, penalties, interest, and charges then due 6408

Revised Code, any person entitled to redeem the land, pursuant 6419
to division (A)(1) of section 323.31 of the Revised Code who has 6420
not previously defaulted on a delinquent tax contract under 6421
section 323.31 of the Revised Code with respect to that 6422
delinquent land may enter into a delinquent tax contract with 6423
the county treasurer for the payment of the taxes, assessments, 6424
penalties, interest, and charges found to be due and unpaid on 6425
such land, together with the costs incurred in the proceeding as 6426
determined by the court or board of revision, upon demonstrating 6427
that the property is in compliance with all applicable zoning 6428
regulations, land use restrictions, and building, health, and 6429
safety codes. The execution of a delinquent tax contract shall 6430
not stop the prosecution of a proceeding to judgment. The 6431
delinquent tax contract shall be paid as prescribed by section 6432
323.31 of the Revised Code over a period not to exceed five 6433

H. B. No. 86 Page 227

court or board of revision determines that the property is not 6436
in compliance with all applicable zoning regulations, land use 6437
restrictions, and building, health, and safety codes during the 6438
term of the contract. The court or board of revision shall 6439

amount set forth in the delinquent tax contract is paid, 6441
notwithstanding any conveyance of the land to another owner 6442
during the period that the delinquent tax contract is 6443

when due, or if the contract is terminated because the property 6446
is not in compliance with all applicable zoning regulations, 6447
land use restrictions, and building, health, and safety codes, 6448
the county treasurer shall, at the time the payment is due and 6449
unpaid or the contract is terminated, advise the court or board 6450
of revision rendering the judgment of foreclosure, and the court 6451
or board of revision shall order such land sold for the amount 6452
of taxes, assessments, penalties, interest, and charges then due 6453
and owing on such land in the manner provided in section 5721.19 6454
of the Revised Code, or disposed of as otherwise applicable 6455
under sections 323.65 to 323.79 of the Revised Code, without 6456
appraisal or sale. 6457
Upon the receipt of each payment pursuant to any 6458
delinquent tax contract, the county treasurer shall enter the 6459
amount of such payment on the tax duplicate, and, upon request, 6460
shall give a receipt for the amount paid to the person paying 6461
it. The receipt shall be in the form prescribed by the tax 6462
commissioner. 6463

Except as otherwise provided in this section, the portion 6464
of the amount tendered under this section representing taxes, 6465
and penalties and interest thereon, shall be apportioned among 6466
the several taxing districts in the same proportion that the 6467
amount of taxes levied by each district against the delinquent 6468
property in the preceding tax year bears to the taxes levied by 6469
all such districts against the property in the preceding tax 6470
year. The portion of the payment representing assessments and 6471
other charges shall be credited to those items in the order in 6472
which they became due. To the extent that the county treasurer, 6473
under section 321.341 of the Revised Code, had made advance 6474
payments to the several taxing districts, from sources other 6475
than the later collection of such taxes, of the current year 6476
unpaid taxes or current year delinquent taxes during the year 6477
when such taxes were levied for collection, such taxes, together 6478
with the penalties and interest charged on such taxes during 6479
such year, shall, upon collection, not be apportioned among the 6480
several taxing districts, but shall be retained by the county 6481
treasurer and applied in accordance with section 321.341 of the 6482
Revised Code. 6483
Sec. 5721.26. When joint tenants pursuant to a joint 6484

survivorship, tenants in common, or coparceners have a property 6486
right in lands or town lots, or parts of lots described in any 6487
delinquent land tax certificate or delinquent vacant land tax 6488
certificate, and a person having such right in that property 6489
fails to join in the redemption of such delinquent land tax or 6490
for any cause cannot be joined in any such redemption, the 6491
county auditor may entertain the application of so many of such 6492
persons as join in the application, and may make a certificate 6493
releasing such portion of the land or lot as the person making 6494

holder may be, upon receipt of instructions from the purchaser, 6735
that of the secured party of the actual purchaser, or an agent 6736
or custodian for the purchaser or secured party. The county 6737

certificate holder. The county treasurer shall apportion the 6739

penalties, and interest among the several taxing districts in 6741
the same proportion that the amount of taxes levied by each 6742
district against the certificate parcel in the preceding tax 6743
year bears to the taxes levied by all such districts against the 6744
certificate parcel in the preceding tax year, and credit the 6745
part of the proceeds representing assessments and other charges 6746
to the items of assessments and charges in the order in which 6747
those items became due. Upon issuing a tax certificate, the 6748
delinquent taxes that make up the certificate purchase price are 6749
transferred, and the superior lien of the state and its taxing 6750
districts for those delinquent taxes is conveyed intact to the 6751
certificate holder. 6752
(F) If a tax certificate is offered for sale under this 6753
section but is not sold, the county treasurer may sell the 6754
certificate in a negotiated sale authorized under section 6755
5721.33 of the Revised Code, or may strike the corresponding 6756
certificate parcel from the list of parcels selected for tax 6757
certificate sales. The lien for taxes, assessments, charges, 6758
penalties, and interest against a parcel stricken from the list 6759
thereafter may be foreclosed in the manner prescribed by section 6760
323.25, sections 323.65 to 323.79, or section 5721.14 or 5721.18 6761

(H) When selling a tax certificate under this section, the 6774
county treasurer shall charge a fee to the purchaser of the 6775
certificate. The county treasurer shall set the fee at a 6776
reasonable amount that covers the treasurer's costs of 6777
administering the sale of the tax certificate. The county 6778
treasurer shall deposit the fee in the county treasury to the 6779
credit of the tax certificate administration fund. 6780
(I) After selling a tax certificate under this section, 6781
the county treasurer shall send written notice to the owner of 6782
the certificate parcel by certified mail or, if the treasurer 6783
has record of an internet identifier of record associated with 6784

tax certificate was sold, shall describe the owner's options to 6788

(1) A premium to be added to or discount to be subtracted 6804
from the certificate purchase price for the tax certificates; 6805

As Passed by the House
(C) The county treasurer may execute a tax certificate 6820
sale/purchase agreement and other necessary agreements with a 6821
designated purchaser or purchasers to complete a negotiated sale 6822
or transfer of tax certificates. 6823
(D) The tax certificate may be sold at a premium to or 6824
discount from the certificate purchase price. The county 6825
treasurer may establish as one of the terms of the negotiated 6826
sale the portion of the certificate purchase price, plus any 6827
applicable premium or less any applicable discount, that the 6828
purchaser or purchasers shall pay in cash on the date the tax 6829
certificates are sold and the portion, if any, of the 6830
certificate purchase price, plus any applicable premium or less 6831
any applicable discount, that the purchaser or purchasers shall 6832
pay in noncash consideration and the nature of that 6833
consideration. 6834
The county treasurer shall sell such tax certificates at a 6835
certificate purchase price, plus any applicable premium and less 6836
any applicable discount, and at a certificate rate of interest 6837
that, in the treasurer's determination, are in the best 6838
interests of the county. 6839
(E)(1) The county treasurer shall adopt rules governing 6840
the eligibility of persons to purchase tax certificates or to 6841
otherwise participate in a negotiated sale under this section. 6842
The rules may provide for precertification of such persons, 6843
including a requirement for disclosure of income, assets, and 6844
any other financial information the county treasurer determines 6845
appropriate. The rules also may prohibit any person that is 6846
delinquent in the payment of any tax to the county or to the 6847
state, or that is in default in or on any other obligation to 6848
the county or to the state, from purchasing a tax certificate or 6849

authorize the county treasurer to receive notes in lieu of cash, 6853
with such notes being payable to the treasurer upon the receipt 6854
or enforcement of such taxes, assessments, charges, costs, 6855
penalties, and interest, and as otherwise further agreed between 6856
the corporation and the treasurer. The eligibility information 6857
required shall include the tax identification number of the 6858
purchaser and may include the tax identification number of the 6859
participant. The county treasurer, upon request, shall provide a 6860
copy of the rules adopted under this section. 6861
(2) Any person that intends to purchase a tax certificate 6862
in a negotiated sale shall submit an affidavit to the county 6863
treasurer that establishes compliance with the applicable 6864
eligibility criteria and includes any other information required 6865
by the treasurer. Any person that fails to submit such an 6866
affidavit is ineligible to purchase a tax certificate. Any 6867
person that knowingly submits a false or misleading affidavit 6868
shall forfeit any tax certificate or certificates purchased by 6869
the person at a sale for which the affidavit was submitted, 6870
shall be liable for payment of the full certificate purchase 6871
price, plus any applicable premium and less any applicable 6872
discount, of the tax certificate or certificates, and shall be 6873
disqualified from participating in any tax certificate sale 6874
conducted in the county during the next five years. 6875
(3) A tax certificate shall not be sold to the owner of 6876
the certificate parcel or to any corporation, partnership, or 6877
association in which such owner has an interest. No person that 6878
purchases a tax certificate in a negotiated sale shall assign or 6879
transfer the tax certificate to the owner of the certificate 6880

H. B. No. 86 Page 242
As Passed by the House
parcel or to any corporation, partnership, or association in 6881
which the owner has an interest. Any person that knowingly or 6882
negligently transfers or assigns a tax certificate to the owner 6883
of the certificate parcel or to any corporation, partnership, or 6884
association in which such owner has an interest shall be liable 6885
for payment of the full certificate purchase price, plus any 6886
applicable premium and less any applicable discount, and shall 6887
not be entitled to a refund of any amount paid. Such tax 6888
certificate shall be deemed void and the tax lien sold under the 6889
tax certificate shall revert to the county as if no sale of the 6890
tax certificate had occurred. 6891
(F) The purchaser in a negotiated sale under this section 6892
shall deliver the certificate purchase price or other 6893
consideration, plus any applicable premium and less any 6894
applicable discount and including any noncash consideration, to 6895
the county treasurer not later than the close of business on the 6896
date the tax certificates are delivered to the purchaser. The 6897
certificate purchase price, less any applicable discount, or 6898
portion of the price, that is paid in cash shall be deposited in 6899
the county's general fund to the credit of the account to which 6900
ad valorem real property taxes are credited and further credited 6901
as provided in division (G) of this section. Any applicable 6902
premium that is paid shall be, at the discretion of the county 6903
treasurer, apportioned to and deposited in any authorized county 6904
fund. The purchaser also shall pay on the date the tax 6905
certificates are delivered to the purchaser the fee, if any, 6906
negotiated under division (J) of this section. If the purchaser 6907
fails to pay the certificate purchase price, plus any applicable 6908
premium and less any applicable discount, and any such fee, 6909
within the time periods required by this section, the county 6910
treasurer shall retain the tax certificate and may attempt to 6911

H. B. No. 86 Page 243
As Passed by the House
sell it at any auction or negotiated sale conducted at a later 6912
date. 6913
(G) Upon receipt of the full payment from the purchaser of 6914
the certificate purchase price or other agreed-upon 6915
consideration, plus any applicable premium and less any 6916
applicable discount, and the negotiated fee, if any, the county 6917
treasurer, or a qualified trustee whom the treasurer has engaged 6918
for such purpose, shall issue the tax certificate and record the 6919
tax certificate sale by entering into a tax certificate register 6920
the certificate purchase price, any premium paid or discount 6921
taken, the certificate rate of interest, the date the 6922
certificates were sold, the name and address of the certificate 6923
holder or, in the case of issuance of the tax certificates in a 6924
book-entry system, the name and address of the nominee, and any 6925
other information the county treasurer considers necessary. The 6926
county treasurer may keep the tax certificate register in a 6927
hard-copy format or an electronic format. The name and address 6928
of the certificate holder or nominee may be, upon receipt of 6929
instructions from the purchaser, that of the secured party of 6930
the actual purchaser, or an agent or custodian for the purchaser 6931
or secured party. The county treasurer also shall transfer the 6932
tax certificates to the certificate holder. The county treasurer 6933
shall apportion the part of the cash proceeds from the sale 6934
representing taxes, penalties, and interest among the several 6935
taxing districts in the same proportion that the amount of taxes 6936
levied by each district against the certificate parcels in the 6937
preceding tax year bears to the taxes levied by all such 6938
districts against the certificate parcels in the preceding tax 6939
year, and credit the part of the proceeds representing 6940
assessments and other charges to the items of assessments and 6941
charges in the order in which those items became due. If the 6942

H. B. No. 86 Page 244
As Passed by the House
cash proceeds from the sale are not sufficient to fully satisfy 6943
the items of taxes, assessments, penalties, interest, and 6944
charges on the certificate parcels against which tax 6945
certificates were sold, the county treasurer shall credit the 6946
cash proceeds to such items pro rata based upon the proportion 6947
that each item of taxes, assessments, penalties, interest, and 6948
charges bears to the aggregate of all such items, or by any 6949
other method that the county treasurer, in the treasurer's sole 6950
discretion, determines is equitable. Upon issuing the tax 6951
certificates, the delinquent taxes that make up the certificate 6952
purchase price are transferred, and the superior lien of the 6953
state and its taxing districts for those delinquent taxes is 6954
conveyed intact to the certificate holder or holders. 6955
(H) If a tax certificate is offered for sale under this 6956
section but is not sold, the county treasurer may strike the 6957
corresponding certificate parcel from the list of parcels 6958
selected for tax certificate sales. The lien for taxes, 6959
assessments, charges, penalties, and interest against a parcel 6960
stricken from the list thereafter may be foreclosed in the 6961
manner prescribed by section 323.25, 5721.14, or 5721.18 of the 6962
Revised Code unless, prior to the institution of such 6963
proceedings against the parcel, the county treasurer restores 6964
the parcel to the list of parcels selected for tax certificate 6965
sales. 6966
(I) Neither a certificate holder nor its secured party, if 6967
any, shall be liable for damages arising from a violation of 6968
sections 3737.87 to 3737.891 3737.89 or Chapter 3704., 3734., 6969
3745., 3746., 3750., 3751., 3752., 6109., or 6111. of the 6970
Revised Code, or a rule adopted or order, permit, license, 6971
variance, or plan approval issued under any of those chapters, 6972
that is or was committed by another person in connection with 6973

H. B. No. 86 Page 245
As Passed by the House
the parcel for which the tax certificate is held. 6974
(J) When selling or transferring a tax certificate under 6975
this section, the county treasurer may negotiate with the 6976
purchaser of the certificate for fees paid by the purchaser to 6977
the county treasurer to reimburse the treasurer for any part or 6978
all of the treasurer's costs of preparing for and administering 6979
the sale of the tax certificate and any fees set forth by the 6980
county treasurer in the tax certificate sale/purchase agreement. 6981
Such fees, if any, shall be added to the certificate purchase 6982
price and shall be paid by the purchaser on the date of delivery 6983
of the tax certificate. The county treasurer shall deposit the 6984
fees in the county treasury to the credit of the tax certificate 6985
administration fund. 6986
(K) After selling tax certificates under this section, the 6987
county treasurer shall send written notice to the owner of the 6988
certificate parcel by either certified mail or, if the treasurer 6989
has record of an internet identifier of record associated with 6990
the owner, by ordinary mail and by that internet identifier of 6991
record. A mailed notice shall be sent to the owner's last known 6992
tax-mailing address. The notice shall inform the owner that a 6993
tax certificate with respect to such owner's parcel was sold or 6994
transferred and shall describe the owner's options to redeem the 6995
parcel, including entering into a redemption payment plan under 6996
division (C)(2) of section 5721.38 of the Revised Code. However, 6997
the county treasurer is not required to send a notice under this 6998
division if the treasurer previously has attempted to send a 6999
notice to the owner of the parcel at the owner's last known tax- 7000
mailing address and the postal service has returned the notice 7001
as undeliverable. 7002

certificate was sold, and not later than the end of the 7005
certificate period, a certificate holder, except for a county 7006
land reutilization corporation, may file with the county 7007
treasurer a request for foreclosure, or a private attorney on 7008
behalf of the certificate holder may file with the county 7009
treasurer a notice of intent to foreclose, on a form prescribed 7010
by the tax commissioner, provided the certificate parcel has not 7011
been redeemed under division (A) or (C) of section 5721.38 of 7012
the Revised Code and at least one certificate respecting the 7013
certificate parcel, held by the certificate holder filing the 7014
request for foreclosure or notice of intent to foreclose and 7015
eligible to be enforced through a foreclosure proceeding, has 7016
not been voided under section 5721.381 of the Revised Code. If 7017
the certificate holder is a county land reutilization 7018
corporation, the corporation may institute a foreclosure action 7019
under the statutes pertaining to the foreclosure of mortgages or 7020
as permitted under sections 323.65 to 323.79 of the Revised Code 7021
at any time after it acquires the tax certificate. 7022
(2) If, before the expiration of the certificate period, 7023
the owner of the property files a petition in bankruptcy, the 7024
county treasurer, upon being notified of the filing of the 7025
petition, shall notify the certificate holder by ordinary first- 7026
class or certified mail or by binary means of the filing of the 7027
petition. It is the obligation of the certificate holder to file 7028
a proof of claim with the bankruptcy court to protect the 7029
holder's interest in the certificate parcel. The last day on 7030
which the certificate holder may file a request for foreclosure 7031
or a notice of intent to foreclose is the later of the 7032
expiration of the certificate period or one hundred eighty days 7033
after the certificate parcel is no longer property of the 7034

H. B. No. 86 Page 247
As Passed by the House
bankruptcy estate; however, the certificate period is tolled 7035
while the property owner's bankruptcy case remains open. If the 7036
certificate holder is a county land reutilization corporation, 7037
the corporation may institute a foreclosure action under the 7038
statutes pertaining to the foreclosure of mortgages or as 7039
permitted under sections 323.65 to 323.79 of the Revised Code at 7040
any time after it acquires such tax certificate, subject to any 7041
restrictions under such bankruptcy law or proceeding. 7042
Interest at the certificate rate of interest continues to 7043
accrue during any extension of time required by division (A)(2) 7044
of this section unless otherwise provided under Title 11 of the 7045
United States Code. 7046
(3) If, before the expiration of three years from the date 7047
a tax certificate was sold, the owner of property for which the 7048
certificate was sold applies for an exemption under section 7049
3735.67 or 5715.27 of the Revised Code or under any other 7050
section of the Revised Code under the jurisdiction of the 7051
director of environmental protection, the county treasurer shall 7052
notify the certificate holder by ordinary first-class or 7053
certified mail or by binary means of the filing of the 7054
application. Once a determination has been made on the exemption 7055
application, the county treasurer shall notify the certificate 7056
holder of the determination by ordinary first-class or certified 7057
mail or by binary means. Except with respect to a county land 7058
reutilization corporation, the last day on which the certificate 7059
holder may file a request for foreclosure shall be the later of 7060
three years from the date the certificate was sold or forty-five 7061
days after notice of the determination was provided. 7062
(B) When a request for foreclosure or a notice of intent 7063
to foreclose is filed under this section, the certificate holder 7064

H. B. No. 86 Page 248
As Passed by the House
shall submit a payment to the county treasurer equal to the sum 7065
of the following: 7066
(1) The certificate redemption prices of all outstanding 7067
tax certificates that have been sold on the parcel, other than 7068
tax certificates held by the person requesting foreclosure; 7069
(2) Any taxes, assessments, penalties, interest, and 7070
charges appearing on the tax duplicate charged against the 7071
certificate parcel that is the subject of the foreclosure 7072
proceedings and that are not covered by a tax certificate, but 7073
such amounts are not payable if the certificate holder is a 7074
county land reutilization corporation; 7075
(3) If the foreclosure proceedings are filed by the county 7076
prosecuting attorney pursuant to section 323.25, sections 323.65 7077
to 323.79, or section 5721.14 or 5721.18 of the Revised Code, a 7078
fee in the amount prescribed by the county prosecuting attorney 7079

section 5721.32, 5721.33, or 5721.42 of the Revised Code, if the 7083
certificate parcel has not been redeemed and at least one 7084
certificate respecting the certificate parcel, held by the 7085
certificate holder filing the request for foreclosure and 7086
eligible to be enforced through a foreclosure proceeding, has 7087
not been voided under section 5721.381 of the Revised Code, the 7088
county treasurer, within five days after receiving a foreclosure 7089
request and the payment required under division (B) of this 7090
section, shall certify notice to that effect to the county 7091
prosecuting attorney and shall provide a copy of the foreclosure 7092

prosecuting attorney shall commence a foreclosure proceeding in 7099
the name of the county treasurer in the manner provided under 7100
section 323.25, sections 323.65 to 323.79, or section 5721.14 or 7101
5721.18 of the Revised Code, to enforce the lien vested in the 7102
certificate holder by the certificate. The prosecuting attorney 7103
shall attach to the complaint the foreclosure request and the 7104
county treasurer's written certification. 7105
(2) With respect to a certificate purchased under section 7106
5721.32, 5721.33, or 5721.42 of the Revised Code, if the 7107
certificate parcel has not been redeemed, at least one 7108

ordinary first class or certified mail or by binary means to all 7117
certificate holders other than the certificate holder 7118
represented by the attorney that a notice of intent to foreclose 7119
has been filed and that payment for the tax certificates is 7120

As Passed by the House
the Revised Code by the holder of a certificate issued under 7156
section 5721.32 of the Revised Code prior to June 24, 2008, the 7157
county treasurer, upon application by the certificate holder, 7158
may sell to the certificate holder a new certificate extending 7159
the three-year period prescribed by division (E)(1) of this 7160
section, as that division existed prior to that date, to six 7161
years after the date shown on the original certificate as the 7162
date it was sold or any extension of that date. 7163
The county treasurer and the certificate holder shall 7164
negotiate the premium, in cash, to be paid for a new certificate 7165
sold under division (E)(2) of this section. If the county 7166
treasurer and certificate holder do not negotiate a mutually 7167
acceptable premium, the county treasurer and certificate holder 7168
may agree to engage a person experienced in the valuation of 7169
financial assets to appraise a fair premium for the new 7170
certificate. The certificate holder has the option to purchase 7171
the new certificate for the fair premium so appraised. Not less 7172
than one-half of the fee of the person so engaged shall be paid 7173
by the certificate holder requesting the new certificate; the 7174
remainder of the fee shall be paid from the proceeds of the sale 7175

certificate holder shall pay the entire fee. The county 7178
treasurer shall credit the remaining proceeds from the sale to 7179
the items of taxes, assessments, penalties, interest, and 7180
charges in the order in which they became due. 7181
A certificate issued under division (E)(2) of this section 7182
vests in the certificate holder and its secured party, if any, 7183
the same rights, interests, privileges, and immunities as are 7184
vested by the original certificate under sections 5721.30 to 7185
5721.43 of the Revised Code. The certificate shall be issued in 7186

H. B. No. 86 Page 252
As Passed by the House
the same form as the form prescribed for the original 7187
certificate issued except for any modifications necessary, in 7188
the county treasurer's discretion, to reflect the extension 7189
under this division of the certificate holder's lien to six 7190
years after the date shown on the original certificate as the 7191
date it was sold or any extension of that date. The certificate 7192
holder may record a certificate issued under division (E)(2) of 7193
this section or memorandum thereof as provided in division (B) 7194
of section 5721.35 of the Revised Code, and the county recorder 7195
shall index the certificate and record any subsequent 7196
cancellation of the lien as provided in that section. The sale 7197
of a certificate extending the lien under division (E)(2) of 7198
this section does not impair the right of redemption of the 7199
owner of record of the certificate parcel or of any other person 7200
entitled to redeem the property. 7201
(3) If the holder of a certificate purchased under section 7202
5721.32, 5721.33, or 5721.42 of the Revised Code submits a 7203
notice of intent to foreclose to the county treasurer but fails 7204
to file a foreclosure action in a court of competent 7205
jurisdiction within the time specified in division (C)(2) of 7206
this section, the liens represented by all tax certificates 7207
respecting the certificate parcel held by that certificate 7208
holder, and for which the deadline for filing a notice of intent 7209
to foreclose has passed, are canceled and the certificates 7210
voided, and the certificate holder forfeits the payment of the 7211
amounts described in division (B)(2) of this section. 7212
(F) With respect to tax certificates purchased under 7213
section 5721.32, 5721.33, or 5721.42 of the Revised Code, upon 7214
the delivery to the private attorney by the county treasurer of 7215
the certification provided for under division (C)(2) of this 7216
section, the private attorney shall institute a foreclosure 7217

H. B. No. 86 Page 253
As Passed by the House
proceeding under this division in the name of the certificate 7218
holder to enforce the holder's lien, in any court or board of 7219
revision with jurisdiction, unless the certificate redemption 7220
price is paid prior to the time a complaint is filed. The 7221
attorney shall prosecute the proceeding to final judgment and 7222
satisfaction, whether through sale of the property or the 7223
vesting of title and possession in the certificate holder or 7224
other disposition under sections 323.65 to 323.79 of the Revised 7225
Code or as may otherwise be provided by law. 7226
The foreclosure proceedings under this division, except as 7227
otherwise provided in this division, shall be instituted and 7228
prosecuted in the same manner as is provided by law for the 7229
foreclosure of mortgages on land, except that, if service by 7230
publication is necessary, such publication shall be made once a 7231
week for three consecutive weeks and the service shall be 7232
complete at the expiration of three weeks after the date of the 7233
first publication. 7234
Any notice given under this division shall include the 7235
name of the owner of the parcel as last set forth in the records 7236
of the county recorder, the owner's last known mailing address, 7237
the address of the subject parcel if different from that of the 7238
owner, and a complete legal description of the subject parcel. 7239
In any county that has adopted a permanent parcel number system, 7240
such notice may include the permanent parcel number in addition 7241
to a complete legal description. 7242
It is sufficient, having been made a proper party to the 7243
foreclosure proceeding, for the certificate holder to allege in 7244
such holder's complaint that the tax certificate has been duly 7245
purchased by the certificate holder, that the certificate 7246
redemption price is due and unpaid, that there is a lien against 7247

H. B. No. 86 Page 254
As Passed by the House
the property described in the tax certificate, and, if 7248
applicable, that the certificate holder desires to invoke the 7249
alternative redemption period prescribed in sections 323.65 to 7250
323.79 of the Revised Code, without setting forth in such 7251
holder's complaint any other special matter relating to the 7252
foreclosure proceeding. The complaint shall pray for an order 7253
directing the sheriff, or the bailiff if the complaint is filed 7254
in municipal court, to offer the property for sale in the manner 7255
provided in section 5721.19 of the Revised Code or otherwise 7256
transferred according to any applicable procedures provided in 7257
sections 323.65 to 323.79 of the Revised Code, unless the 7258
complaint documents that the county auditor has determined that 7259
the true value of the certificate parcel is less than the 7260
certificate purchase price. In that case, the prayer of the 7261
complaint shall request that fee simple title to the property be 7262
transferred to and vested in the certificate holder free and 7263
clear of all subordinate liens. 7264
In the foreclosure proceeding, the certificate holder may 7265
join in one action any number of tax certificates relating to 7266
the same owner. However, the decree for each tax certificate 7267
shall be rendered separately and any proceeding may be severed, 7268
in the discretion of the court or board of revision, for the 7269
purpose of trial or appeal. Except as may otherwise be provided 7270
in sections 323.65 to 323.79 of the Revised Code, upon 7271
confirmation of sale, the court or board of revision shall order 7272
payment of all costs related directly or indirectly to the tax 7273
certificate, including, without limitation, attorney's fees of 7274
the holder's attorney in accordance with section 5721.371 of the 7275
Revised Code. The tax certificate purchased by the certificate 7276
holder is presumptive evidence in all courts and boards of 7277
revision and in all proceedings, including, without limitation, 7278

H. B. No. 86 Page 255
As Passed by the House
at the trial of the foreclosure action, of the amount and 7279
validity of the taxes, assessments, charges, penalties by the 7280
court and added to such principal amount, and interest appearing 7281
due and unpaid and of their nonpayment. 7282
(G) If a parcel is sold under this section, the officer 7283
who conducted the sale shall collect the recording fee from the 7284
purchaser at the time of the sale and, following confirmation of 7285
the sale, shall prepare and record the deed conveying the title 7286
to the parcel to the purchaser. 7287

ordinance in the case of a municipal corporation, and by 7376
resolution in the case of a county or township. The ordinance or 7377
resolution shall state that the existence of nonproductive land 7378

(B) Any county adopting a resolution under division (A) of 7383

has, by resolution, designated a county land reutilization 7413
corporation to act on its behalf under this chapter. 7414
Any property acquired by a county land reutilization 7415
corporation in a transaction other than the tax foreclosure 7416
procedures in Chapter 323., 5721., or 5723. of the Revised Code 7417
shall be subject to a priority right of acquisition by a 7418
municipal corporation or township in which the property is 7419
located for a period of thirty days after the county land 7420
reutilization corporation first records the deed evidencing 7421
acquisition of such property with the county recorder. A 7422
municipal corporation or township claiming a priority right of 7423
acquisition shall file, and the county recorder shall record, an 7424
instrument evidencing such right within the thirty-day period. 7425
The instrument shall include the name and address of the 7426

other identifying number and an affirmative statement by the 7428
municipal corporation or township that it intends to acquire the 7429
property. If the municipal corporation or township records such 7430
an instrument within the thirty-day period, then the priority 7431
right of acquisition shall be effective for a period of ninety 7432
days after the instrument is recorded. If the municipal 7433
corporation or township does not record the instrument 7434
expressing its intent to acquire the property or, if having 7435
timely recorded such instrument does not thereafter acquire and 7436
record a deed within the ninety-day period following the 7437
recording of its intent to acquire the property, then the county 7438
land reutilization corporation may dispose of such property free 7439
and clear of any claim or interest of such municipal corporation 7440
or township. If a municipal corporation or township does not 7441
record an instrument of intent to acquire property within the 7442
thirty-day period, or if a municipal corporation or township, 7443
after timely recording an instrument of intent to acquire a 7444
parcel, does not thereafter acquire the parcel within ninety 7445
days and record a deed thereto with the county recorder, the 7446
municipal corporation or township has no statutory, legal, or 7447
equitable claim or estate in property acquired by the county 7448
land reutilization corporation. This section shall not be 7449
construed to constitute an exception to free and clear title to 7450
the property held by a county land reutilization corporation or 7451
any of its subsequent transferees, or to preclude a county land 7452
reutilization corporation and any municipal corporation or 7453
township from entering into an agreement that disposes of 7454
property on terms to which they may thereafter mutually agree. 7455
Sec. 5722.03. (A) On and after the effective date of an 7456

otherwise available for acquisition pursuant to a foreclosure 7461
proceeding as provided in section 323.25, sections 323.65 to 7462
323.79, or section 5721.18 of the Revised Code, but is not sold 7463
for want of a minimum bid, shall be sold or transferred to the 7464
electing subdivision in the manner set forth in this section or 7465
sections 323.65 to 323.79 of the Revised Code. 7466
(B) Upon receipt of an ordinance or resolution under 7467
section 5722.02 of the Revised Code, the county prosecuting 7468
attorney shall compile and deliver to the electing subdivision a 7469
list of all delinquent land within the electing subdivision with 7470
respect to which a foreclosure proceeding pursuant to section 7471
323.25, sections 323.65 to 323.79, or section 5721.18 of the 7472
Revised Code has been instituted and is pending. The prosecuting 7473
attorney shall notify the electing subdivision of the identity 7474
of all delinquent land within the subdivision whenever a 7475
foreclosure proceeding pursuant to section 323.25, sections 7476
323.65 to 323.79, or section 5721.18 of the Revised Code is 7477
commenced with respect to that land. 7478
(C) The electing subdivision shall select from such lists 7479
the delinquent lands that constitute nonproductive lands that it 7480
wishes to acquire, and shall notify the prosecuting attorney of 7481
its selection prior to the advertisement and sale of the 7482
nonproductive lands pursuant to such a foreclosure proceeding, 7483
or as otherwise provided in sections 323.65 to 323.79 of the 7484
Revised Code. Notwithstanding the sales price provisions to the 7485
contrary in division (A) of section 323.28 or in divisions (A) 7486
(1) and (C) of section 5721.19 of the Revised Code, selected 7487
nonproductive lands subject to a foreclosure proceeding pursuant 7488

H. B. No. 86 Page 262
As Passed by the House
of the Revised Code that require a sale shall be advertised for 7490
sale and be sold, without appraisal, for not less than the 7491
amount determined under division (A)(1) of section 323.28 or 7492
sections 323.65 to 323.79 of the Revised Code in the case of 7493
selected nonproductive lands subject to a foreclosure proceeding 7494
pursuant to section 323.25 or sections 323.65 to 323.79 of the 7495
Revised Code, or the amount determined under division (A)(2) of 7496
section 5721.19 in the case of selected nonproductive lands 7497
subject to a foreclosure proceeding pursuant to section 5721.18 7498
of the Revised Code, or as prescribed in sections 323.65 to 7499
323.79 of the Revised Code. Except as otherwise authorized in 7500
section 323.78 of the Revised Code, all nonproductive lands so 7501
selected, when advertised for sale pursuant to a foreclosure 7502
proceeding, shall be advertised separately from the 7503
advertisement applicable to other delinquent lands. 7504
Notwithstanding division (A) of section 5721.191 of the Revised 7505
Code, the minimum amount for which selected nonproductive lands 7506
subject to a foreclosure proceeding pursuant to section 5721.18 7507
of the Revised Code will be sold, as specified in the 7508
advertisement for sale, shall equal the sum of the taxes, 7509
assessments, charges, penalties, interest, and costs due on the 7510
parcel as determined under division (A)(2) of section 5721.19 of 7511
the Revised Code. Notwithstanding provisions to the contrary in 7512
division (A) of section 323.28 of the Revised Code, the minimum 7513
amount for which selected nonproductive lands subject to a 7514
foreclosure proceeding pursuant to section 323.25 of the Revised 7515
Code will be sold, as specified in the advertisement for sale, 7516
shall equal the amount specified in division (A)(1) of section 7517
323.28 of the Revised Code. The advertisement relating to the 7518
selected nonproductive lands also shall include a statement that 7519
the lands have been determined by the electing subdivision to be 7520
nonproductive lands and that, if at a foreclosure sale no bid 7521

H. B. No. 86 Page 263
As Passed by the House
for the appropriate amount specified in this division is 7522
received, such lands shall be sold or transferred to the 7523
electing subdivision. 7524
(D) If any nonproductive land selected by an electing 7525
subdivision is advertised and offered for sale at one sale 7526
pursuant to this section but is not sold for want of a minimum 7527
bid, the electing subdivision that selected the nonproductive 7528
land shall be deemed to have submitted the winning bid at such 7529
sale, and the land is deemed sold to the electing subdivision 7530
for no consideration other than the amounts charged under 7531
divisions (E) and (F) of this section. If both a county and a 7532
township within that county have adopted a resolution pursuant 7533
to section 5722.02 of the Revised Code and both subdivisions 7534
select the same parcel or parcels of land, the subdivision that 7535
first notifies the prosecuting attorney of such selection shall 7536
be the electing subdivision deemed to have submitted the winning 7537
bid under this division. If a municipal corporation and a county 7538
land reutilization corporation select the same parcel or parcels 7539
of land, the municipal corporation shall be deemed the winning 7540
bidder under this division. The officer conducting the sale 7541
shall announce the bid of the electing subdivision at the sale 7542
and shall report the proceedings to the court or board of 7543
revision for confirmation of sale. 7544
(E) Upon the sale or transfer of any nonproductive land to 7545
an electing subdivision, the county auditor shall charge the 7546
costs, as determined by the court or board of revision, incurred 7547
in the foreclosure proceeding instituted under section 323.25, 7548
sections 323.65 to 323.79, or section 5721.18 of the Revised 7549
Code and applicable to the nonproductive land to the taxing 7550
districts, including the electing subdivision, in direct 7551
proportion to their interest in the taxes, assessments, charges, 7552

H. B. No. 86 Page 264
As Passed by the House
penalties, and interest on the nonproductive land due and 7553
payable at the time the land was sold pursuant to the 7554
foreclosure proceeding. The interest of each taxing district in 7555
the taxes, assessments, charges, penalties, and interest on the 7556
nonproductive land shall bear the same proportion to the amount 7557
of those taxes, assessments, charges, penalties, and interest 7558
that the amount of taxes levied by each district against the 7559
nonproductive land in the preceding tax year bears to the taxes 7560
levied by all such districts against the nonproductive land in 7561
the preceding tax year. If the electing subdivision is a county 7562
land reutilization corporation and the nonproductive land is 7563
sold or transferred to the corporation, the corporation shall be 7564
deemed to have the proportionate interest of the county on whose 7565
behalf it has been designated and organized in the taxes, 7566
assessments, charges, penalties, and interest on the 7567
nonproductive land in that county. In making a semiannual 7568
apportionment of funds, the auditor shall retain at the next 7569
apportionment the amount charged to each such taxing district, 7570
except that in the case of nonproductive land sold or 7571
transferred to a county land reutilization corporation, the 7572
auditor shall provide an invoice to the corporation for the 7573
amount charged to it. The costs retained by the auditor shall be 7574
deposited to the credit of the county treasurer's delinquent tax 7575
and assessment collection fund and the county prosecutor's 7576
delinquent tax and assessment collection fund under section 7577
321.261 of the Revised Code to reimburse the treasurer and 7578
prosecutor according to actual identified and advanced costs 7579
expended by the prosecutor or treasurer, equally, or in 7580
proportion to the percentage that each of their costs bears to 7581
the total costs. 7582
(F) The officer conducting the sale shall execute and file 7583

of the Revised Code. If the alternative redemption period 7587
applies under section 323.78 of the Revised Code, the officer 7588
shall not execute the deed and file it for recording until the 7589

payable. 7598
When title to a parcel of land upon which a lien has been 7599
placed under section 715.261, 743.04, or 6119.06 of the Revised 7600
Code is transferred to a county land reutilization corporation 7601
under this section, the lien on the parcel shall be extinguished 7602
if the lien is for costs or charges that were incurred before 7603
the date of the transfer to the corporation and if the 7604
corporation did not incur the costs or charges, regardless of 7605
whether the lien was attached or the costs or charges were 7606

subdivision shall be deemed to have submitted the winning bid, 7718
and the land is deemed sold to the electing subdivision for no 7719
consideration other than the fee charged under division (C) of 7720
this section. If both a county and a township in that county 7721
have adopted a resolution pursuant to section 5722.02 of the 7722
Revised Code and both subdivisions select the same parcel or 7723
parcels of land, the electing subdivision deemed to have 7724

the electing subdivision is incontestable and free and clear 7737
from all liens and encumbrances, except taxes and special 7738
assessments that are not due at the time of the sale and any 7739
easements and covenants of record running with the land and 7740
created prior to the time at which the taxes or assessments, for 7741
the nonpayment of which the nonproductive land was forfeited, 7742
became due and payable. 7743
When title to a parcel of land upon which a lien has been 7744
placed under section 715.261, 743.04, or 6119.06 of the Revised 7745
Code is transferred to a county land reutilization corporation 7746
under this section, the lien on the parcel shall be extinguished 7747
if the lien is for costs or charges that were incurred before 7748
the date of the transfer to the corporation and if the 7749
corporation did not incur the costs or charges, regardless of 7750
whether the lien was attached or the costs or charges were 7751
certified before the date of transfer. In such a case, the 7752
corporation and its successors in title shall take title to the 7753
property free and clear of any such lien and shall be immune 7754
from liability in any action to collect such costs or charges. 7755

shall be deemed a bona fide purchaser for value without 7760
knowledge of such costs or lien, regardless of whether the 7761
corporation had actual or constructive knowledge of the costs or 7762
lien, and any such lien shall be void and unenforceable against 7763
the corporation and its successors in title. 7764
At the time of the sale, the auditor shall collect and the 7765

electing subdivision shall pay the fee required by law for 7766
transferring and recording of deeds. 7767
Upon delivery of a deed conveying any nonproductive land 7768

of the forfeiture and sale of the nonproductive land to the 7772
taxing districts, including the electing subdivision, in direct 7773
proportion to their interest in the taxes, assessments, charges, 7774
interest, and penalties on the nonproductive land due and 7775
payable at the time the land was sold at the forfeiture sale. 7776
The interest of each taxing district in the taxes, assessments, 7777
charges, penalties, and interest on the nonproductive land shall 7778
bear the same proportion to the amount of those taxes, 7779
assessments, charges, penalties, and interest that the amount of 7780
taxes levied by each district against the nonproductive land in 7781
the preceding tax year bears to the taxes levied by all such 7782
districts against the nonproductive land in the preceding tax 7783
year. If the electing subdivision is a county land reutilization 7784
corporation and the nonproductive land is sold or transferred to 7785
the corporation, the corporation shall be deemed to have the 7786
proportionate interest of the county designating or organizing 7787
such corporation in the taxes, assessments, charges, penalties, 7788
and interest on the nonproductive land in the county. In making 7789
a semiannual apportionment of funds, the auditor shall retain at 7790
the next apportionment the amount charged to each such taxing 7791
district, except that in the case of nonproductive land conveyed 7792
to a county land reutilization corporation the auditor shall 7793
invoice the corporation the amount charged to it. 7794

5722.04, or 5723.04 of the Revised Code to an electing 7803
subdivision, no action shall be commenced, nor shall any defense 7804
be asserted, after one year from the date the deed conveying 7805
such land to the electing subdivision is filed for record, to 7806
question the validity of the title vested in the electing 7807
subdivision by such sale or transfer for any irregularity, 7808

benefit of itself and of other taxing districts having an 7819
interest in the taxes, assessments, charges, interest, and 7820
penalties due and owing thereon at the time of the property's 7821

for sale. Such a request by the county land reutilization 8400
corporation shall not obligate the corporation to acquire the 8401
tract or tracts pursuant to division (B) of this section or 8402
section 5722.04 of the Revised Code. A county land reutilization 8403
corporation shall not request that a tract of forfeited land not 8404

be offered for sale if, as a result of one or more previous 8405
requests of the county land reutilization corporation, the tract 8406
of land has not been offered for sale for three consecutive 8407
years. 8408
Sec. 5723.05. If the taxes, assessments, charges, 8409
penalties, interest, and costs due on the forfeited lands have 8410
not been paid when the county auditor fixes the date for the 8411
sale of forfeited lands, the auditor shall give notice of them 8412
once a week for two consecutive weeks prior to the date fixed by 8413
the auditor for the sale, as provided in section 5721.03 of the 8414
Revised Code. The notice shall state that if the taxes, 8415
assessments, charges, penalties, interest, and costs charged 8416
against the lands forfeited to the state for nonpayment of taxes 8417
are not paid into the county treasury, and the county 8418
treasurer's receipt produced for the payment before the time 8419
specified in the notice for the sale of the lands, which day 8420
shall be named in the notice, each forfeited tract on which the 8421
taxes, assessments, charges, penalties, interest, and costs 8422
remain unpaid will be offered for sale beginning on the date set 8423
by the auditor, at the courthouse in the county, in order to 8424
satisfy the unpaid taxes, assessments, charges, penalties, 8425
interest, and costs, and that the sale will continue from day to 8426
day until each of the tracts in the sale is sold or offered for 8427
sale. 8428
The notice also shall state that, if the forfeited land is 8429
sold for an amount that is less than the amount of the 8430
delinquent taxes, assessments, charges, penalties, and interest 8431
against it, and, if division (B)(2) of section 5721.17 of the 8432
Revised Code is applicable, any notes issued by a receiver 8433
pursuant to division (F) of section 3767.41 of the Revised Code 8434
and any receiver's lien as defined in division (C)(4) of section 8435

As Passed by the House
5721.18 of the Revised Code, the court, in a separate order, may 8436
enter a deficiency judgment against the last owner of record of 8437
the land before its forfeiture to the state, for the amount of 8438
the difference; and that, if that owner of record is a 8439
corporation, the court may enter the deficiency judgment against 8440
the stockholder holding a majority of that corporation's stock. 8441
Sec. 5723.06. (A)(1) The county auditor, on the day set 8442
for the sale of forfeited lands provided in section 5723.04 of 8443
the Revised Code, shall attend at the courthouse and offer for 8444
sale the whole of each tract of land as contained in the list 8445
provided for in such section to be included in the sale, at 8446
public auction, to the highest bidder, for an amount sufficient 8447
to pay the lesser of the amounts described in divisions (A)(1) 8448
and (2) of section 5721.16 of the Revised Code following: 8449
(a) The appraised value of the parcel for taxation 8450
purposes, as determined by the county auditor and as specified 8451
in the delinquent land tax certificate or master list of 8452
delinquent tracts, plus the costs incurred in the foreclosure 8453
proceedings and forfeiture proceedings; 8454
(b) The total amount of the finding entered by the court 8455
or board of revision, and all subsequent taxes, assessments, 8456
charges, penalties, and interest due and payable at the time of 8457
journalization of the order of forfeiture described in section 8458
5723.01 of the Revised Code, plus the costs incurred in the 8459
foreclosure and forfeiture proceedings. For purposes of 8460
determining such amount, the county treasurer may estimate the 8461
amount of taxes, assessments, interest, penalties, and costs 8462
that will be payable at the time the land is forfeited to the 8463
state. 8464
The sale may be conducted at any location in the county 8465

H. B. No. 86 Page 294
As Passed by the House
considered appropriate by the county auditor shall offer each 8466
tract separately, beginning with the first tract contained in 8467
the list. 8468
(2) If no bid is received for any of the tracts in an 8469
amount sufficient to pay the required amount prescribed in 8470
division (A)(1) of this section, and no notice is given under 8471
section 5722.04 of the Revised Code or division (B) of this 8472
section, the auditor may elect to offer such tract for sale 8473
forthwith, and sell it for the best price obtainable. The county 8474
auditor shall continue through such list and may adjourn the 8475
sale from day to day until the county auditor has disposed of or 8476
offered for sale each tract of land specified in the notice. The 8477
county auditor may offer a tract of land two or more times at 8478
the same sale. 8479
(3) Notwithstanding the minimum sales price provisions of 8480
divisions (A)(1) and (2) of this section to the contrary, 8481
forfeited lands sold pursuant to this section shall not be sold 8482
in either of the following circumstances: 8483
(a) To any person that is delinquent on real property 8484
taxes in this state; 8485
(b) For less than the total amount of the taxes, 8486
assessments, penalties, interest, and costs that stand charged 8487
against the land if the highest bidder is the owner of record of 8488
the parcel immediately prior to the judgment of foreclosure or 8489
foreclosure and forfeiture, or a member of the following class 8490
of parties connected to that owner: a member of that owner's 8491
immediate family, a person with a power of attorney appointed by 8492
that owner who subsequently transfers the parcel to the owner, a 8493
sole proprietorship owned by that owner or a member of that 8494
owner's immediate family, or a partnership, trust, business 8495

H. B. No. 86 Page 295
As Passed by the House
trust, corporation, or association in which the owner or a 8496
member of the owner's immediate family owns or controls directly 8497
or indirectly more than fifty per cent. 8498
If a parcel sells for less than the total amount of the 8499
taxes, assessments, penalties, interest, and costs that stand 8500
charged against it, the officer conducting the sale shall 8501
require the buyer to complete an affidavit prepared by the 8502
officer stating that the buyer is not the owner of record 8503
immediately prior to the judgment of foreclosure or foreclosure 8504
and forfeiture, or a member of the specified class of parties 8505
connected to that owner, and the affidavit shall become part of 8506
the court records of the proceeding. If the county auditor 8507
discovers within three years after the date of the sale that a 8508
parcel was sold to that owner or a member of the specified class 8509
of parties connected to that owner for a price less than the 8510
amount so described, and if the parcel is still owned by that 8511
owner or a member of the specified class of parties connected to 8512
that owner, the auditor within thirty days after such discovery 8513
shall add the difference between that amount and the sale price 8514
to the amount of taxes that then stand charged against the 8515
parcel and is payable at the next succeeding date for payment of 8516
real property taxes. As used in this paragraph, "immediate 8517
family" means a spouse who resides in the same household and 8518
children. 8519
(B) The director of natural resources may give written 8520
notice to the auditor prior to the time of the sale of the 8521
director's intention to purchase forfeited land for the state. 8522
Such notice is a legal minimum bid at the time of the sale, and, 8523
if no bid is received in an amount sufficient to pay the lesser 8524
of the amounts described in divisions division (A)(1) and (2) of 8525
this section 5721.16 of the Revised Code, the land is deemed 8526

H. B. No. 86 Page 296
As Passed by the House
sold to the state for no consideration. The director of natural 8527
resources shall record the deed. 8528
(C) The sale of forfeited land under this section conveys 8529
the title to the tract or parcel of land, divested of all 8530
liability for any taxes, assessments, charges, penalties, 8531
interest, and costs due at the time of sale that remain after 8532
applying the amount for which it was sold, except as otherwise 8533
provided in division (D) of this section. 8534
(D) If the parcel is sold for the amount described in 8535
division (A)(2) of section 5721.16 of the Revised Code (A)(1)(b) 8536
of this section, and the county treasurer's estimate of that 8537
amount exceeds the amount of taxes, assessments, interest, 8538
penalties, and costs actually payable when the deed is 8539
transferred to the purchaser land is forfeited to the state, the 8540
county auditor shall refund to the purchaser the difference 8541
between the estimate and the amount actually payable. If the 8542
amount of taxes, assessments, interest, penalties, and costs 8543
actually payable when the deed is transferred to the purchaser 8544
land is forfeited to the state exceeds the county treasurer's 8545
estimate, the county auditor shall certify the amount of the 8546
excess to the treasurer, who shall enter that amount on the real 8547
and public utility property tax duplicate opposite the property; 8548
the amount of the excess shall be payable at the next succeeding 8549
date prescribed for payment of taxes in section 323.12 of the 8550
Revised Code. 8551
(E) The successful bidder shall pay the county auditor a 8552
deposit of at least ten per cent of the sale price in cash, or 8553
by bank draft or official bank check, at the time of the public 8554
auction, and shall pay the balance of the sale price within 8555
thirty days after the day on which the auction was held. At the 8556

H. B. No. 86 Page 297
As Passed by the House
time of the public auction and before the successful bidder pays 8557
the deposit, the county auditor may provide notice to the 8558
successful bidder that failure to pay the balance of the sale 8559
price within the prescribed period shall be considered a default 8560
under the terms of the sale and shall result in retention of the 8561
deposit as payment for the costs associated with advertising and 8562
offering the forfeited land for sale at a future public auction. 8563
If such a notice is provided to the successful bidder and the 8564
bidder fails to pay the balance of the sale price within the 8565
prescribed period, the sale shall be voided due to default, and 8566
the county auditor shall retain the full amount of the deposit. 8567
In such a case, voiding of the sale shall occur automatically 8568
without any action necessary on the part of the county auditor. 8569
If the amount retained by the county auditor is less than the 8570
total costs of advertising and offering that tract of forfeited 8571
land for sale at a future public auction, the county auditor may 8572
initiate an action to recover the amount of any deficiency from 8573
the bidder in the court of common pleas of the county or in a 8574
municipal court with jurisdiction. 8575
Following a default and voiding of a sale under this 8576
division, the forfeited land involved in the voided sale shall 8577
be put back on the forfeited land list and disposed of in 8578
accordance with this chapter. The defaulting bidder, any member 8579
of the bidder's immediate family, any person with a power of 8580
attorney granted by the bidder, and any pass-through entity, 8581
trust, corporation, association, or other entity directly or 8582
indirectly owned or controlled by the bidder or a member of the 8583
defaulting bidder's immediate family shall be prohibited from 8584
bidding on forfeited land at any future public auction for five 8585
years from the date of the bidder's default. 8586
(F) The sale of land forfeited under this chapter bars any 8587

2103.02 of the Revised Code regardless of whether the person 8589
holding those rights was made a party to the action that 8590
resulted in the forfeiture. 8591

Sec. 5723.18. (A) Except as otherwise provided in division 8736
(B)(2) of section 5721.17 and division (B) of section 319.43 of 8737
the Revised Code, the proceeds from a forfeiture sale shall be 8738
distributed as follows: 8739
(1) The county auditor shall deduct all costs pertaining 8740
to the forfeiture and sale of forfeited lands, including costs 8741
pertaining to a foreclosure and forfeiture proceeding instituted 8742
under section 5721.14 of the Revised Code, except those paid 8743
under section 5721.04 of the Revised Code, from the moneys 8744
received from the sale of land and town lots forfeited to the 8745
state for the nonpayment of taxes, and shall pay such costs into 8746
the proper fund. In the case of the forfeiture sale of a parcel 8747
against which a foreclosure and forfeiture proceeding was 8748
instituted under section 5721.14 of the Revised Code, if the 8749
proceeds from the forfeiture sale are insufficient to pay the 8750
costs pertaining to such proceeding, the county auditor, at the 8751
next semiannual apportionment of real property taxes, shall 8752
reduce the amount of real property taxes that the auditor 8753
otherwise would distribute to each subdivision to which taxes, 8754
assessments, charges, penalties, or interest charged against the 8755
parcel are due. The reduction in each subdivision's real 8756
property tax distribution shall equal the amount of the unpaid 8757
costs multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the 8758
amount of taxes, assessments, charges, penalties, and interest 8759
due the subdivision, and the denominator of which is the total 8760
amount of taxes, assessments, charges, penalties, and interest 8761
due all such subdivisions. 8762

from the sale shall be deposited in equal shares into each of 8766
the delinquent tax and assessment collection funds created 8767
pursuant to section 321.261 of the Revised Code. 8768
(3) Following the payment required by division (A)(2) of 8769
this section, if a county land reutilization corporation is 8770
operating in the county, then an additional ten per cent of the 8771
total proceeds arising from the sale shall be deposited into the 8772
county land reutilization corporation fund created pursuant to 8773
section 321.263 of the Revised Code. 8774
(4) Following the payment payments required by division 8775
divisions (A)(2) and (A)(3) of this section, the remaining 8776
proceeds arising from the sale shall be distributed by the 8777
auditor to the appropriate subdivisions to pay the taxes, 8778
assessments, charges, penalties, and interest which are due and 8779
unpaid. If the proceeds available for distribution under this 8780
division are insufficient to pay the entire amount of those 8781
taxes, assessments, charges, penalties, and interest, the 8782
auditor shall distribute the proceeds available for distribution 8783
under this division to the appropriate subdivisions in 8784
proportion to the amount of those taxes, assessments, charges, 8785
penalties, and interest that each is due. 8786
(B) If the proceeds from the sale of forfeited land are 8787
insufficient to pay in full the amount of the taxes, 8788
assessments, charges, penalties, and interest;, the costs 8789
incurred in the proceedings instituted pursuant to this chapter 8790
and section 5721.18 of the Revised Code, or the foreclosure and 8791
forfeiture proceeding instituted pursuant to section 5721.14 of 8792
the Revised Code; and, if division (B)(2) of section 5721.17 of 8793
the Revised Code is applicable, any notes issued by a receiver 8794

5721.18 of the Revised Code, the court may enter a deficiency 8797
judgment against the last owner of record of the land before its 8798
forfeiture to the state, for the unpaid amount. The court shall 8799
enter the judgment pursuant to section 5721.192 of the Revised 8800
