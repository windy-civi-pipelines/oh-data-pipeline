Section 1:
As Introduced
136th General Assembly
Regular Session S. B. No. 285
2025-2026
Senator Schaffer
To amend section 5713.34 of the Revised Code to 1
exempt agricultural land converted to certain 2
conservation uses from recoupment charges. 3

Section 2:
Section 1. That section 5713.34 of the Revised Code be 4
amended to read as follows: 5
Sec. 5713.34. (A)(1) Upon the conversion of all or any 6
portion of a tract, lot, or parcel of land devoted exclusively 7
to agricultural use a portion of the tax savings upon such 8
converted land shall be recouped as provided for by Section 36, 9
Article II, Ohio Constitution by levying a charge on such land 10
in an amount equal to the amount of the tax savings on the 11
converted land during the three tax years immediately preceding 12
the year in which the conversion occurs. If the auditor 13
discovers that agricultural land valued at the lowest valued 14
soil type, pursuant to section 5713.31 of the Revised Code, 15
because of its use for a conservation practice or designation as 16
eligible conservation land ceases to meet that criteria sooner 17
than thirty-six months after the initial certification, the 18
auditor shall levy a charge on such agricultural land in an 19
amount equal to the reduction in taxes resulting from the land's 20
valuation at the lowest valued soil type, rather than valuation 21
S. B. No. 285 Page 2
As Introduced
at its actual soil type, in all preceding years the land was so 22
valued, not to exceed the most recent three years. The charges 23
levied under this section shall constitute a lien of the state 24
upon such converted land as of the first day of January of the 25
tax year in which the charge is levied and shall continue until 26
discharged as provided by law. 27
(2) Upon the conversion of an adequately described portion 28
of a tract, lot, or parcel of land, the county auditor shall 29
divide any numbered permanent parcel into economic units and 30
value each unit individually for the purpose of levying the 31
charge under division (A)(1) of this section against only the 32
converted portion. 33
(3) A charge shall not be levied under this section for 34
the conversion of a portion of a tract, lot, or parcel of land 35
devoted exclusively to agricultural use if the conversion is 36
incident to the construction or installation of an energy 37
facility, as defined in section 5727.01 of the Revised Code, and 38
if the remaining portion of the tract, lot, or parcel continues 39
to be devoted exclusively to agricultural use. 40
(B) Except as otherwise provided in division (C) or (D) of 41
this section, a public entity that acquires by any means and 42
converts land devoted exclusively to agricultural use and a 43
private entity granted the power of eminent domain that acquires 44
by any means and converts land devoted exclusively to 45
agricultural use shall pay the charge levied by division (A) of 46
this section and shall not, directly or indirectly, transfer the 47
charge to the person from whom the land is acquired. A person 48
injured by a violation of this division may recover, in a civil 49
action, any damages resulting from the violation. 50

boundaries of any city, local, exempted village, or joint 67
vocational school district that is wholly or partially located 68

land described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section is 72
later developed or otherwise converted to a purpose other than 73
one of the purposes enumerated under division (E)(1) of this 74
