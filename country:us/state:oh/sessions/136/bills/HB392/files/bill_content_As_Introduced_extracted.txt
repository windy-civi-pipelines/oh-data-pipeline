storing, transmitting, manipulating, or disseminating data or 25
information, including hardware, software, algorithms, 26
cryptography, artificial intelligence systems, machine learning 27
systems, quantum computing tools, and any similar technologies. 28
(3) "Artificial intelligence system" means any system that 29

As Introduced
(C)(1) Any person or other entity that implements or 49
operates an artificial intelligence system that in whole or in 50
part controls a critical infrastructure facility shall, before 51
or within a reasonable period after the deployment of the 52
system, implement a risk management policy that conforms to all 53
of the following: 54
(a) The latest version of the artificial intelligence risk 55
management framework developed by the national institute of 56
standards and technology under the United States department of 57
commerce; 58

international electrotechnical commission 4200 standard or any 60
other nationally or internationally recognized artificial 61
intelligence risk management standard or framework not referred 62
to in this section; 63
(c) All applicable federal regulations. 64
(2) The requirement to implement a risk management policy 65
under division (C)(1) of this section does not apply if the 66
artificial intelligence system is capable of completing only 67
nonexecutive tasks of a procedural or preparatory nature or 68
implementing only those decisions previously made by a human 69
decision maker, or if the artificial intelligence system is 70
exclusively an antivirus, antimalware, or cybersecurity tool. 71
