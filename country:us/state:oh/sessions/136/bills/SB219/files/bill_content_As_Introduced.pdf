shall issue the permit subject to those terms or conditions, 530
including, if applicable, terms and conditions regarding 531
subjects identified in rules adopted under section 1509.03 of 532

owner of any well, before being issued a permit under section 665
1509.06 of the Revised Code or before operating or producing 666
from a well, shall execute and file with the division of oil and 667
gas resources management a surety bond conditioned on compliance 668
with the restoration requirements of section 1509.072, the 669
plugging requirements of section 1509.12, the permit provisions 670
of section 1509.13 of the Revised Code, and all rules and orders 671
of the chief relating thereto, in an amount set by rule of the 672
chief. 673
(2) The owner may deposit with the chief, instead of a 674
surety bond, cash in an amount equal to the surety bond as 675
prescribed pursuant to this section or negotiable certificates 676
of deposit or irrevocable letters of credit, issued by any bank 677
organized or transacting business in this state, having a cash 678
value equal to or greater than the amount of the surety bond as 679

the cash shall be credited to the performance cash bond refunds 683
fund created in section 1501.16 of the Revised Code. If the 684
owner deposits certificates of deposit, the chief shall require 685
the bank that issued any such certificate to pledge securities 686
of a cash value equal to the amount of the certificate that is 687
in excess of the amount insured by the federal deposit insurance 688

may be required by the chief, a list of producing properties of 698
the owner within this state or other evidence showing ability 699
and intent to comply with the law and rules concerning 700
restoration and plugging that may be required by rule of the 701
chief. The owner of an exempt Mississippian well is not required 702
to file scheduled updates of the financial documents, but shall 703
file updates of those documents if requested to do so by the 704
chief. The owner of a nonexempt Mississippian well shall file 705
updates of the financial documents in accordance with a schedule 706
established by rule of the chief. The chief, upon determining 707
that an owner for whom the chief has accepted proof of financial 708

responsibility, shall order that the owner execute and file a 710
bond or deposit cash, certificates of deposit, or irrevocable 711
letters of credit as required by this section for the wells 712
specified in the order within ten days of receipt of the order. 713
If the order is not complied with, all wells of the owner that 714
are specified in the order and for which no bond is filed or 715
cash, certificates of deposit, or letters of credit are 716
deposited shall be plugged. No owner shall fail or refuse to 717
plug such a well. Each day on which such a well remains 718
unplugged thereafter constitutes a separate offense. 719

executed by a surety company authorized to do business in this 721
state. 722
The chief shall not approve any bond until it is 723
personally signed and acknowledged by both principal and surety, 724
or as to either by the principal's or surety's attorney in fact, 725

S. B. No. 219 Page 26

with a certified copy of the power of attorney attached thereto. 726
The chief shall not approve a bond unless there is attached a 727
certificate of the superintendent of insurance that the company 728
is authorized to transact a fidelity and surety business in this 729
state. 730
All bonds shall be given in a form to be prescribed by the 731
chief and shall run to the state as obligee. 732
(5) An owner of an exempt Mississippian well or an exempt 733
domestic well, in lieu of filing a surety bond, cash in an 734
amount equal to the surety bond, certificates of deposit, 735
irrevocable letters of credit, or a sworn financial statement, 736
may file a one-time fee of fifty dollars, which shall be 737
deposited in the oil and gas well plugging resolution and 738
remediation fund created in section 1509.071 1509.075 of the 739
Revised Code. 740
(C) An owner, operator, producer, or other person shall 741
not operate a well or produce from a well at any time if the 742
owner, operator, producer, or other person has not satisfied the 743
requirements established in this section. 744
Sec. 1509.071. (A) When the chief of the division of oil 745
and gas resources management finds that an owner has failed to 746
comply with a final nonappealable order issued or compliance 747
agreement entered into under section 1509.04, the restoration 748
requirements of section 1509.072, plugging requirements of 749
section 1509.12, or permit provisions of section 1509.13 of the 750
Revised Code, or rules and orders relating thereto, the chief 751
shall make a finding of that fact and declare any surety bond 752
filed to ensure compliance with those sections and rules 753
forfeited in the amount set by rule of the chief. The chief 754
thereupon shall certify the total forfeiture to the attorney 755

to post a new surety bond in the amount of fifteen thousand 759
dollars for a single well, thirty thousand dollars for two 760
wells, or fifty thousand dollars for three or more wells. 761
In lieu of total forfeiture, the surety or owner, at the 762
surety's or owner's option, may cause the well to be properly 763
plugged and abandoned and the area properly restored or pay to 764
the treasurer of state the cost of plugging and abandonment. 765
(B)(1) All moneys collected because of forfeitures of 766
bonds as provided in this section shall be deposited in the 767
state treasury to the credit of the oil and gas well fund 768
created in section 1509.02 of the Revised Code. 769

conservation of the state's oil and natural gas resources and 771
the proper and lawful plugging of historic oil and gas wells for 772
which there is no known responsible owner, the chief annually 773
shall spend not less than thirty per cent of the revenue 774
credited to the oil and gas well fund during the previous fiscal 775
year for both of the following purposes: 776
(a) In accordance with division (E) of this section, to 777
plug orphaned wells or to restore the land surface properly as 778
required in section 1509.072 of the Revised Code; 779
(b) In accordance with division (F) of this section, to 780
correct conditions that the chief reasonably has determined are 781
causing imminent health or safety risks at an orphaned well or 782
associated with a well for which the owner has not initiated a 783
corrective action within a reasonable period of time as 784

determined by the chief after the chief has attempted to notify 785
the owner. 786
(2) Expenditures from the oil and gas well fund and oil 787
and gas resolution and remediation fund shall be made only for 788
lawful purposes. In additionExcept as otherwise provided in 789
divisions (B)(2) and (D) of section 1509.075 of the Revised 790
Code, expenditures from the fund those funds shall not be made 791
to purchase real property or to remove a structure in order to 792
access a well. 793
The director of budget and management, in consultation 794
with the chief, shall establish an accounting code for purposes 795
of tracking expenditures made as required under this division. 796
(C)(1) If a landowner discovers a well on the landowner's 797
real property and the landowner is not the owner of the well, 798
the landowner may report the existence of the well in writing to 799
the chief. 800
(2) If the chief receives a written report from a 801
landowner of the discovery of a well previously unknown to the 802
division, the chief shall inspect the well not later than thirty 803
days after the date of receipt of the landowner's report. 804
(3) The chief shall establish a scoring matrix for use in 805
determining the priority of plugging wells or restoring land 806
surfaces at orphaned well sites for purposes of this section. 807
The matrix shall include a classification system that 808
categorizes orphaned wells as high priority, medium priority, 809
and low priority. 810
(4) The chief shall use the matrix developed under 811
division (C)(3) of this section to prioritize plugging and land 812
restoration projects under this section. The chief may add 813

S. B. No. 219 Page 29
As Introduced
additional orphaned wells to a project regardless of 814
classification. 815
(D)(1) After Except as provided in division (E)(2)(a) of 816
this section, after determining that a well is an orphaned well, 817
the chief shall do all of the following: 818
(a) Make a reasonable attempt to determine from the 819
records in the office of the county recorder of the county in 820
which the well is located the identity of the current owner of 821
the land on which the well is located, the identity of each 822
person owning a right or interest in the oil or gas mineral 823
interests, and the identities of the persons having a lien upon 824
any of the equipment appurtenant to the well. For purposes of 825
division (D)(1)(a) of this section, the chief is not required to 826

informing the person that the well is to be plugged and offering 834
the person the opportunity to remove that equipment from the 835
well site at the person's own expense in order to avoid 836
forfeiture of the equipment to this state; 837
(d) Publish notice in a newspaper of general circulation 838
in the county where the well is located that the well is to be 839
plugged or post the notice on the department of natural 840
resources web site. 841

division (D)(1)(a) of this section cannot be determined, or if a 843
notice provided by mail to a person under division (D)(1)(b) of 844
this section is returned undeliverable, the notice published 845
under division (D)(1)(d) of this section constitutes sufficient 846
notice to the person. 847
(3) If none of the persons described in division (D)(1)(a) 848
of this section removes equipment from the well within thirty 849
days after the mailing of the notice or publication or posting 850
of notice described in division (D)(1)(d) of this section, 851
whichever is later, all equipment appurtenant to the well is 852
hereby declared to be forfeited to this state without 853
compensation and without the necessity for any action by the 854
state for use to defray the cost of plugging the well and 855
restoring the land surface at the well site. 856

administrative purposes, for costs directly attributed to 882
locating, analyzing, stabilizing, designing, plugging, 883
remediating, or restoring an orphaned well, and for determining 884
if a well is an orphaned well. 885
Agents or employees of persons contracting with the chief 886
to locate, analyze, stabilize, design, plug, remediate, or 887
restore a well may enter upon any land, public or private, on 888
which the well is located, or on adjacent parcels needed for 889
access, for the purpose of performing the work. Prior to such 890
entry, the chief shall give to the following persons written 891
notice of the existence of a contract to locate, analyze, 892
stabilize, design, plug, remediate, or restore a well, the names 893
of the persons with whom the contract is made, and the date that 894
the project will commence: the owner of the well, the owner of 895
the land upon which the well is located, the owner of the land 896
of an adjacent parcel that will be entered upon, and, if the 897
well is located in the same township as or in a township 898
adjacent to the excavations and workings of a mine and the owner 899
or lessee of that mine has provided written notice identifying 900
those townships to the chief at any time during the immediately 901
preceding three years, the owner or lessee of the mine. The 902
chief may include in the notice to the owner or lessee of the 903

mine additional information, such as authorization to plug an 904
orphaned well under section 1509.151 of the Revised Code. 905
(2)(a) The owner of the land on which at least one 906
orphaned well is located who either discovers the orphaned well 907
or who has received notice under division (D)(1)(b) of this 908
section may plug any such orphaned well and be reimbursed by the 909
division of oil and gas resources management for the reasonable 910
cost of plugging such wells. In order to plug the orphaned 911
wells, the landowner shall submit an application to the chief on 912
a form prescribed by the chief and approved by the technical 913
advisory council on oil and gas created in section 1509.38 of 914
the Revised Code. The application, at a minimum, shall require 915
the landowner to provide the same information as is required to 916
be included in the application for a permit to plug and abandon 917
under section 1509.13 of the Revised Code. 918
The application shall be accompanied by a copy of a 919
proposed contract to plug and abandon the orphaned wells 920
prepared by a contractor regularly engaged in the business of 921
plugging oil and gas wells. The proposed contract shall require 922
the contractor to furnish all of the materials, equipment, work, 923
and labor necessary to plug the orphaned wells properly and 924
restore the site including the removal of all associated 925
equipment and shall specify the price for doing the work. The 926
contractor shall be insured. 927
In the case of a landowner who discovers one or more 928
orphaned wells on the land, the chief need not fulfill the 929
notice requirements specified in division (D)(1) of this 930
section, except the chief shall publish notice in a newspaper of 931
general circulation in the county where the well is located that 932
the well is to be plugged or post the notice on the department 933

Expenditures made under division (E)(2)(a) of this section 935
shall be consistent with the expenditures for activities 936
described in division (E)(1) of this section. In addition, 937
expenditures made under division (E)(2) of this section are not 938
subject to section 127.16 of the Revised Code. The application 939
constitutes an application for a permit to plug the well for the 940
purposes of section 1509.13 of the Revised Code and the 941
applicant is not required to submit the fee otherwise required 942
under that section. 943
(b) Within thirty days after receiving an application and 944
accompanying proposed contract under division (E)(2)(a) of this 945
section, the chief shall determine whether the plugging would 946
comply with the applicable requirements of this chapter and 947
applicable rules adopted and orders issued under it and whether 948
the cost of the plugging under the proposed contract is 949
reasonable. If the chief determines that the proposed plugging 950
would comply with those requirements and that the proposed cost 951
of the plugging is reasonable, the chief shall notify the 952
landowner of that determination and issue to the landowner a 953
permit to plug the well under section 1509.13 of the Revised 954
Code. The chief may disapprove an application submitted under 955
division (E)(2)(a) of this section if the chief determines that 956
the proposed plugging would not comply with the applicable 957
requirements of this chapter and applicable rules adopted and 958
orders issued under it, that the cost of the plugging under the 959
proposed contract is unreasonable, or that the proposed contract 960
is not a bona fide, arm's length contract. 961

the proposed contract to plug the well. 965
(d) Upon determining that the plugging has been completed 966
in compliance with the applicable requirements of this chapter 967
and applicable rules adopted and orders issued under it, the 968
chief shall pay the contractor for the cost of the plugging and 969
restoration as set forth in the proposed contract approved by 970
the chief and changes or costs approved by the chief. The 971
payment shall be paid from the oil and gas well fund or the oil 972
and gas resolution and remediation fund. The chief shall only 973
make payments for purposes of division (E)(2) of this section 974
pursuant to a proper invoice as defined under section 125.01 of 975
the Revised Code. 976
(e) If the chief determines that the plugging was not 977
completed in accordance with the applicable requirements, the 978
chief shall not pay the contractor or landowner for the cost of 979
the plugging. 980
(f) If any equipment was removed from the well during the 981
plugging and sold, the chief shall deduct the sale amount of the 982
equipment from the payment to the contractor. 983
(g) Changes made to a contract executed under division (E) 984
(2) of this section due to unanticipated conditions may be 985
presented to the chief in the form of a written request for 986
approval of the additional costs prior to completion of the 987
work. The chief shall determine if the changes are necessary to 988
comply with this chapter and rules adopted and orders issued 989
under it and if the cost of the changes are reasonable. The 990
chief shall provide to the contractor a written decision 991
regarding the proposed changes. If the chief determines that the 992
changes are not necessary or that the costs are not reasonable, 993

S. B. No. 219 Page 35
As Introduced
the chief may either deny the request or establish the amount of 994
the cost that the chief approves. Work completed prior to 995
receipt of written approval from the chief is not eligible for 996
payment, unless waived by the chief. 997
(3) The chief may establish an annual limit on the number 998
of wells that may be plugged under division (E)(2) of this 999
section or an annual limit on the expenditures to be made under 1000
that division. The chief may reject an application submitted 1001
under division (E)(2) of this section if the chief determines 1002
that the plugging of other wells take priority. 1003
(4) As used in division (E)(2) of this section, "plug" and 1004
"plugging" include the plugging of the well, replugging of a 1005
previously plugged orphaned well or a well for which final 1006
restoration was completed under section 1509.072 of the Revised 1007
Code and rules adopted under it, drilling out or cleanout of a 1008
well bore to remove material from a well, installation of 1009
casings, installation of a vault and vent, restoration, and the 1010

(F)(1) Expenditures from the oil and gas well fund or the 1012
oil and gas resolution and remediation fund for the purpose of 1013
division (B)(1)(b) of this section may be made pursuant to 1014
contracts entered into by either the chief or another agency of 1015
the state with persons who agree to furnish the materials, 1016
equipment, work, and labor as specified and provided in such a 1017
contract. The competitive bidding requirements of Chapter 153. 1018
of the Revised Code do not apply if the chief reasonably 1019
determines that a situation exists requiring immediate action 1020
for the correction of the applicable health or safety risk. A 1021
contract or purchase of materials for purposes of addressing the 1022
emergency situation is not subject to division (B) of section 1023

lieu of plugging the well in accordance with division (E)(2) of 1046
this section, may cause ownership of the well to be transferred 1047
in accordance with section 1509.31 of the Revised Code. 1048
If a well is transferred, the owner to whom it is 1049

interest in the tract, shall be included to the fullest extent 1140
of that interest. 1141
(2) The chief may make a motion, without application, for 1142
the operation as a unit of an entire pool or part of the pool. 1143
(B) An applicant shall include with the application for 1144

days after the date the chief receives the application or makes 1153
the motion, as applicable. 1154
(2) If the chief determines that an application is 1155
materially incomplete before the required hearing date, the 1156
chief shall notify the applicant. The applicant shall respond to 1157
the chief not later than three business days from receipt of the 1158

the operation as a unit of an entire pool or part thereof. 1163
(D) The chief shall make an order providing for the unit 1164
operation of a pool or part thereof if the chief finds that such 1165
operation is reasonably necessary to increase substantially the 1166
ultimate recovery of oil and gas, and the value of the estimated 1167

S. B. No. 219 Page 41
As Introduced
additional recovery of oil or gas exceeds the estimated 1168
additional cost incident to conducting the operation. The chief 1169
shall issue the order not later than sixty days after the date 1170
of the hearing, unless the chief denies the application or 1171
motion by order within that sixty-day period 1172
. 1173
(E) The order shall be upon terms and conditions that are 1174
just and reasonable and shall prescribe a plan for unit 1175
operations that shall include: 1176
(1) A description of the unitized area, termed the unit 1177
area; 1178

contemplated; 1180
(3) An allocation to the separately owned tracts in the 1181
unit area of all the oil and gas that is produced from the unit 1182
area and is saved, being the production that is not used in the 1183
conduct of operations on the unit area or not unavoidably lost. 1184
The allocation shall be in accord with the agreement, if any, of 1185
the interested parties. If there is no such agreement, the chief 1186
shall determine the value, from the evidence introduced at the 1187
hearing, of each separately owned tract in the unit area, 1188
exclusive of physical equipment, for development of oil and gas 1189
by unit operations, and the production allocated to each tract 1190
shall be the proportion that the value of each tract so 1191
determined bears to the value of all tracts in the unit area. 1192
(4) A provision for the credits and charges to be made in 1193
the adjustment among the owners in the unit area for their 1194
respective investments in wells, tanks, pumps, machinery, 1195

shall be paid; 1200
(6) A provision, if necessary, for carrying or otherwise 1201
financing any person who is unable to meet the person's 1202
financial obligations in connection with the unit, allowing a 1203
reasonable interest charge for such service; 1204
(7) A provision for the supervision and conduct of the 1205
unit operations, in respect to which each person shall have a 1206
vote with a value corresponding to the percentage of the 1207
expenses of unit operations chargeable against the interest of 1208
that person; 1209
(8) The time when the unit operations shall commence, and 1210
the manner in which, and the circumstances under which, the unit 1211
operations shall terminate; 1212
(9) Such additional provisions as are found to be 1213
appropriate for carrying on the unit operations, and for the 1214
protection or adjustment of correlative rights. 1215
(F) No order of the chief providing for unit operations 1216
shall become effective unless and until the plan for unit 1217
operations prescribed by the chief has been approved in writing 1218
by those owners who, under the chief's order, will be required 1219
to pay at least sixty-five per cent of the costs of the unit 1220
operation, and also by the royalty or, with respect to unleased 1221
acreage, fee owners of sixty-five per cent of the acreage to be 1222
included in the unit. If the plan for unit operations has not 1223
been so approved by owners and royalty owners at the time the 1224
order providing for unit operations is made, the chief shall 1225

S. B. No. 219 Page 43

owners, or either, owning the required percentage of interest in 1229
the unit area do not approve the plan for unit operations within 1230
a period of six months from the date on which the order 1231
providing for unit operations is made, the order shall cease to 1232
be of force and shall be revoked by the chief. 1233
(G) An order providing for unit operations may be amended 1234
by an order made by the chief, in the same manner and subject to 1235
the same conditions as an original order providing for unit 1236
operations, provided that: 1237
(1) If such an amendment affects only the rights and 1238
interests of the owners, the approval of the amendment by the 1239
royalty owners shall not be required. 1240
(2) No such order of amendment shall change the percentage 1241
for allocation of oil and gas as established for any separately 1242
owned tract by the original order, except with the consent of 1243
all persons owning interest in the tract. 1244
(H) The chief, by an order, may provide for the unit 1245
operation of a pool or a part thereof that embraces a unit area 1246
established by a previous order of the chief. Such an order, in 1247
providing for the allocation of unit production, shall first 1248
treat the unit area previously established as a single tract, 1249
and the portion of the unit production so allocated thereto 1250
shall then be allocated among the separately owned tracts 1251
included in the previously established unit area in the same 1252
proportions as those specified in the previous order. 1253
(I) Oil and gas allocated to a separately owned tract 1254

shall be deemed, for all purposes, to have been actually 1255
produced from the tract, and all operations, including, but not 1256
limited to, the commencement, drilling, operation of, or 1257
production from a well upon any portion of the unit area shall 1258
be deemed for all purposes the conduct of such operations and 1259
production from any lease or contract for lands any portion of 1260
which is included in the unit area. The operations Operations 1261
conducted pursuant to the order of the chief shall constitute a 1262
fulfillment of all the express or implied obligations terms of 1263
each lease or contract covering lands in the unit area and shall 1264
not be construed to be a breach of any such terms, to the extent 1265
that compliance with such obligations cannot be had because of 1266
terms may be inconsistent with the order of the chief. 1267
(J) Oil and gas allocated to any tract, and the proceeds 1268
from the sale thereof, shall be the property and income of the 1269
several persons to whom, or to whose credit, the same are 1270
allocated or payable under the order providing for unit 1271
operations. 1272
(K) No order of the chief or other contract relating to 1273
the sale or purchase of production from a separately owned tract 1274
shall be terminated by the order providing for unit operations, 1275
but shall remain in force and apply to oil and gas allocated to 1276
the tract until terminated in accordance with the provisions 1277
thereof. 1278
(L) Notwithstanding divisions (A) to (G) of section 155.33 1279
of the Revised Code and rules adopted under it, the chief shall 1280
issue an order for the unit operation of a pool or a part of a 1281
pool that encompasses a unit area for which all or a portion of 1282
the mineral rights are owned by the department of 1283
transportation. 1284

(M) Except to the extent that the parties affected so 1285
agree, no order providing for unit operations shall be construed 1286
to result in a transfer of all or any part of the title of any 1287
person to the oil and gas rights in any tract in the unit area. 1288
All property, whether real or personal, that may be acquired for 1289
the account of the owners within the unit area shall be the 1290
property of such owners in the proportion that the expenses of 1291
unit operations are charged. 1292
Sec. 1509.31. (A)(1) No person shall operate a well in 1293
this state unless the person first registers with and obtains an 1294
identification number from the chief of the division of oil and 1295
gas resources management. 1296
(2) Whenever the entire interest of an oil and gas lease 1297
is assigned or otherwise transferred, the assignor or transferor 1298
shall notify the holders of the royalty interests, and, if a 1299
well or wells exist on the lease, the division of oil and gas 1300
resources management, of the name and address of the assignee or 1301
transferee by certified mail, return receipt requested, not 1302
later than thirty days after the date of the assignment or 1303
transfer. When notice of any such assignment or transfer is 1304
required to be provided to the division, it shall be provided on 1305
a form prescribed and provided by the division and verified by 1306
both the assignor or transferor and by the assignee or 1307
transferee. The notice form applicable to assignments or 1308
transfers of a well to the owner of the surface estate of the 1309
tract on which the well is located shall contain a statement 1310
informing the landowner that the well may require periodic 1311
servicing to maintain its productivity; that, upon assignment or 1312
transfer of the well to the landowner, the landowner becomes 1313

proper disposal of brine obtained from the well, the plugging of 1316
the well when it becomes incapable of producing oil or gas, and 1317
the restoration of the well site; and that, upon assignment or 1318
transfer of the well to the landowner, the landowner becomes 1319
responsible for the costs of compliance with the requirements of 1320
this chapter and rules adopted under it and the costs for 1321
operating and servicing the well. 1322
(3) Notwithstanding division (A)(2) of this section, the 1323
assignee or transferee shall notify the division of oil and gas 1324
resources management of the assignment or transfer if both of 1325
the following apply: 1326
(a) The assignor or transferor failed to notify the 1327
division of the assignment or transfer as required by division 1328
(A)(2) of this section; 1329
(b) The assignor or transferor is deceased, dissolved, 1330
cannot be located, or is otherwise incapable of complying with 1331
the notification requirement. 1332
The assignee or transferee shall notify the division of 1333
the assignment or transfer on a form prescribed and provided by 1334
the division. At a minimum, the form shall require the assignee 1335
or transferee to attest that the assignee or transferee is the 1336
owner. The division shall not charge a fee for such assignment 1337
or transfer when notice is provided in accordance with division 1338
(A)(3) of this section. 1339
(B) When the entire interest of a well is proposed to be 1340
assigned or otherwise transferred to the landowner for use as an 1341
exempt domestic well, the owner who has been issued a permit 1342
under this chapter for the well shall submit to the chief of the 1343
division of oil and gas resources management an application for 1344

S. B. No. 219 Page 47
As Introduced
the assignment or transfer that contains all documents that the 1345
chief requires. The application for such an assignment or 1346
transfer shall be prescribed and provided by the chief. The 1347
chief may approve the application if the application is 1348
accompanied by a release of all of the oil and gas leases that 1349
are included in the applicable formation of the drilling unit, 1350
the release is in a form such that the well ownership merges 1351
with the fee simple interest of the surface tract, and the 1352
release is in a form that may be recorded. However, if the owner 1353
of the well does not release the oil and gas leases associated 1354
with the well that is proposed to be assigned or otherwise 1355
transferred or if the fee simple tract that results from the 1356
merger of the well ownership with the fee simple interest of the 1357
surface tract is less than five acres, the proposed exempt 1358
domestic well owner shall post a five thousand dollar bond with 1359
the division prior to the assignment or transfer of the well to 1360
ensure that the well will be properly plugged. The chief, for 1361
good cause, may modify the requirements of this section 1362
governing the assignment or transfer of the interests of a well 1363
to the landowner. Upon the assignment or transfer of the well, 1364
the owner of an exempt domestic well is not subject to the 1365
severance tax levied under section 5749.02 of the Revised Code, 1366
but is subject to all applicable fees established in this 1367
chapter. 1368
(C) The owner holding a permit under section 1509.05 of 1369
the Revised Code is responsible for all obligations and 1370
liabilities imposed by this chapter and any rules, orders, and 1371
terms and conditions of a permit adopted or issued under it, and 1372
no assignment or transfer by the owner relieves the owner of the 1373
obligations and liabilities until and unless the both of the 1374
following occur: 1375

section 1509.06 of the Revised Code; 1379
(2) The assignor or transferor provides or the assignee or 1380
transferee obtains liability insurance coverage required by 1381
section 1509.07 of the Revised Code, except when none is 1382
required by that section; and executes . 1383
(D) Upon assignment or transfer, the assignee or 1384
transferee shall execute and files file a surety bond, 1385
negotiable certificates of deposit or irrevocable letters of 1386
credit, or cash, as described in that section 1509.07 of the 1387
Revised Code. Instead of a bond, but only upon acceptance by the 1388
chief, the assignee or transferee may file proof of financial 1389
responsibility, described in that section 1509.07 of the Revised 1390
Code. Section 1509.071 of the Revised Code applies to the surety 1391
bond, cash, and negotiable certificates of deposit and 1392
irrevocable letters of credit described in this section. Unless 1393
the chief approves a modification, each assignee or transferee 1394
shall operate in accordance with the plans and information filed 1395
by the permit holder pursuant to section 1509.06 of the Revised 1396
Code. 1397
(D)(E) If a mortgaged property that is being foreclosed is 1398
subject to an oil or gas lease, pipeline agreement, or other 1399
instrument related to the production or sale of oil or natural 1400
gas and the lease, agreement, or other instrument was recorded 1401
subsequent to the mortgage, and if the lease, agreement, or 1402
other instrument is not in default, the oil or gas lease, 1403
pipeline agreement, or other instrument, as applicable, has 1404
priority over all other liens, claims, or encumbrances on the 1405
