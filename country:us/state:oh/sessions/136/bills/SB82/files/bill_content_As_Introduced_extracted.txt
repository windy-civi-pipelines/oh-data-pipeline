(B)(1) Upon request by any person and subject to division 541
(B)(8) of this section, all public records responsive to the 542
request shall be promptly prepared and made available for 543
inspection to the requester at all reasonable times during 544
regular business hours. Subject to division (B)(8) of this 545

Section 30:
section, upon request by any person, a public office or person 546
responsible for public records shall make copies of the 547
requested public record available to the requester at cost and 548
within a reasonable period of time. If a public record contains 549
information that is exempt from the duty to permit public 550
inspection or to copy the public record, the public office or 551
the person responsible for the public record shall make 552
available all of the information within the public record that 553
is not exempt. When making that public record available for 554
public inspection or copying that public record, the public 555
office or the person responsible for the public record shall 556
notify the requester of any redaction or make the redaction 557
plainly visible. A redaction shall be deemed a denial of a 558
request to inspect or copy the redacted information, except if 559
federal or state law authorizes or requires a public office to 560
make the redaction. When the auditor of state receives a request 561
to inspect or to make a copy of a record that was provided to 562
the auditor of state for purposes of an audit, but the original 563
public office has asserted to the auditor of state that the 564
record is not a public record, the auditor of state may handle 565
the requests by directing the requestor to the original public 566
office that provided the record to the auditor of state. 567

(2) To facilitate broader access to public records, a 568
public office or the person responsible for public records shall 569
organize and maintain public records in a manner that they can 570
be made available for inspection or copying in accordance with 571
division (B) of this section. A public office also shall have 572
available a copy of its current records retention schedule at a 573
location readily available to the public. If a requester makes 574
an ambiguous or overly broad request or has difficulty in making 575
a request for copies or inspection of public records under this 576

Section 31:
section such that the public office or the person responsible 577
for the requested public record cannot reasonably identify what 578
public records are being requested, the public office or the 579
person responsible for the requested public record may deny the 580
request but shall provide the requester with an opportunity to 581
revise the request by informing the requester of the manner in 582
which records are maintained by the public office and accessed 583
in the ordinary course of the public office's or person's 584
duties. 585
(3) If a request is ultimately denied, in part or in 586
whole, the public office or the person responsible for the 587
requested public record shall provide the requester with an 588
explanation, including legal authority, setting forth why the 589
request was denied. If the initial request was provided in 590
writing, the explanation also shall be provided to the requester 591
in writing. The explanation shall not preclude the public office 592
or the person responsible for the requested public record from 593
relying upon additional reasons or legal authority in defending 594
an action commenced under division (C) of this section. 595
(4) Unless specifically required or authorized by state or 596
federal law or in accordance with division (B) of this section, 597
no public office or person responsible for public records may 598
S. B. No. 82 Page 22
As Introduced
limit or condition the availability of public records by 599
requiring disclosure of the requester's identity or the intended 600
use of the requested public record. Any requirement that the 601
requester disclose the requester's identity or the intended use 602
of the requested public record constitutes a denial of the 603
request. 604
(5) A public office or person responsible for public 605
records may ask a requester to make the request in writing, may 606
ask for the requester's identity, and may inquire about the 607
intended use of the information requested, but may do so only 608
after disclosing to the requester that a written request is not 609
mandatory, that the requester may decline to reveal the 610
requester's identity or the intended use, and when a written 611
request or disclosure of the identity or intended use would 612
benefit the requester by enhancing the ability of the public 613
office or person responsible for public records to identify, 614
locate, or deliver the public records sought by the requester. 615
(6) If any person requests a copy of a public record in 616
accordance with division (B) of this section, the public office 617
or person responsible for the public record may require the 618
requester to pay in advance the cost involved in providing the 619
copy of the public record in accordance with the choice made by 620
the requester under this division. The public office or the 621
person responsible for the public record shall permit the 622
requester to choose to have the public record duplicated upon 623
paper, upon the same medium upon which the public office or 624
person responsible for the public record keeps it, or upon any 625
other medium upon which the public office or person responsible 626
for the public record determines that it reasonably can be 627
duplicated as an integral part of the normal operations of the 628
public office or person responsible for the public record. When 629
S. B. No. 82 Page 23
As Introduced
the requester makes a choice under this division, the public 630
office or person responsible for the public record shall provide 631
a copy of it in accordance with the choice made by the 632
requester. Nothing in this section requires a public office or 633
person responsible for the public record to allow the requester 634
of a copy of the public record to make the copies of the public 635
record. 636
(7)(a) Upon a request made in accordance with division (B) 637
of this section and subject to division (B)(6) of this section, 638
a public office or person responsible for public records shall 639
transmit a copy of a public record to any person by United 640
States mail or by any other means of delivery or transmission 641
within a reasonable period of time after receiving the request 642
for the copy. The public office or person responsible for the 643
public record may require the person making the request to pay 644
in advance the cost of postage if the copy is transmitted by 645
United States mail or the cost of delivery if the copy is 646
transmitted other than by United States mail, and to pay in 647
advance the costs incurred for other supplies used in the 648
mailing, delivery, or transmission. 649
(b) Any public office may adopt a policy and procedures 650
that it will follow in transmitting, within a reasonable period 651
of time after receiving a request, copies of public records by 652
United States mail or by any other means of delivery or 653
transmission pursuant to division (B)(7) of this section. A 654
public office that adopts a policy and procedures under division 655
(B)(7) of this section shall comply with them in performing its 656
duties under that division. 657
(c) In any policy and procedures adopted under division 658
(B)(7) of this section: 659

(i) A public office may limit the number of records 660
requested by a person that the office will physically deliver by 661
United States mail or by another delivery service to ten per 662

the person does not intend to use or forward the requested 664
records, or the information contained in them, for commercial 665
purposes; 666
(ii) A public office that chooses to provide some or all 667
of its public records on a web site that is fully accessible to 668
and searchable by members of the public at all times, other than 669
during acts of God outside the public office's control or 670
maintenance, and that charges no fee to search, access, 671
download, or otherwise receive records provided on the web site, 672
may limit to ten per month the number of records requested by a 673
person that the office will deliver in a digital format, unless 674
the requested records are not provided on the web site and 675
unless the person certifies to the office in writing that the 676
person does not intend to use or forward the requested records, 677
or the information contained in them, for commercial purposes. 678
(iii) For purposes of division (B)(7) of this section, 679
"commercial" shall be narrowly construed and does not include 680
reporting or gathering news, reporting or gathering information 681
to assist citizen oversight or understanding of the operation or 682
activities of government, or nonprofit educational research. 683
(8) A public office or person responsible for public 684

inspect or to obtain a copy of any public record concerning a 687
criminal investigation or prosecution or concerning what would 688
be a criminal investigation or prosecution if the subject of the 689

investigation or prosecution were an adult, unless the request 690
to inspect or to obtain a copy of the record is for the purpose 691
of acquiring information that is subject to release as a public 692
record under this section and the judge who imposed the sentence 693
or made the adjudication with respect to the person, or the 694
judge's successor in office, finds that the information sought 695
in the public record is necessary to support what appears to be 696
a justiciable claim of the person. 697

journalist, a public office, or person responsible for public 699
records, having custody of the records of the agency employing a 700
specified designated public service worker shall disclose to the 701
journalist the address of the actual personal residence of the 702
designated public service worker and, if the designated public 703
service worker's spouse, former spouse, or child is employed by 704
a public office, the name and address of the employer of the 705
designated public service worker's spouse, former spouse, or 706
child. The request shall include the journalist's name and title 707
and the name and address of the journalist's employer and shall 708
state that disclosure of the information sought would be in the 709
public interest. 710
(b) Division (B)(9)(a) of this section also applies to 711
journalist requests for: 712
(i) Customer information maintained by a municipally owned 713

of a public office or the person responsible for public records 737
to promptly prepare a public record and to make it available to 738
the person for inspection in accordance with division (B) of 739
this section or by any other failure of a public office or the 740
person responsible for public records to comply with an 741
obligation in accordance with division (B) of this section, the 742
person allegedly aggrieved may do only one of the following, and 743

awards court costs and reasonable attorney's fees to the person 751
that instituted the mandamus action, and, if applicable, that 752
includes an order fixing statutory damages under division (C)(2) 753
of this section. The mandamus action may be commenced in the 754
court of common pleas of the county in which division (B) of 755
this section allegedly was not complied with, in the supreme 756
court pursuant to its original jurisdiction under Section 2 of 757
Article IV, Ohio Constitution, or in the court of appeals for 758
the appellate district in which division (B) of this section 759
allegedly was not complied with pursuant to its original 760
jurisdiction under Section 3 of Article IV, Ohio Constitution. 761
(2) If a requester transmits a written request by hand 762
delivery, electronic submission, or certified mail to inspect or 763
receive copies of any public record in a manner that fairly 764
describes the public record or class of public records to the 765
public office or person responsible for the requested public 766
records, except as otherwise provided in this section, the 767
requester shall be entitled to recover the amount of statutory 768
damages set forth in this division if a court determines that 769
the public office or the person responsible for public records 770
failed to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 771
(B) of this section. 772
The amount of statutory damages shall be fixed at one 773
hundred dollars for each business day during which the public 774
office or person responsible for the requested public records 775
failed to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 776
(B) of this section, beginning with the day on which the 777

up to a maximum of one thousand dollars. The award of statutory 779
S. B. No. 82 Page 28

damages shall not be construed as a penalty, but as compensation 780
for injury arising from lost use of the requested information. 781
The existence of this injury shall be conclusively presumed. The 782
award of statutory damages shall be in addition to all other 783
remedies authorized by this section. 784
The court may reduce an award of statutory damages or not 785
award statutory damages if the court determines both of the 786
following: 787
(a) That, based on the ordinary application of statutory 788
law and case law as it existed at the time of the conduct or 789
threatened conduct of the public office or person responsible 790
for the requested public records that allegedly constitutes a 791
failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 792
(B) of this section and that was the basis of the mandamus 793
action, a well-informed public office or person responsible for 794
the requested public records reasonably would believe that the 795
conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or person 796
responsible for the requested public records did not constitute 797
a failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with 798
division (B) of this section; 799
(b) That a well-informed public office or person 800
responsible for the requested public records reasonably would 801
believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of the public 802
office or person responsible for the requested public records 803
would serve the public policy that underlies the authority that 804
is asserted as permitting that conduct or threatened conduct. 805
(3) In a mandamus action filed under division (C)(1) of 806
this section, the following apply: 807
(a)(i) If the court orders the public office or the person 808
S. B. No. 82 Page 29
As Introduced
responsible for the public record to comply with division (B) of 809
this section, the court shall determine and award to the relator 810
all court costs, which shall be construed as remedial and not 811
punitive. 812
(ii) If the court makes a determination described in 813
division (C)(3)(b)(iii) of this section, the court shall 814
determine and award to the relator all court costs, which shall 815
be construed as remedial and not punitive. 816
(b) If the court renders a judgment that orders the public 817
office or the person responsible for the public record to comply 818
with division (B) of this section or if the court determines any 819
of the following, the court may award reasonable attorney's fees 820
to the relator, subject to division (C)(4) of this section: 821
(i) The public office or the person responsible for the 822
public records failed to respond affirmatively or negatively to 823
the public records request in accordance with the time allowed 824
under division (B) of this section. 825
(ii) The public office or the person responsible for the 826
public records promised to permit the relator to inspect or 827
receive copies of the public records requested within a 828
specified period of time but failed to fulfill that promise 829
within that specified period of time. 830
(iii) The public office or the person responsible for the 831
public records acted in bad faith when the office or person 832
voluntarily made the public records available to the relator for 833
the first time after the relator commenced the mandamus action, 834
but before the court issued any order concluding whether or not 835
the public office or person was required to comply with division 836
(B) of this section. No discovery may be conducted on the issue 837
S. B. No. 82 Page 30
As Introduced
of the alleged bad faith of the public office or person 838
responsible for the public records. This division shall not be 839
construed as creating a presumption that the public office or 840
the person responsible for the public records acted in bad faith 841
when the office or person voluntarily made the public records 842
available to the relator for the first time after the relator 843
commenced the mandamus action, but before the court issued any 844
order described in this division. 845
(c) The court shall not award attorney's fees to the 846
relator if the court determines both of the following: 847
(i) That, based on the ordinary application of statutory 848
law and case law as it existed at the time of the conduct or 849
threatened conduct of the public office or person responsible 850
for the requested public records that allegedly constitutes a 851
failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 852
(B) of this section and that was the basis of the mandamus 853
action, a well-informed public office or person responsible for 854
the requested public records reasonably would believe that the 855
conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or person 856
responsible for the requested public records did not constitute 857
a failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with 858
division (B) of this section; 859
(ii) That a well-informed public office or person 860
responsible for the requested public records reasonably would 861
believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of the public 862
office or person responsible for the requested public records 863
would serve the public policy that underlies the authority that 864
is asserted as permitting that conduct or threatened conduct. 865
(4) All of the following apply to any award of reasonable 866
attorney's fees awarded under division (C)(3)(b) of this 867
S. B. No. 82 Page 31
As Introduced

Section 33:
section: 868
(a) The fees shall be construed as remedial and not 869
punitive. 870
(b) The fees awarded shall not exceed the total of the 871
reasonable attorney's fees incurred before the public record was 872
made available to the relator and the fees described in division 873
(C)(4)(c) of this section. 874
(c) Reasonable attorney's fees shall include reasonable 875
fees incurred to produce proof of the reasonableness and amount 876
of the fees and to otherwise litigate entitlement to the fees. 877
(d) The court may reduce the amount of fees awarded if the 878
court determines that, given the factual circumstances involved 879
with the specific public records request, an alternative means 880
should have been pursued to more effectively and efficiently 881
resolve the dispute that was subject to the mandamus action 882
filed under division (C)(1) of this section. 883
(5) If the court does not issue a writ of mandamus under 884
division (C) of this section and the court determines at that 885
time that the bringing of the mandamus action was frivolous 886
conduct as defined in division (A) of section 2323.51 of the 887
Revised Code, the court may award to the public office all court 888
costs, expenses, and reasonable attorney's fees, as determined 889
by the court. 890
(D) Chapter 1347. of the Revised Code does not limit the 891
provisions of this section. 892
(E)(1) To ensure that all employees of public offices are 893

criminal proceeding that was dismissed or for which a judgment 993

complaint with the clerk of the court of claims pursuant to 1001

Section 36:
section 2743.75 of the Revised Code, requesting the court to 1002
order the release of all or portions of the recording. If the 1003
court considering the request determines that the filing 1004
articulates by clear and convincing evidence that the public 1005
interest in the recording substantially outweighs privacy 1006
interests and other interests asserted to deny release, the 1007
court shall order the public office to release the recording. 1008

Section 37:
Section 2. That existing section 149.43 of the Revised 1009
Code is hereby repealed. 1010

regular business hours. Subject to division (B)(8) of this 545
section, upon request by any person, a public office or person 546
responsible for public records shall make copies of the 547
requested public record available to the requester at cost and 548
within a reasonable period of time. If a public record contains 549
information that is exempt from the duty to permit public 550
inspection or to copy the public record, the public office or 551
the person responsible for the public record shall make 552
available all of the information within the public record that 553
is not exempt. When making that public record available for 554
public inspection or copying that public record, the public 555
office or the person responsible for the public record shall 556
notify the requester of any redaction or make the redaction 557
plainly visible. A redaction shall be deemed a denial of a 558
request to inspect or copy the redacted information, except if 559
federal or state law authorizes or requires a public office to 560

public office or the person responsible for public records shall 569
organize and maintain public records in a manner that they can 570
be made available for inspection or copying in accordance with 571
division (B) of this section. A public office also shall have 572
available a copy of its current records retention schedule at a 573
location readily available to the public. If a requester makes 574
an ambiguous or overly broad request or has difficulty in making 575
a request for copies or inspection of public records under this 576
section such that the public office or the person responsible 577
for the requested public record cannot reasonably identify what 578
public records are being requested, the public office or the 579
person responsible for the requested public record may deny the 580
request but shall provide the requester with an opportunity to 581
revise the request by informing the requester of the manner in 582
which records are maintained by the public office and accessed 583
in the ordinary course of the public office's or person's 584
duties. 585
(3) If a request is ultimately denied, in part or in 586
whole, the public office or the person responsible for the 587
requested public record shall provide the requester with an 588
explanation, including legal authority, setting forth why the 589
request was denied. If the initial request was provided in 590
writing, the explanation also shall be provided to the requester 591
in writing. The explanation shall not preclude the public office 592
or the person responsible for the requested public record from 593
relying upon additional reasons or legal authority in defending 594
an action commenced under division (C) of this section. 595
(4) Unless specifically required or authorized by state or 596
federal law or in accordance with division (B) of this section, 597
no public office or person responsible for public records may 598

S. B. No. 82 Page 22
As Introduced
limit or condition the availability of public records by 599
requiring disclosure of the requester's identity or the intended 600
use of the requested public record. Any requirement that the 601
requester disclose the requester's identity or the intended use 602
of the requested public record constitutes a denial of the 603
request. 604
(5) A public office or person responsible for public 605
records may ask a requester to make the request in writing, may 606
ask for the requester's identity, and may inquire about the 607
intended use of the information requested, but may do so only 608
after disclosing to the requester that a written request is not 609
mandatory, that the requester may decline to reveal the 610
requester's identity or the intended use, and when a written 611
request or disclosure of the identity or intended use would 612
benefit the requester by enhancing the ability of the public 613
office or person responsible for public records to identify, 614
locate, or deliver the public records sought by the requester. 615
(6) If any person requests a copy of a public record in 616
accordance with division (B) of this section, the public office 617
or person responsible for the public record may require the 618
requester to pay in advance the cost involved in providing the 619
copy of the public record in accordance with the choice made by 620
the requester under this division. The public office or the 621
person responsible for the public record shall permit the 622
requester to choose to have the public record duplicated upon 623
paper, upon the same medium upon which the public office or 624
person responsible for the public record keeps it, or upon any 625
other medium upon which the public office or person responsible 626
for the public record determines that it reasonably can be 627
duplicated as an integral part of the normal operations of the 628
public office or person responsible for the public record. When 629

S. B. No. 82 Page 23
As Introduced
the requester makes a choice under this division, the public 630
office or person responsible for the public record shall provide 631
a copy of it in accordance with the choice made by the 632
requester. Nothing in this section requires a public office or 633
person responsible for the public record to allow the requester 634
of a copy of the public record to make the copies of the public 635
record. 636
(7)(a) Upon a request made in accordance with division (B) 637
of this section and subject to division (B)(6) of this section, 638
a public office or person responsible for public records shall 639
transmit a copy of a public record to any person by United 640
States mail or by any other means of delivery or transmission 641
within a reasonable period of time after receiving the request 642
for the copy. The public office or person responsible for the 643
public record may require the person making the request to pay 644
in advance the cost of postage if the copy is transmitted by 645
United States mail or the cost of delivery if the copy is 646
transmitted other than by United States mail, and to pay in 647
advance the costs incurred for other supplies used in the 648
mailing, delivery, or transmission. 649
(b) Any public office may adopt a policy and procedures 650
that it will follow in transmitting, within a reasonable period 651
of time after receiving a request, copies of public records by 652
United States mail or by any other means of delivery or 653
transmission pursuant to division (B)(7) of this section. A 654
public office that adopts a policy and procedures under division 655
(B)(7) of this section shall comply with them in performing its 656
duties under that division. 657

download, or otherwise receive records provided on the web site, 672
may limit to ten per month the number of records requested by a 673
person that the office will deliver in a digital format, unless 674

S. B. No. 82 Page 25
As Introduced

or made the adjudication with respect to the person, or the 694
judge's successor in office, finds that the information sought 695

a justiciable claim of the person. 697
(9)(a) Upon written request made and signed by a 698
journalist, a public office, or person responsible for public 699
records, having custody of the records of the agency employing a 700

gathering, processing, transmitting, compiling, editing, or 727
disseminating information for the general public. 728
(10) Upon a request made by a victim, victim's attorney, 729
or victim's representative, as that term is used in section 730
2930.02 of the Revised Code, a public office or person 731
responsible for public records shall transmit a copy of a 732
depiction of the victim as described in division (A)(1)(ii) of 733
this section to the victim, victim's attorney, or victim's 734
representative. 735
(C)(1) If a person allegedly is aggrieved by the failure 736
of a public office or the person responsible for public records 737
to promptly prepare a public record and to make it available to 738
the person for inspection in accordance with division (B) of 739
this section or by any other failure of a public office or the 740
person responsible for public records to comply with an 741
obligation in accordance with division (B) of this section, the 742
person allegedly aggrieved may do only one of the following, and 743
not both: 744
(a) File a complaint with the clerk of the court of claims 745
or the clerk of the court of common pleas under section 2743.75 746
of the Revised Code; 747
(b) Commence a mandamus action to obtain a judgment that 748

S. B. No. 82 Page 27
As Introduced
orders the public office or the person responsible for the 749

awards court costs and reasonable attorney's fees to the person 751
that instituted the mandamus action, and, if applicable, that 752
includes an order fixing statutory damages under division (C)(2) 753
of this section. The mandamus action may be commenced in the 754
court of common pleas of the county in which division (B) of 755
this section allegedly was not complied with, in the supreme 756
court pursuant to its original jurisdiction under Section 2 of 757
Article IV, Ohio Constitution, or in the court of appeals for 758
the appellate district in which division (B) of this section 759
allegedly was not complied with pursuant to its original 760
jurisdiction under Section 3 of Article IV, Ohio Constitution. 761
(2) If a requester transmits a written request by hand 762
delivery, electronic submission, or certified mail to inspect or 763
receive copies of any public record in a manner that fairly 764
describes the public record or class of public records to the 765
public office or person responsible for the requested public 766
records, except as otherwise provided in this section, the 767
requester shall be entitled to recover the amount of statutory 768
damages set forth in this division if a court determines that 769
the public office or the person responsible for public records 770
failed to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 771
(B) of this section. 772
The amount of statutory damages shall be fixed at one 773
hundred dollars for each business day during which the public 774
office or person responsible for the requested public records 775
failed to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 776
(B) of this section, beginning with the day on which the 777
requester files a mandamus action to recover statutory damages, 778
up to a maximum of one thousand dollars. The award of statutory 779

S. B. No. 82 Page 28
As Introduced
damages shall not be construed as a penalty, but as compensation 780
for injury arising from lost use of the requested information. 781
The existence of this injury shall be conclusively presumed. The 782
award of statutory damages shall be in addition to all other 783
remedies authorized by this section. 784
The court may reduce an award of statutory damages or not 785
award statutory damages if the court determines both of the 786
following: 787
(a) That, based on the ordinary application of statutory 788
law and case law as it existed at the time of the conduct or 789
threatened conduct of the public office or person responsible 790
for the requested public records that allegedly constitutes a 791
failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 792
(B) of this section and that was the basis of the mandamus 793
action, a well-informed public office or person responsible for 794
the requested public records reasonably would believe that the 795
conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or person 796
responsible for the requested public records did not constitute 797
a failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with 798
division (B) of this section; 799
(b) That a well-informed public office or person 800
responsible for the requested public records reasonably would 801
believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of the public 802
office or person responsible for the requested public records 803
would serve the public policy that underlies the authority that 804
is asserted as permitting that conduct or threatened conduct. 805
(3) In a mandamus action filed under division (C)(1) of 806
this section, the following apply: 807
(a)(i) If the court orders the public office or the person 808

S. B. No. 82 Page 29
As Introduced
responsible for the public record to comply with division (B) of 809
this section, the court shall determine and award to the relator 810
all court costs, which shall be construed as remedial and not 811
punitive. 812
(ii) If the court makes a determination described in 813
division (C)(3)(b)(iii) of this section, the court shall 814
determine and award to the relator all court costs, which shall 815
be construed as remedial and not punitive. 816
(b) If the court renders a judgment that orders the public 817
office or the person responsible for the public record to comply 818
with division (B) of this section or if the court determines any 819
of the following, the court may award reasonable attorney's fees 820
to the relator, subject to division (C)(4) of this section: 821
(i) The public office or the person responsible for the 822
public records failed to respond affirmatively or negatively to 823
the public records request in accordance with the time allowed 824
under division (B) of this section. 825
(ii) The public office or the person responsible for the 826
public records promised to permit the relator to inspect or 827
receive copies of the public records requested within a 828
specified period of time but failed to fulfill that promise 829
within that specified period of time. 830
(iii) The public office or the person responsible for the 831
public records acted in bad faith when the office or person 832
voluntarily made the public records available to the relator for 833
the first time after the relator commenced the mandamus action, 834
but before the court issued any order concluding whether or not 835
the public office or person was required to comply with division 836
(B) of this section. No discovery may be conducted on the issue 837

S. B. No. 82 Page 30
As Introduced
of the alleged bad faith of the public office or person 838
responsible for the public records. This division shall not be 839
construed as creating a presumption that the public office or 840
the person responsible for the public records acted in bad faith 841
when the office or person voluntarily made the public records 842
available to the relator for the first time after the relator 843
commenced the mandamus action, but before the court issued any 844
order described in this division. 845
(c) The court shall not award attorney's fees to the 846
relator if the court determines both of the following: 847
(i) That, based on the ordinary application of statutory 848
law and case law as it existed at the time of the conduct or 849
threatened conduct of the public office or person responsible 850
for the requested public records that allegedly constitutes a 851
failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 852
(B) of this section and that was the basis of the mandamus 853
action, a well-informed public office or person responsible for 854
the requested public records reasonably would believe that the 855
conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or person 856
responsible for the requested public records did not constitute 857
a failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with 858
division (B) of this section; 859
(ii) That a well-informed public office or person 860
responsible for the requested public records reasonably would 861
believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of the public 862
office or person responsible for the requested public records 863
would serve the public policy that underlies the authority that 864
is asserted as permitting that conduct or threatened conduct. 865
(4) All of the following apply to any award of reasonable 866
attorney's fees awarded under division (C)(3)(b) of this 867

S. B. No. 82 Page 31
As Introduced
section: 868
(a) The fees shall be construed as remedial and not 869
punitive. 870
(b) The fees awarded shall not exceed the total of the 871
reasonable attorney's fees incurred before the public record was 872
made available to the relator and the fees described in division 873
(C)(4)(c) of this section. 874
(c) Reasonable attorney's fees shall include reasonable 875
fees incurred to produce proof of the reasonableness and amount 876
of the fees and to otherwise litigate entitlement to the fees. 877
(d) The court may reduce the amount of fees awarded if the 878
court determines that, given the factual circumstances involved 879
with the specific public records request, an alternative means 880
should have been pursued to more effectively and efficiently 881
resolve the dispute that was subject to the mandamus action 882
filed under division (C)(1) of this section. 883
(5) If the court does not issue a writ of mandamus under 884
division (C) of this section and the court determines at that 885
time that the bringing of the mandamus action was frivolous 886
conduct as defined in division (A) of section 2323.51 of the 887
Revised Code, the court may award to the public office all court 888
costs, expenses, and reasonable attorney's fees, as determined 889
by the court. 890
(D) Chapter 1347. of the Revised Code does not limit the 891
provisions of this section. 892
(E)(1) To ensure that all employees of public offices are 893
appropriately educated about a public office's obligations under 894
division (B) of this section, all elected officials or their 895
appropriate designees shall attend training approved by the 896

S. B. No. 82 Page 32
As Introduced
attorney general as provided in section 109.43 of the Revised 897
Code. A future official may satisfy the requirements of this 898
division by attending the training before taking office, 899
provided that the future official may not send a designee in the 900
future official's place. 901
(2) All public offices shall adopt a public records policy 902
in compliance with this section for responding to public records 903
requests. In adopting a public records policy under this 904
division, a public office may obtain guidance from the model 905
public records policy developed and provided to the public 906
office by the attorney general under section 109.43 of the 907
Revised Code. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the 908
policy may not limit the number of public records that the 909
public office will make available to a single person, may not 910
limit the number of public records that it will make available 911
during a fixed period of time, and may not establish a fixed 912
period of time before it will respond to a request for 913
inspection or copying of public records, unless that period is 914
less than eight hours. 915
The public office shall distribute the public records 916
policy adopted by the public office under this division to the 917
employee of the public office who is the records custodian or 918
records manager or otherwise has custody of the records of that 919
office. The public office shall require that employee to 920
acknowledge receipt of the copy of the public records policy. 921
The public office shall create a poster that describes its 922
public records policy and shall post the poster in a conspicuous 923
place in the public office and in all locations where the public 924
office has branch offices. The public office may post its public 925
records policy on the internet web site of the public office if 926
the public office maintains an internet web site. A public 927

S. B. No. 82 Page 33
As Introduced
office that has established a manual or handbook of its general 928
policies and procedures for all employees of the public office 929
shall include the public records policy of the public office in 930
the manual or handbook. 931
(F)(1) The bureau of motor vehicles may adopt rules 932
pursuant to Chapter 119. of the Revised Code to reasonably limit 933
the number of bulk commercial special extraction requests made 934
by a person for the same records or for updated records during a 935
calendar year. The rules may include provisions for charges to 936
be made for bulk commercial special extraction requests for the 937
actual cost of the bureau, plus special extraction costs, plus 938
ten per cent. The bureau may charge for expenses for redacting 939
information, the release of which is prohibited by law. 940
(2) As used in division (F)(1) of this section: 941
(a) "Actual cost" means the cost of depleted supplies, 942
records storage media costs, actual mailing and alternative 943
delivery costs, or other transmitting costs, and any direct 944
equipment operating and maintenance costs, including actual 945
costs paid to private contractors for copying services. 946
(b) "Bulk commercial special extraction request" means a 947
request for copies of a record for information in a format other 948
than the format already available, or information that cannot be 949
extracted without examination of all items in a records series, 950
class of records, or database by a person who intends to use or 951
forward the copies for surveys, marketing, solicitation, or 952
resale for commercial purposes. "Bulk commercial special 953
extraction request" does not include a request by a person who 954
gives assurance to the bureau that the person making the request 955
does not intend to use or forward the requested copies for 956
surveys, marketing, solicitation, or resale for commercial 957

S. B. No. 82 Page 34
As Introduced
purposes. 958
(c) "Commercial" means profit-seeking production, buying, 959
or selling of any good, service, or other product. 960
(d) "Special extraction costs" means the cost of the time 961
spent by the lowest paid employee competent to perform the task, 962

by the bureau, or the actual cost incurred to create computer 964
programs to make the special extraction. "Special extraction 965
costs" include any charges paid to a public agency for computer 966
or records services. 967
(3) For purposes of divisions (F)(1) and (2) of this 968
section, "surveys, marketing, solicitation, or resale for 969
commercial purposes" shall be narrowly construed and does not 970
include reporting or gathering news, reporting or gathering 971
information to assist citizen oversight or understanding of the 972
operation or activities of government, or nonprofit educational 973
research. 974
(G) A request by a defendant, counsel of a defendant, or 975
any agent of a defendant in a criminal action that public 976
records related to that action be made available under this 977
section shall be considered a demand for discovery pursuant to 978
the Criminal Rules, except to the extent that the Criminal Rules 979
plainly indicate a contrary intent. The defendant, counsel of 980
the defendant, or agent of the defendant making a request under 981
this division shall serve a copy of the request on the 982
prosecuting attorney, director of law, or other chief legal 983
officer responsible for prosecuting the action. 984
(H)(1) Any portion of a body-worn camera or dashboard 985
camera recording described in divisions (A)(17)(b) to (h) of 986

S. B. No. 82 Page 35
As Introduced
this section may be released by consent of the subject of the 987
recording or a representative of that person, as specified in 988
those divisions, only if either of the following applies: 989
(a) The recording will not be used in connection with any 990
probable or pending criminal proceedings; 991
(b) The recording has been used in connection with a 992
criminal proceeding that was dismissed or for which a judgment 993
has been entered pursuant to Rule 32 of the Rules of Criminal 994
Procedure, and will not be used again in connection with any 995
probable or pending criminal proceedings. 996
(2) If a public office denies a request to release a 997
restricted portion of a body-worn camera or dashboard camera 998
recording, as defined in division (A)(17) of this section, any 999
person may file a mandamus action pursuant to this section or a 1000
complaint with the clerk of the court of claims pursuant to 1001
section 2743.75 of the Revised Code, requesting the court to 1002
order the release of all or portions of the recording. If the 1003
court considering the request determines that the filing 1004
articulates by clear and convincing evidence that the public 1005
interest in the recording substantially outweighs privacy 1006
interests and other interests asserted to deny release, the 1007
court shall order the public office to release the recording. 1008
Section 2. That existing section 149.43 of the Revised 1009
Code is hereby repealed. 1010
