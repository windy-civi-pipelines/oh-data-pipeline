spouse, and dependents. No deduction for medical care insurance 70
under division (A)(10)(a) of this section shall be allowed 71
either to any taxpayer who is eligible to participate in any 72
subsidized health plan maintained by any employer of the 73
taxpayer or of the taxpayer's spouse, or to any taxpayer who is 74

dependents, to the extent the expenses exceed seven and one-half 89
per cent of the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income. 90
(c) For purposes of division (A)(10) of this section, 91

of the Internal Revenue Code. Solely for purposes of division 96
(A)(10)(a) of this section, "dependent" includes a person who 97
otherwise would be a "qualifying relative" and thus a 98
"dependent" under section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code but 99
for the fact that the person fails to meet the income and 100
support limitations under section 152(d)(1)(B) and (C) of the 101

States department of the treasury regulations. The deduction 108
otherwise allowed under division (A)(11)(a) of this section 109

S. B. No. 261 Page 5

shall be reduced to the extent the reimbursement is attributable 110
to an amount the taxpayer deducted under this section in any 111
taxable year. 112
(b) Add any amount not otherwise included in Ohio adjusted 113
gross income for any taxable year to the extent that the amount 114
is attributable to the recovery during the taxable year of any 115
amount deducted or excluded in computing federal or Ohio 116
adjusted gross income in any taxable year. 117
(12) Deduct any portion of the deduction described in 118
section 1341(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, for repaying 119
previously reported income received under a claim of right, that 120
meets both of the following requirements: 121
(a) It is allowable for repayment of an item that was 122
included in the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for a prior 123
taxable year and did not qualify for a credit under division (A) 124
or (B) of section 5747.05 of the Revised Code for that year; 125
(b) It does not otherwise reduce the taxpayer's adjusted 126
gross income for the current or any other taxable year. 127
(13) Deduct an amount equal to the deposits made to, and 128
net investment earnings of, a medical savings account during the 129
taxable year, in accordance with section 3924.66 of the Revised 130
Code. The deduction allowed by division (A)(13) of this section 131
does not apply to medical savings account deposits and earnings 132
otherwise deducted or excluded for the current or any other 133
taxable year from the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income. 134

medical savings account during the taxable year, and the net 136
investment earnings on those funds, when the funds withdrawn 137
were used for any purpose other than to reimburse an account 138

Code during the taxable year. 143
(15) Add any amount claimed as a credit under section 144
5747.059 of the Revised Code to the extent that such amount 145
satisfies either of the following: 146
(a) The amount was deducted or excluded from the 147
computation of the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income as 148
required to be reported for the taxpayer's taxable year under 149
the Internal Revenue Code; 150
(b) The amount resulted in a reduction of the taxpayer's 151
federal adjusted gross income as required to be reported for any 152
of the taxpayer's taxable years under the Internal Revenue Code. 153
(16) Deduct the amount contributed by the taxpayer to an 154
individual development account program established by a county 155
department of job and family services pursuant to sections 156
329.11 to 329.14 of the Revised Code for the purpose of matching 157
funds deposited by program participants. On request of the tax 158
commissioner, the taxpayer shall provide any information that, 159
in the tax commissioner's opinion, is necessary to establish the 160
amount deducted under division (A)(16) of this section. 161

expense allowed by subsection (k) of section 168 of the Internal 199
Revenue Code and by qualifying section 179 depreciation expense, 200

proportionate share of the pass-through entity's physical assets 1031
which the pass-through entity directly or indirectly owns on the 1032
last day of the pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year 1033

upper level pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year in 1053

lower level pass-through entity and if, based upon clear and 1055
convincing evidence, complete information about the location and 1056
cost of the physical assets of the lower pass-through entity is 1057
not available to the upper level pass-through entity, then 1058
solely for purposes of ascertaining if a gain or loss 1059
constitutes a qualifying trust amount, the upper level pass- 1060
through entity shall be deemed as owning no equity of the lower 1061
level pass-through entity for each day during the upper level 1062
pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year in which or with 1063
which ends the lower level pass-through entity's calendar or 1064
