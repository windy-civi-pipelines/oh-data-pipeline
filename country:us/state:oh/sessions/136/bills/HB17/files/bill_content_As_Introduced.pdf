property. 17
(B) Each separate parcel of real property shall be 18
classified by the county auditor according to its principal, 19
current use. Vacant lots and tracts of land upon which there are 20
no structures or improvements shall be classified in accordance 21
with their location and their highest and best probable legal 22
use. In the case of lands containing or producing minerals, the 23
minerals or any rights to the minerals that are listed and taxed 24

the fee of the soil and the right to the minerals are owned by 27

of this section, lands and improvements thereon used for 29
residential or agricultural purposes or as a storage condominium 30

and all other lands and improvements thereon and minerals or 32
rights to minerals shall be classified as 33
nonresidential/agricultural real property. Each year the auditor 34
shall reclassify each parcel of real property whose principal, 35
current use has changed from the preceding year to a use 36
appropriate to classification in the other class. Except as 37
otherwise provided in division (B) of section 5709.40, division 38
(B) of section 5709.41, division (A)(2) of section 5709.73, or 39

purpose of making the reductions in taxes required by section 42
319.301 of the Revised Code, and this section shall not apply 43
for purposes of classifying real property for any other purpose 44
authorized or required by law or by rule of the tax 45
commissioner. 46
The commissioner shall adopt rules governing the 47
