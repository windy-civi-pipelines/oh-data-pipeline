subject to this chapter, shall transmit to the system for each 20
contributor subsequent to the date of coverage an amount equal 21
to the applicable per cent of each contributor's earnable salary 22
at such intervals and in such form as the system shall require. 23
The head of each state department and the fiscal officer of each 24
local authority subject to this chapter shall transmit promptly 25
to the system a report of contributions at such intervals and in 26
such form as the system shall require, showing thereon all the 27
contributions and earnable salary of each contributor employed, 28
together with warrants, checks, or electronic payments covering 29
the total of such deductions. A penalty shall be added when such 30
report, together with warrants, checks, or electronic payments 31
to cover the total amount due from the earnable salary of all 32
amenable employees of such employer, is filed thirty or more 33
days after the last day of such reporting period. The system, 34
after making a record of all receipts under this division, shall 35
deposit the receipts with the treasurer of state for use as 36
provided by this chapter. 37
(C) Unless the board adopts a rule under division (D) of 38
this section, the penalty described in division (B) of this 39
section for failing to timely transmit a report, pay the total 40
amount due, or both is as follows: 41
(1) At least one but not more than ten days past due, an 42

As Introduced
The penalty described in this division shall be added to 49
and collected on the next succeeding regular employer billing. 50
Interest at a rate set by the retirement board shall be charged 51
on the amount of the penalty in case such penalty is not paid 52
within thirty days after it is added to the regular employer 53
billing. 54
(D) The board may adopt rules to establish penalties in 55
amounts that do not exceed the amounts specified in divisions 56
(C)(1) to (3) of this section. 57

required by this section, the fiscal officer of each local 59
authority subject to this chapter shall submit to the system at 60
least once each year a complete listing of all noncontributing 61
appointive employees. Where an employer fails to transmit 62
contributions to the system, the system may make a determination 63
of the employees' liability for contributions and certify to the 64
employer the amounts due for collection in the same manner as 65
payments due the employers' accumulation fund. Any amounts so 66
collected shall be held in trust pending receipt of a report of 67
contributions for such public employees for the period involved 68
as provided by law and, thereafter, the amount in trust shall be 69
transferred to the employees' savings fund to the credit of the 70
employees. Any amount remaining after the transfer to the 71
employees' savings fund shall be transferred to the employers' 72
accumulation fund as a credit of such employer. 73
(F) The fiscal officer of each local authority subject to 74
this chapter shall require each new contributor to submit to the 75
system a detailed report of all the contributor's previous 76
service as a public employee along with such other facts as the 77
board requires for the proper operation of the system. 78

for the period of absence within one year. Credit shall be 83
purchased under this division in accordance with section 145.29 84
of the Revised Code. 85
Sec. 742.31. (A) Except as provided in division (B) of 86

division (B) of section 742.14 of the Revised Code due on 101
November 1, 2017, and following each quinquennial actuarial 102
investigation thereafter, if, in consultation with the board's 103
actuary, the board determines that an adjustment to the 104
contribution rate is appropriate, the board may, in accordance 105
with rules adopted under section 742.10 of the Revised Code, do 106
either of the following: 107

H. B. No. 473 Page 5
As Introduced
(1) If the board's determination is that an increase in 108
the contribution rate is necessary to preserve the fiscal 109
integrity of the fund, increase the contribution rate; 110
(2) If the board's determination is that a decrease in the 111
contribution rate would not materially impair the fiscal 112
integrity of the fund, decrease the contribution rate. 113
(C) The contributions required under this section shall 114
not be paid by an employer on an employee's behalf, but may be 115
treated as employer contributions for purposes of state and 116
federal income tax deferred income provisions. 117
(D) The amount shall be deducted by the employer from the 118
employee's salary as defined in division (L) of section 742.01 119
of the Revised Code for each payroll period, irrespective of 120
whether the minimum compensation provided by law for the 121
employee is reduced thereby. Every employee shall be deemed to 122
consent to the deductions, and payment to the employee less the 123
deductions is a complete discharge and acquittance of all claims 124
and demands for the services rendered by the employee during the 125
period covered by such payment. 126
Sec. 3307.27. The contributions required under section 127
3307.26 of the Revised Code shall not be made by an employer on 128

rate to a rate not greater than ten per cent of compensation. 137
The contributions required under this section shall not be 138
paid by an employer on a contributor's behalf, but may be 139
treated as employer contributions for purposes of state and 140
federal income tax deferred income provisions. 141
The contributions by the direction of the school employees 142
retirement board shall be deducted by the employer from the 143
compensation of each contributor on each payroll of such 144
contributor for each payroll period and shall be an amount equal 145
to the required per cent of such contributor's compensation. On 146
a finding by the board that an employer has failed or refused to 147
deduct contributions for any employee during any year and to 148
transmit such amounts to the retirement system, the retirement 149
board may make a determination of the amount of the delinquent 150
contributions, including interest at a rate set by the 151
retirement board, from the end of each year, and certify to the 152
employer the amounts for collection. If the amount is not paid 153
by the employer, it may be certified for collection in the same 154
manner as payments due the employers' trust fund. Any amounts so 155
collected shall be held in trust pending receipt of a report of 156
contributions for the employee for the period involved as 157
provided by law and, thereafter, the amount in trust shall be 158
transferred to the employee's savings fund to the credit of the 159
employee. Any amount remaining after the transfer to the 160
employees' savings fund shall be transferred to the employers' 161
trust fund as a credit of the employer. 162
Additional deposits may be made to a member's account. At 163
retirement, the amount deposited with interest may be used to 164
provide additional annuity income. The additional deposits may 165
be refunded to the member before retirement, and shall be 166

H. B. No. 473 Page 7

refunded if the member withdraws the member's refundable amount. 167
The deposits may be refunded to the beneficiary or estate if the 168
member dies before retirement, and the board shall determine 169
whether regular interest shall be credited to deposits thus 170
refunded. 171

or terms and other conditions of employment and the 173
