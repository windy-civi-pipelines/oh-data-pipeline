(D) If a student for whom a scholarship account has been 175
established for a school year disenrolls from the student's 176
participating school and does not enroll in a different 177
participating school during that school year, the treasurer of 178
state shall transfer the balance of any funds in the student's 179
account, including any prorated refund from a participating 180
school, to the department of education and workforce. The 181
department shall distribute those funds as follows: 182
(1) If the student enrolls in a school district, community 183
school, or STEM school, the department shall distribute the 184
funds to that district or school. 185
(2) If the student enrolls in a chartered nonpublic school 186
or a nonchartered nonpublic school that is not a participating 187
school, or if the student receives home education in accordance 188
with section 3321.042 of the Revised Code, the department shall 189
distribute those funds to the student's resident district. 190
(E) If the parent of a student for whom a scholarship 191
account is established for a school year reapplies to have an 192

the treasurer of state shall, on the thirtieth day of June of 194
the school year for which the account is established, transfer 195
to the student's new account the balance of funds in the 196
student's old account. 197
(F) If the parent of a student for whom a scholarship 198

school year, the treasurer of state shall, on the thirteenth day 201
of June of the school year for which the account is established, 202
transfer the balance of any funds in the student's old account 203
to the department. The department shall distribute those funds 204
to the school district, community school, or STEM school in 205
which the students enrolls in the subsequent school year. If the 206
student has graduated high school or does not enroll in a 207
district or school, or receive a home education in accordance 208
with section 3321.042 of the Revised Code, in the subsequent 209
school year, the department shall distribute those funds to the 210
student's resident district. 211
(G) Nothing in this section prohibits the parent of a 212
student for whom a scholarship account is established from 213
making payments for the costs of educational goods and services 214
not covered by the funds in that account. However, the parent of 215
a student shall not deposit funds in the student's scholarship 216
account. 217
