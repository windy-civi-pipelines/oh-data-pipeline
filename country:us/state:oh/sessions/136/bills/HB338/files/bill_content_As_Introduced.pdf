trial, the testimony, other evidence, statement of the offender, 998
arguments of counsel, and, if applicable, the reports submitted 999
pursuant to division (D)(1) of this section, the trial jury, if 1000
the offender was tried by a jury, shall determine whether the 1001
aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of 1002
committing are sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors 1003

proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that the aggravating 1005
circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing 1006
outweigh the mitigating factors, the trial jury shall recommend 1007

an offender under division (B)(1)(f) of this section relative to 1457

convicted or to which the offender pleads guilty and, in its 1471
discretion, also may impose on the offender the prison term 1472
specified under that division for any or all of the remaining 1473

(2)(a) If division (B)(2)(b) of this section does not 1475
apply, the court may impose on an offender, in addition to the 1476
longest prison term authorized or required for the offense or, 1477

authorized or required for the offense, an additional definite 1480
prison term of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, 1481
nine, or ten years if all of the following criteria are met: 1482
(i) The offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a 1483
specification of the type described in section 2941.149 of the 1484
Revised Code that the offender is a repeat violent offender. 1485

(iv) The court finds that the prison terms imposed 1502
pursuant to division (B)(2)(a)(iii) of this section and, if 1503
applicable, division (B)(1) or (3) of this section are 1504

indicating a lesser likelihood of recidivism. 1509
(v) The court finds that the prison terms imposed pursuant 1510
to division (B)(2)(a)(iii) of this section and, if applicable, 1511
division (B)(1) or (3) of this section are demeaning to the 1512
seriousness of the offense, because one or more of the factors 1513
under section 2929.12 of the Revised Code indicating that the 1514
offender's conduct is more serious than conduct normally 1515
constituting the offense are present, and they outweigh the 1516

constituting the offense. 1519
(b) The court shall impose on an offender the longest 1520
prison term authorized or required for the offense or, for 1521

eight, nine, or ten years if all of the following criteria are 1526
met: 1527

division of which the offender previously has been convicted or 1537
to which the offender previously pleaded guilty, whether 1538
prosecuted together or separately. 1539

threat to cause serious physical harm to a person or resulted in 1550
serious physical harm to a person. 1551
(c) For purposes of division (B)(2)(b) of this section, 1552
two or more offenses committed at the same time or as part of 1553
the same act or event shall be considered one offense, and that 1554
one offense shall be the offense with the greatest penalty. 1555
(d) A sentence imposed under division (B)(2)(a) or (b) of 1556
this section shall not be reduced pursuant to section 2929.20, 1557
division (A)(2) or (3) of section 2967.193 or 2967.194, or any 1558
other provision of Chapter 2967. or Chapter 5120. of the Revised 1559

for the violation is life imprisonment or commits a violation of 1568
section 2903.02 of the Revised Code, if the offender commits a 1569
violation of section 2925.03 or 2925.11 of the Revised Code and 1570
that section classifies the offender as a major drug offender, 1571
if the offender commits a violation of section 2925.05 of the 1572
Revised Code and division (E)(1) of that section classifies the 1573

felony violation of section 2925.02, 2925.04, 2925.05, 2925.36, 1575
3719.07, 3719.08, 3719.16, 3719.161, 4729.37, or 4729.61, 1576

finds that the offender is guilty of a specification of the type 1582
described in division (A) of section 2941.1410 of the Revised 1583
Code charging that the offender is a major drug offender, if the 1584
court imposing sentence upon an offender for a felony finds that 1585
the offender is guilty of corrupt activity with the most serious 1586
offense in the pattern of corrupt activity being a felony of the 1587
first degree, or if the offender is guilty of an attempted 1588
violation of section 2907.02 of the Revised Code and, had the 1589
offender completed the violation of section 2907.02 of the 1590
Revised Code that was attempted, the offender would have been 1591

H. B. No. 338 Page 55

subject to a sentence of life imprisonment or life imprisonment 1592
without parole for the violation of section 2907.02 of the 1593
Revised Code, the court shall impose upon the offender for the 1594
felony violation a mandatory prison term determined as described 1595
in this division that cannot be reduced pursuant to section 1596
2929.20, division (A)(2) or (3) of section 2967.193 or 2967.194, 1597
or any other provision of Chapter 2967. or 5120. of the Revised 1598
Code. The mandatory prison term shall be the maximum definite 1599
prison term prescribed in division (A)(1)(b) of this section for 1600
a felony of the first degree, except that for offenses for which 1601
division (A)(1)(a) of this section applies, the mandatory prison 1602
term shall be the longest minimum prison term prescribed in that 1603
division for the offense. 1604
(4) If the offender is being sentenced for a third or 1605
fourth degree felony OVI offense under division (G)(2) of 1606

(3) of this section. In either case, the additional prison term 1617
imposed shall be reduced by the sixty or one hundred twenty days 1618
imposed upon the offender as the mandatory prison term. The 1619
total of the additional prison term imposed under division (B) 1620

felony OVI offense and shall equal one of the authorized prison 1624

degree felony OVI offense. If the court imposes an additional 1626
prison term under division (B)(4) of this section, the offender 1627
shall serve the additional prison term after the offender has 1628
served the mandatory prison term required for the offense. In 1629

additional prison term imposed as described in division (B)(4) 1631
of this section, the court also may sentence the offender to a 1632

felony OVI offense under division (G)(1) of section 2929.13 of 1638
the Revised Code and the court imposes a mandatory term of local 1639
incarceration, the court may impose a prison term as described 1640
in division (A)(1) of that section. 1641
(5) If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a 1642
violation of division (A)(1) or (2) of section 2903.06 of the 1643
Revised Code and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a 1644
