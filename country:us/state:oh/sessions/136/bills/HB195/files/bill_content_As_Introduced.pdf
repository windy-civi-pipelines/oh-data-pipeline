skill may be attributed by the person's employment of an agent 484

other intermediary's occupation holds the person out as having 486
such knowledge or skill. 487
(6) "Financing agency" means a bank, finance company, or 488
other person who in the ordinary course of business make 489
advances against goods or documents of title or who by 490
arrangement with either the seller or the buyer intervenes in 491
ordinary course to make or collect payment due or claimed under 492
the contract for sale, as by purchasing or paying the seller's 493
draft or making advances against it or by merely taking it for 494
collection whether or not documents of title accompany or are 495
associated with the draft. "Financing agency" includes also a 496

who are in the position of seller and buyer in respect to the 498
goods under section 1302.81 of the Revised Code. 499

to sell. 514
There may be a sale of a part interest in existing 515
identified goods. 516
An undivided share in an identified bulk of fungible goods 517
is sufficiently identified to be sold although the quantity of 518
the bulk is not determined. Any agreed proportion of such a bulk 519

relating to the present or future sale of goods. "Contract for 535

means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the 539
contract. 540

power created by agreement or law puts an end to the contract 545
otherwise than for its breach. On "termination" all obligations 546
which are still executory on both sides are discharged but any 547
right based on prior breach or performance survives. 548
(14) "Cancellation" occurs when either party puts an end 549
to the contract for breach by the other and its effect is the 550
same as that of "termination" except that the cancelling party 551
also retains any remedy for breach of the whole contract or any 552
unperformed balance. 553

1302.98, inclusive, of the Revised Code, apply to transactions 601
in goods; they do not apply to any transaction which although in 602
the form of an unconditional contract to sell or present sale is 603
intended to operate only as a security transaction nor do 604
sections 1302.01 to 1302.98, inclusive, of the Revised Code 605
impair or repeal any statute regulating sales to consumers, 606
farmers, or other specified classes of buyers and, in the case 607
of a hybrid transaction, it applies to the extent provided under 608
division (B) of this section. 609

the provisions of sections 1302.01 to 1302.98 of the Revised 612
Code which relate primarily to the sale-of-goods aspects of the 613
transactions apply, and the provisions that relate primarily to 614
the transaction as a whole do not apply. 615
(2) If the sale-of-goods aspects predominate, sections 616
1302.01 to 1302.98 of the Revised Code apply but do not preclude 617

that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and 634
signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by 635
histhe party's authorized agent or broker . A writing record is 636
not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term 637
agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under this 638
division beyond the quantity of goods shown in such writingthe 639
record. 640
(B) Between merchants if within a reasonable time a 641
writing record in confirmation of the contract and sufficient 642

respects is enforceable: 650

buyer and are not suitable for sale to others in the ordinary 652
course of the seller's business and the seller, before notice of 653
repudiation is received and under circumstances which reasonably 654
indicate that the goods are for the buyer, has made either a 655
substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for 656
their procurement; or 657
(2) if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits 658
in histhe party's pleading, testimony, or otherwise in court 659

its provisions. 707
(D) Although an attempt at modification or rescission does 708
not satisfy the requirements of division (B) or (C) of this 709
section, it can operate as a waiver. 710
(E) A party who has made a waiver affecting an executory 711
portion of the contract may retract the waiver by reasonable 712
notification received by the other party that strict performance 713
will be required of any term waived, unless the retraction would 714
be unjust in view of a material change of position in reliance 715
on the waiver. 716

(1) Except as otherwise provided in division (C) of this 1153
section, if the beneficiary's bank does not know that the name 1154
and number refer to different persons, it may rely on the number 1155
as the proper identification of the beneficiary of the order. 1156
The beneficiary's bank need not determine whether the name and 1157
number refer to the same person. 1158
(2) If the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified 1159
by name or knows that the name and number identify different 1160
persons, no person has rights as beneficiary except the person 1161
paid by the beneficiary's bank if that person was entitled to 1162
receive payment from the originator of the funds transfer. If no 1163
person has rights as beneficiary, acceptance of the order cannot 1164
occur. 1165
(C) If a payment order described in division (B) of this 1166
section is accepted, the originator's payment order described 1167
the beneficiary inconsistently by name and number, and the 1168
beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by number as 1169
permitted by division (B)(1) of this section, both of the 1170
following apply: 1171
(1) If the originator is a bank, the originator shall pay 1172
its order. 1173
(2) If the originator is not a bank and proves that the 1174
person identified by number was not entitled to receive payment 1175
from the originator, the originator is not obliged to pay its 1176

As Introduced
order unless the originator's bank proves that the originator, 1177
before acceptance of the originator's order, had notice that 1178
payment of a payment order issued by the originator might be 1179
made by the beneficiary's bank on the basis of an identifying or 1180
bank account number even if it identifies a person different 1181
from the named beneficiary. Proof of notice may be made by any 1182
admissible evidence. The originator's bank satisfies the burden 1183
of proof if it proves that the originator, before the payment 1184
order was accepted, signed a writing record stating the 1185
information to which the notice relates. 1186
(D) In a case governed by division (B)(1) of this section, 1187
if the beneficiary's bank rightfully pays the person identified 1188
by number and that person was not entitled to receive payment 1189
from the originator, the amount paid may be recovered from that 1190
person to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and 1191
restitution as follows: 1192
(1) If the originator is obliged to pay its payment order 1193
as stated in division (C) of this section, the originator may 1194
recover. 1195
(2) If the originator is not a bank and is not obliged to 1196
pay its payment order, the originator's bank may recover. 1197
Sec. 1304.63. Misdescription of intermediary bank or 1198
beneficiary's bank [UCC 4A-208] 1199
(A)(1) Divisions (A)(2) and (3) of this section apply to a 1200
payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the 1201
beneficiary's bank only by an identifying number. 1202
(2) The receiving bank may rely on the number as the 1203
proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank 1204
and need not determine whether the number identifies a bank. 1205

H. B. No. 195 Page 44
As Introduced
(3) The sender shall compensate the receiving bank for any 1206
loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of 1207
its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute 1208
the order. 1209
(B)(1) Divisions (B)(2) to (5) of this section apply to a 1210
payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the 1211
beneficiary's bank both by name and an identifying number if the 1212
name and number identify different persons. 1213
(2) If the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely 1214
on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary 1215
or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, when it executes 1216
the sender's order, does not know that the name and number 1217
identify different persons. The receiving bank need not 1218
determine whether the name and number refer to the same person 1219
or whether the number refers to a bank. The sender shall 1220
compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred 1221
by the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number 1222
in executing or attempting to execute the order. 1223
(3) If the sender is not a bank, and the receiving bank 1224
proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, 1225
had notice that the receiving bank might rely on the number as 1226
the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's 1227
bank even if it identifies a person different from the bank 1228
identified by name, the rights and obligations of the sender and 1229
the receiving bank are governed by division (B)(2) of this 1230
section, as though the sender were a bank. Proof of notice may 1231
be made by any admissible evidence. The receiving bank satisfies 1232
the burden of proof itif it proves that the sender, before the 1233
payment order was accepted, signed a writing record stating the 1234
information to which the notice relates. 1235

H. B. No. 195 Page 45
As Introduced
(4) Regardless of whether the sender is a bank, the 1236
receiving bank may rely on the name as the proper identification 1237
of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, 1238
at the time it executes the sender's order, does not know that 1239
the name and number identify different persons. The receiving 1240
bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the 1241
same person. 1242
(5) If the receiving bank knows that the name and number 1243
identify different persons, reliance on either the name or the 1244
number in executing the sender's payment order is a breach of 1245
the obligation as provided in division (A)(1) of section 1304.69 1246
of the Revised Code. 1247
Sec. 1304.65. Rejection of payment order [UCC 4A-210] 1248
(A) A payment order is rejected by the receiving bank by a 1249
notice of rejection transmitted to the sender orally, 1250
electronically, or in writinga record. A notice of rejection 1251
need not use any particular words and is sufficient if it 1252
indicates that the receiving bank is rejecting the order or will 1253
not execute or pay the order. Rejection is effective when the 1254
notice is given if transmission is by a means that is reasonable 1255
in the circumstances. If notice of rejection is given by a means 1256
that is not reasonable, rejection is effective when the notice 1257
is received. If an agreement of the sender and receiving bank 1258
establishes the means to be used to reject a payment order, any 1259
means complying with the agreement is reasonable, and any means 1260
not complying is not reasonable unless no significant delay in 1261
receipt of the notice resulted from the use of the noncomplying 1262
means. 1263
(B) This division applies if a receiving bank other than 1264
the beneficiary's bank fails to execute a payment order despite 1265

H. B. No. 195 Page 46
As Introduced
the existence on the execution date of a withdrawable credit 1266
balance in an authorized account of the sender sufficient to 1267
cover the order. If the sender does not receive notice of 1268
rejection of the order on the execution date and the authorized 1269
account of the sender does not bear interest, the bank shall pay 1270
interest to the sender on the amount of the order for the number 1271
of days elapsing after the execution date to the earlier of the 1272
day the order is canceled pursuant to division (D) of section 1273
1304.66 of the Revised Code or the day the sender receives 1274
notice or learns that the order was not executed, counting the 1275
final day of the period as an elapsed day. If the withdrawable 1276
credit balance during that period falls below the amount of the 1277
order, the amount of interest is reduced accordingly. 1278
(C) If a receiving bank suspends payments, all unaccepted 1279
payment orders issued to it are deemed rejected at the time the 1280
bank suspends payments. 1281
(D) Acceptance of a payment order precludes a later 1282
rejection of the order. Rejection of a payment order precludes a 1283
later acceptance of the order. 1284
Sec. 1304.66. Cancellation and amendment of payment order 1285
[UCC 4A-211] 1286
(A) A communication of the sender of a payment order 1287
canceling or amending the order may be transmitted to the 1288
receiving bank orally, electronically, or in writinga record. If 1289
a security procedure is in effect between the sender and the 1290
receiving bank, the communication is not effective to cancel or 1291
amend the order unless the communication is verified pursuant to 1292
the security procedure or the bank agrees to the cancellation or 1293
amendment. 1294

H. B. No. 195 Page 47
As Introduced
(B) Subject to division (A) of this section, a 1295
communication by the sender canceling or amending a payment 1296
order is effective to cancel or amend the order if notice of the 1297
communication is received at a time and in a manner affording 1298
the receiving bank a reasonable opportunity to act on the 1299
communication before the bank accepts the payment order. 1300
(C)(1) After a payment order has been accepted, 1301
cancellation or amendment of the order is not effective unless 1302
the receiving bank agrees or a funds-transfer system rule allows 1303
cancellation or amendment without agreement of the bank. 1304
(2) With respect to a payment order accepted by a 1305
receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank, cancellation 1306
or amendment is not effective unless a conforming cancellation 1307
or amendment of the payment order issued by the receiving bank 1308
is also made. 1309
(3) With respect to a payment order accepted by the 1310
beneficiary's bank, cancellation or amendment is not effective 1311
unless the order was issued in execution of an unauthorized 1312
payment order, or because of a mistake by a sender in the funds 1313
transfer that resulted in the issuance of a payment order that 1314
is a duplicate of a payment order previously issued by the 1315
sender, that orders payment to a beneficiary not entitled to 1316
receive payment from the originator, or that orders payment in 1317
an amount greater than the amount the beneficiary was entitled 1318
to receive from the originator. If the payment order is canceled 1319
or amended, the beneficiary's bank may recover from the 1320
beneficiary any amount paid to the beneficiary to the extent 1321
allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution. 1322
(D) An unaccepted payment order is canceled by operation 1323
of law at the close of the fifth funds-transfer business day of 1324

H. B. No. 195 Page 48
As Introduced
the receiving bank after the execution date or payment date of 1325
the order. 1326
(E) A canceled payment order cannot be accepted. If an 1327
accepted payment order is canceled, the acceptance is nullified, 1328
and no person has any right or obligation based on the 1329
acceptance. Amendment of a payment order is deemed to be 1330
cancellation of the original order at the time of amendment and 1331
issue of a new payment order in the amended form at the same 1332
time. 1333
(F) Unless otherwise provided in an agreement of the 1334
parties or in a funds-transfer system rule, if the receiving 1335
bank, after accepting a payment order, agrees to cancellation or 1336
amendment of the order by the sender or is bound by a funds- 1337
transfer system rule allowing cancellation or amendment without 1338
the bank's agreement, the sender, whether or not cancellation or 1339
amendment is effective, is liable to the bank for any loss and 1340
expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by the 1341
bank as a result of the cancellation, amendment, or attempted 1342
cancellation or amendment. 1343
(G) A payment order is not revoked by the death or legal 1344
incapacity of the sender unless the receiving bank knows of the 1345
death or of an adjudication of incapacity by a court of 1346
competent jurisdiction and has reasonable opportunity to act 1347
before acceptance of the order. 1348
(H) A funds-transfer system rule is not effective to the 1349
extent it conflicts with division (C)(3) of this section. 1350

payment order by the receiving bank without compliance with 1354
section 1304.69 of the Revised Code results in delay in payment 1355
to the beneficiary, the bank shall pay interest to either the 1356
originator or the beneficiary of the funds transfer for the 1357
period of delay caused by the improper execution. Except as 1358
provided in division (C) of this section, additional damages are 1359
not recoverable. 1360
(B) If execution of a payment order by a receiving bank 1361
without compliance with section 1304.69 of the Revised Code 1362
results in noncompletion of the funds transfer, failure to use 1363
an intermediary bank designated by the originator, or issuance 1364
of a payment order that does not comply with the terms of the 1365
payment order of the originator, the bank is liable to the 1366
originator for its expenses in the funds transfer and for 1367
incidental expenses and interest losses, to the extent not 1368
covered by division (A) of this section, resulting from the 1369
improper execution. Except as provided in division (C) of this 1370
section, additional damages are not recoverable. 1371
(C) In addition to the amounts payable under divisions (A) 1372
and (B) of this section, damages, including consequential 1373
damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in an express 1374
written agreement of the receiving bank, evidenced by a record. 1375
(D) If a receiving bank fails to execute a payment order 1376
it was obliged by express agreement to execute, the receiving 1377
bank is liable to the sender for its expenses in the transaction 1378
and for incidental expenses and interest losses resulting from 1379
the failure to execute. Additional damages, including 1380
consequential damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in 1381
an express written agreement of the receiving bank, evidenced by 1382
a record, but are not otherwise recoverable. 1383

(E) Reasonable attorney's fees are recoverable if demand 1384
for compensation under division (A) or (B) of this section is 1385
made and refused before an action is brought on the claim. If a 1386
claim is made for breach of an agreement under division (D) of 1387
this section and the agreement does not provide for damages, 1388
reasonable attorney's fees are recoverable if demand for 1389
compensation under division (D) of this section is made and 1390
refused before an action is brought on the claim. 1391
(F) Except as stated in this section, the liability of a 1392

Sec. 1305.15. Choice of law and forum [UCC 5-116] 1402
(A) The liability of an issuer, nominated person, or 1403
adviser for action or omission is governed by the law of the 1404
jurisdiction chosen by an agreement in the form of a record 1405
signed or otherwise authenticated by the affected parties in the 1406
manner provided in section 1305.03 of the Revised Code or by a 1407
provision in the person's letter of credit, confirmation, or 1408
other undertaking. The jurisdiction whose law is chosen need not 1409
bear any relation to the transaction. 1410
(B) Unless division (A) of this section applies, the 1411
liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser for action 1412

the person is located. The person is considered to be located at 1414
the address indicated in the person's undertaking. If more than 1415

at the address from which the person's undertaking was issued. 1417
For 1418
(C) For the purpose of jurisdiction, choice of law, and 1419
recognition of interbranch letters of credit, but not 1420
enforcement of a judgment, all branches of a bank are considered 1421

(E) Except as otherwise provided in this division, the 1429
liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser is governed 1430
by any rules of custom or practice, such as the uniform customs 1431
and practice for documentary credits, to which the letter of 1432
credit, confirmation, or other undertaking is expressly made 1433
subject. If (1) this chapter would govern the liability of an 1434
issuer, nominated person, or adviser under division (A) or (B) 1435
of this section, (2) the relevant undertaking incorporates rules 1436
of custom or practice, and (3) there is conflict between this 1437

(1) The authoritative electronic copy, a record attached 1557
to or logically associated with the authoritative electronic 1558
copy, or a system in which the authoritative electronic copy is 1559
recorded limits the use of the document of title or has a 1560
protocol that is programmed to cause a change, including a 1561
transfer or loss of control; 1562
