often showcasing diverse ecosystems, picturesque vistas, and 8
cultural heritage along their paths; and 9
WHEREAS, National Scenic Trails, like the Appalachian Trail 10
and the Pacific Crest Trail, are managed by various federal and 11
state agencies and offer well-maintained paths that attract 12
outdoor enthusiasts from across the country. They often 13
intersect with local communities and provide significant 14
economic benefits through tourism; and 15

miles from Lake Erie to the Ohio River, through the farmland of 18
northwest Ohio, the hills of Appalachia, the Black Hand 19
sandstone cliffs of the Hocking Hills region, and the Bluegrass 20
region of southwest Ohio; and 21
WHEREAS, The Buckeye Trail was established in 1959 by the 22
Buckeye Trail Association, a nonprofit organization that 23
currently administers the trail; and 24
WHEREAS, The National Park Service is conducting a study to 25
provide information to Congress on the feasibility and 26
desirability of designating the Buckeye Trail as a National 27
Scenic Trail. By objectively examining established criteria, the 28
National Park Service's study will assess how well the trail 29
aligns with the federal designation requirements, which 30
emphasize public access to and the preservation and conservation 31
of the trail's unique characteristics; and 32
WHEREAS, At the conclusion of the study, the National Park 33
Service will submit its findings to the Secretary of the 34
Interior, who then makes a recommendation to Congress for 35
consideration; now therefore be it 36
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the 136th General 37
Assembly of the State of Ohio, upon completion of the 38
feasibility study, urge Congress to designate the Buckeye Trail 39
as a National Scenic Trail; and be it further 40
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives 41
transmit duly authenticated copies of this resolution to the 42
President Pro Tempore and Secretary of the United States Senate, 43
Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, 44
members of Ohio's Congressional delegation, and the news media 45
of Ohio. 46
