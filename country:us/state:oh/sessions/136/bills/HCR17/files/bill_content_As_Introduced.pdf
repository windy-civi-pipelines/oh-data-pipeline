provide lifeguards for municipal beaches, leaving swimmers and 26

WHEREAS, Cities in Ohio have been increasing the wages paid 29

hour, which is projected to increase 12% over the next five 32
years; and 33
WHEREAS, Numerous other benefits are available to 34
individuals who choose to seek a career as a lifeguard, 35
including paid training, retention bonuses, and flexible 36
