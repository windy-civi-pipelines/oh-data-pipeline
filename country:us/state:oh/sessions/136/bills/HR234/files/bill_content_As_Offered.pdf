In memory of Jack Cera.
WHEREAS, The members of the House of Representatives of the 136th 1
General Assembly of Ohio were deeply saddened to learn of the death of 2
Jack Cera and pay tribute to his memory; and 3
WHEREAS, Jack Cera will be remembered fondly by all those who knew 4
him, and his absence will leave an irreparable void in our society. 5
Widely respected for his tenure with the Ohio General Assembly, he was 6
an advocate for the growth and progress of the State of Ohio and its 7
people, and over the course of his twenty-four years as a legislator 8
with the Ohio House of Representatives, he served as the minority whip 9
and on such important committees as Finance, Ways and Means, 10
Agriculture, Public Utilities, and Natural Resources. Clearly, his 11

tremendous concern and devotion to duty gained him the appreciation of 12
his colleagues and constituents alike; and 13
WHEREAS, Jack Cera’s passion for community service was always 14
evident in his own approach to public life, and he dedicated his time 15
to numerous organizations, including the Belmont County Port Authority 16
Board and Planning Commission, the Bellaire Public Library and Park 17
District boards, and the Bellaire and East Ohio girls softball 18
associations. The recipient of numerous awards, he was admired by his 19
fellow citizens, friends, and family alike for his positive philosophy 20
of life, and he has left a stalwart legacy to our state that will 21
surely live on; and 22
WHEREAS, Without question, Jack Cera made the world much fuller, 23
and he was especially devoted to the individuals who had a treasured 24
relationship with him, including his wife, Becky, his children, Jaclyn 25
and Bethany, and his grandchildren, Scarlett, Lena, and Finley. All 26
those who cherished him can find strength and solace in the happy 27
moments shared with this great man. Most assuredly, the State of Ohio 28
has benefited exponentially from his life’s work, and he will be 29
remembered for his visionary example of citizenship; therefore be it 30
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the House of Representatives of 31
the 136th General Assembly of Ohio, in adopting this Resolution, offer 32
our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Jack Cera and 33
express a profound sense of loss and sincere regret on the sorrowful 34
occasion of his death; and be it further 35
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives transmit 36
a duly authenticated copy of this Resolution to the family of Jack 37
Cera. 38
