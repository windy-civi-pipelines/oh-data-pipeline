WHEREAS, Charlie Kirk left an indelible impression on the people 5
whose lives he touched, and he will be remembered as a spirited 6
individual who contributed immeasurably to the world around him. He 7
was the founder and president of Turning Point USA, where he became 8
known for his ability to connect with students on college campuses 9
around the nation, and his dedication to advancing the company’s 10
mission of identifying, organizing, and empowering young people to 11
promote the principles of free markets and limited government was 12
truly impactful. Charlie Kirk’s movement was built on peaceful civil 13
discourse, as evidenced by his tireless efforts to foster respectful 14
exchanges of differing ideas; and 15
WHEREAS, Charlie Kirk was a devoted follower of Jesus Christ who 16
viewed the conservative movement as a spiritual battle worth fighting 17
and promoted a vision of American renewal rooted in Christian values; 18
and 19
WHEREAS, In his most important roles as a loving husband to his 20

wife, Erika, and a devoted father to his two children, Charlie Kirk 21
always used his talents to the benefit of those around him, and the 22
warmth and understanding which he readily extended to others will 23
stand as a testament to his personal character. Although the void 24
which his death has created can never be filled, the legacy of care 25
and commitment which he established will surely live on. The world is 26
a richer place for his having been in it, and he will be truly missed; 27
therefore be it 28
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the Ohio House of 29
Representatives of the 136th General Assembly, in adopting this 30
Resolution, condemn the political assassination of Charlie Kirk as a 31
horrific and unforgivable act of violence; and be it further 32
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives transmit 33
a duly authenticated copy of this Resolution to the family of Charles 34
James Kirk. 35
