holiday for four months each year for the sale 3

BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF OHIO:

Section 2:
Section 1. That sections 5739.02, 5739.03, and 5739.05 of 5
the Revised Code be amended to read as follows: 6
Sec. 5739.02. For the purpose of providing revenue with 7
which to meet the needs of the state, for the use of the general 8
revenue fund of the state, for the purpose of securing a 9
thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the 10
state, for the purpose of affording revenues, in addition to 11
those from general property taxes, permitted under 12
constitutional limitations, and from other sources, for the 13
support of local governmental functions, and for the purpose of 14
reimbursing the state for the expense of administering this 15
chapter, an excise tax is hereby levied on each retail sale made 16
in this state. 17
(A)(1) The tax shall be collected as provided in section 18

Section 3:
5739.025 of the Revised Code. The rate of the tax shall be five 19

and three-fourths per cent. The tax applies and is collectible 20
when the sale is made, regardless of the time when the price is 21
paid or delivered. 22
(2) In the case of the lease or rental, with a fixed term 23
of more than thirty days or an indefinite term with a minimum 24
period of more than thirty days, of any motor vehicles designed 25
by the manufacturer to carry a load of not more than one ton, 26
watercraft, outboard motor, or aircraft, or of any tangible 27
personal property, other than motor vehicles designed by the 28
manufacturer to carry a load of more than one ton, to be used by 29
the lessee or renter primarily for business purposes, the tax 30
shall be collected by the vendor at the time the lease or rental 31
is consummated and shall be calculated by the vendor on the 32
basis of the total amount to be paid by the lessee or renter 33
under the lease agreement. If the total amount of the 34
consideration for the lease or rental includes amounts that are 35
not calculated at the time the lease or rental is executed, the 36
tax shall be calculated and collected by the vendor at the time 37
such amounts are billed to the lessee or renter. In the case of 38
an open-end lease or rental, the tax shall be calculated by the 39
vendor on the basis of the total amount to be paid during the 40
initial fixed term of the lease or rental, and for each 41
subsequent renewal period as it comes due. As used in this 42
division, "motor vehicle" has the same meaning as in section 43

Section 4:

outdrive unit attached to the watercraft. 45
A lease with a renewal clause and a termination penalty or 46
similar provision that applies if the renewal clause is not 47
exercised is presumed to be a sham transaction. In such a case, 48
the tax shall be calculated and paid on the basis of the entire 49
length of the lease period, including any renewal periods, until 50
H. B. No. 330 Page 3

the termination penalty or similar provision no longer applies. 51
The taxpayer shall bear the burden, by a preponderance of the 52
evidence, that the transaction or series of transactions is not 53
a sham transaction. 54
(3) Except as provided in division (A)(2) of this section, 55
in the case of a sale, the price of which consists in whole or 56
in part of the lease or rental of tangible personal property, 57
the tax shall be measured by the installments of that lease or 58
rental. 59
(4) In the case of a sale of a physical fitness facility 60
service or recreation and sports club service, the price of 61
which consists in whole or in part of a membership for the 62

on a firearm, which shall be treated as the sale of a firearm 896
and not the firearm safety device. 897
(b) As used in division (B)(67) of this section: 898
(i) "Firearm safety device" means a device to be equipped 899
H. B. No. 330 Page 32
As Introduced
or installed on a firearm designed to prevent unauthorized 900
access to the firearm or to prevent it from being operated 901
without first deactivating the device. 902
(ii) "Firearm storage device" means a container or 903
enclosure designed for the principal purpose of safely storing a 904
firearm and secured by a combination lock, key lock, or lock 905
based on biometric information which, once locked is incapable 906
of being opened without the combination, key, or biometric 907
information, respectively. 908
(C) For the purpose of the proper administration of this 909
chapter, and to prevent the evasion of the tax, it is presumed 910
that all sales made in this state are subject to the tax until 911
the contrary is established. 912
(D) The tax collected by the vendor from the consumer 913
under this chapter is not part of the price, but is a tax 914
collection for the benefit of the state, and of counties levying 915
an additional sales tax pursuant to section 5739.021 or 5739.026 916
of the Revised Code and of transit authorities levying an 917
additional sales tax pursuant to section 5739.023 of the Revised 918
Code. Except for the discount authorized under section 5739.12 919
of the Revised Code and the effects of any rounding pursuant to 920

Section 24:
section 5703.055 of the Revised Code, no person other than the 921
state or such a county or transit authority shall derive any 922
benefit from the collection or payment of the tax levied by this 923

Section 25:
section or section 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 of the 924
Revised Code. 925
Sec. 5739.03. (A) Except as provided in section 5739.05 or 926

Section 26:
section 5739.051 of the Revised Code, the tax imposed by or 927
pursuant to section 5739.02, 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 of 928
the Revised Code shall be paid by the consumer to the vendor, 929
H. B. No. 330 Page 33
As Introduced
and each vendor shall collect from the consumer, as a trustee 930
for the state of Ohio, the full and exact amount of the tax 931
payable on each taxable sale, in the manner and at the times 932
provided as follows: 933
(1) If the price is, at or prior to the provision of the 934
service or the delivery of possession of the thing sold to the 935
consumer, paid in currency passed from hand to hand by the 936
consumer or the consumer's agent to the vendor or the vendor's 937
agent, the vendor or the vendor's agent shall collect the tax 938
with and at the same time as the price; 939
(2) If the price is otherwise paid or to be paid, the 940
vendor or the vendor's agent shall, at or prior to the provision 941
of the service or the delivery of possession of the thing sold 942
to the consumer, charge the tax imposed by or pursuant to 943

Section 27:
section 5739.02, 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 of the Revised 944
Code to the account of the consumer, which amount shall be 945
collected by the vendor from the consumer in addition to the 946
price. Such sale shall be reported on and the amount of the tax 947
applicable thereto shall be remitted with the return for the 948
period in which the sale is made, and the amount of the tax 949
shall become a legal charge in favor of the vendor and against 950
the consumer. 951
(B)(1)(a) If any sale is claimed to be exempt under 952
division (E) of section 5739.01 of the Revised Code or under 953

Section 28:
section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, with the exception of 954
divisions (B)(1) to (11), (28), (48), (55), (59), or (66), or 955
(67) of section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, the consumer must 956
provide to the vendor, and the vendor must obtain from the 957
consumer, a certificate specifying the reason that the sale is 958
not legally subject to the tax. The certificate shall be in such 959
H. B. No. 330 Page 34
As Introduced
form, and shall be provided either in a hard copy form or 960
electronic form, as the tax commissioner prescribes. 961
(b) A vendor that obtains a fully completed exemption 962
certificate from a consumer is relieved of liability for 963
collecting and remitting tax on any sale covered by that 964
certificate. If it is determined the exemption was improperly 965
claimed, the consumer shall be liable for any tax due on that 966
sale under section 5739.02, 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 or 967
Chapter 5741. of the Revised Code. Relief under this division 968
from liability does not apply to any of the following: 969
(i) A vendor that fraudulently fails to collect tax; 970
(ii) A vendor that solicits consumers to participate in 971
the unlawful claim of an exemption; 972
(iii) A vendor that accepts an exemption certificate from 973
a consumer that claims an exemption based on who purchases or 974
who sells property or a service, when the subject of the 975
transaction sought to be covered by the exemption certificate is 976
actually received by the consumer at a location operated by the 977
vendor in this state, and this state has posted to its web site 978
an exemption certificate form that clearly and affirmatively 979
indicates that the claimed exemption is not available in this 980
state; 981
(iv) A vendor that accepts an exemption certificate from a 982
consumer who claims a multiple points of use exemption under 983
division (D) of section 5739.033 of the Revised Code, if the 984
item purchased is tangible personal property, other than 985
prewritten computer software. 986
(2) The vendor shall maintain records, including exemption 987
certificates, of all sales on which a consumer has claimed an 988
H. B. No. 330 Page 35
As Introduced
exemption, and provide them to the tax commissioner on request. 989
(3) The tax commissioner may establish an identification 990
system whereby the commissioner issues an identification number 991
to a consumer that is exempt from payment of the tax. The 992
consumer must present the number to the vendor, if any sale is 993
claimed to be exempt as provided in this section. 994
(4) If no certificate is provided or obtained within 995
ninety days after the date on which such sale is consummated, it 996
shall be presumed that the tax applies. Failure to have so 997
provided or obtained a certificate shall not preclude a vendor, 998
within one hundred twenty days after the tax commissioner gives 999
written notice of intent to levy an assessment, from either 1000
establishing that the sale is not subject to the tax, or 1001
obtaining, in good faith, a fully completed exemption 1002
certificate. 1003
(5) Certificates need not be obtained nor provided where 1004
the identity of the consumer is such that the transaction is 1005
never subject to the tax imposed or where the item of tangible 1006
personal property sold or the service provided is never subject 1007
to the tax imposed, regardless of use, or when the sale is in 1008
interstate commerce. 1009
(6) If a transaction is claimed to be exempt under 1010
division (B)(13) of section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, the 1011
contractor shall obtain certification of the claimed exemption 1012
from the contractee. This certification shall be in addition to 1013
an exemption certificate provided by the contractor to the 1014
vendor. A contractee that provides a certification under this 1015
division shall be deemed to be the consumer of all items 1016
purchased by the contractor under the claim of exemption, if it 1017
is subsequently determined that the exemption is not properly 1018
H. B. No. 330 Page 36
As Introduced
claimed. The certification shall be in such form as the tax 1019
commissioner prescribes. 1020
(7) If a transaction is claimed to be exempt under 1021
division (B)(13) of section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, the 1022
person that leases a sports facility, as defined in section 1023

Section 29:
307.696 of the Revised Code, wholly owned by a county may 1024
provide and sign, on behalf of the county, an exemption 1025
certificate required under this section for that exemption. 1026
(C) As used in this division, "contractee" means a person 1027
who seeks to enter or enters into a contract or agreement with a 1028
contractor or vendor for the construction of real property or 1029
for the sale and installation onto real property of tangible 1030
personal property. 1031
Any contractor or vendor may request from any contractee a 1032
certification of what portion of the property to be transferred 1033
under such contract or agreement is to be incorporated into the 1034
realty and what portion will retain its status as tangible 1035
personal property after installation is completed. The 1036
contractor or vendor shall request the certification by 1037
certified mail delivered to the contractee, return receipt 1038
requested. Upon receipt of such request and prior to entering 1039
into the contract or agreement, the contractee shall provide to 1040
the contractor or vendor a certification sufficiently detailed 1041
to enable the contractor or vendor to ascertain the resulting 1042
classification of all materials purchased or fabricated by the 1043
contractor or vendor and transferred to the contractee. This 1044
requirement applies to a contractee regardless of whether the 1045
contractee holds a direct payment permit under section 5739.031 1046
of the Revised Code or provides to the contractor or vendor an 1047
exemption certificate as provided under this section. 1048
H. B. No. 330 Page 37
As Introduced
For the purposes of the taxes levied by this chapter and 1049
Chapter 5741. of the Revised Code, the contractor or vendor may 1050
in good faith rely on the contractee's certification. 1051
Notwithstanding division (B) of section 5739.01 of the Revised 1052
Code, if the tax commissioner determines that certain property 1053
certified by the contractee as tangible personal property 1054
pursuant to this division is, in fact, real property, the 1055
contractee shall be considered to be the consumer of all 1056
materials so incorporated into that real property and shall be 1057
liable for the applicable tax, and the contractor or vendor 1058
shall be excused from any liability on those materials. 1059
If a contractee fails to provide such certification upon 1060
the request of the contractor or vendor, the contractor or 1061
vendor shall comply with the provisions of this chapter and 1062
Chapter 5741. of the Revised Code without the certification. If 1063
the tax commissioner determines that such compliance has been 1064
performed in good faith and that certain property treated as 1065
tangible personal property by the contractor or vendor is, in 1066
fact, real property, the contractee shall be considered to be 1067
the consumer of all materials so incorporated into that real 1068
property and shall be liable for the applicable tax, and the 1069
construction contractor or vendor shall be excused from any 1070
liability on those materials. 1071
This division does not apply to any contract or agreement 1072
where the tax commissioner determines as a fact that a 1073
certification under this division was made solely on the 1074
decision or advice of the contractor or vendor. 1075
(D) Notwithstanding division (B) of section 5739.01 of the 1076
Revised Code, whenever the total rate of tax imposed under this 1077
chapter is increased after the date after a construction 1078
H. B. No. 330 Page 38
As Introduced
contract is entered into, the contractee shall reimburse the 1079
construction contractor for any additional tax paid on tangible 1080
property consumed or services received pursuant to the contract. 1081
(E) A vendor who files a petition for reassessment 1082
contesting the assessment of tax on sales for which the vendor 1083
obtained no valid exemption certificates and for which the 1084
vendor failed to establish that the sales were properly not 1085
subject to the tax during the one-hundred-twenty-day period 1086
allowed under division (B) of this section, may present to the 1087
tax commissioner additional evidence to prove that the sales 1088
were properly subject to a claim of exception or exemption. The 1089
vendor shall file such evidence within ninety days of the 1090
receipt by the vendor of the notice of assessment, except that, 1091
upon application and for reasonable cause, the period for 1092
submitting such evidence shall be extended thirty days. 1093
The commissioner shall consider such additional evidence 1094
in reaching the final determination on the assessment and 1095
petition for reassessment. 1096
(F) Whenever a vendor refunds the price, minus any 1097
separately stated delivery charge, of an item of tangible 1098
personal property on which the tax imposed under this chapter 1099
has been paid, the vendor shall also refund the amount of tax 1100
paid, minus the amount of tax attributable to the delivery 1101
charge. 1102
Sec. 5739.05. (A)(1) The tax commissioner shall enforce 1103
and administer sections 5739.01 to 5739.31 of the Revised Code, 1104
which are hereby declared to be sections which the commissioner 1105
is required to administer within the meaning of sections 5703.17 1106
to 5703.37, 5703.39, 5703.41, and 5703.45 of the Revised Code. 1107
The commissioner may adopt and promulgate, in accordance with 1108
H. B. No. 330 Page 39
As Introduced

Section 30:
sections 119.01 to 119.13 of the Revised Code, such rules as the 1109
commissioner deems necessary to administer sections 5739.01 to 1110

Section 31:
5739.31 of the Revised Code. 1111
(2) On or before the first day of May of each year, the 1112
commissioner shall make available to vendors a notice explaining 1113
the three-day exemption period required under division (B)(55) 1114
of section 5739.02 of the Revised Code. 1115
(3) On or before first day of December and August of each 1116
year, the commissioner shall make available to vendors a notice 1117
explaining the two-month exemption period required under 1118
division (B)(67) of section 5739.02 of the Revised Code 1119
commencing on the following first day of March or November, 1120
respectively. 1121
(B) Upon application, the commissioner may authorize a 1122
vendor to pay on a predetermined basis the tax levied by or 1123
pursuant to section 5739.02, 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 of 1124
the Revised Code upon sales of things produced or distributed or 1125
services provided by such vendor, and the commissioner may waive 1126
the collection of the tax from the consumer. The commissioner 1127
shall not grant such authority unless the commissioner finds 1128
that the granting of the authority would improve compliance and 1129
increase the efficiency of the administration of the tax. The 1130
person to whom such authority is granted shall post a notice, if 1131
required by the commissioner, at the location where the product 1132
is offered for sale that the tax is included in the selling 1133
price. The commissioner may adopt rules to administer this 1134
division. 1135
(C) Upon application, the commissioner may authorize a 1136
vendor to remit, on the basis of a prearranged agreement under 1137
this division, the tax levied by section 5739.02 or pursuant to 1138
H. B. No. 330 Page 40
As Introduced

Section 32:
section 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 of the Revised Code. The 1139
proportions and ratios in a prearranged agreement shall be 1140
determined either by a test check conducted by the commissioner 1141
under terms and conditions agreed to by the commissioner and the 1142
vendor or by any other method agreed upon by the vendor and the 1143
commissioner. If the parties are unable to agree to the terms 1144
and conditions of the test check or other method, the 1145
application shall be denied. 1146
If used, the test check shall determine the proportion 1147
that taxable retail sales bear to all of the vendor's retail 1148
sales and the ratio which the tax required to be collected under 1149

Section 33:
sections 5739.02, 5739.021, 5739.023, and 5739.026 of the 1150
Revised Code bears to the receipts from the vendor's taxable 1151
retail sales. 1152
The vendor's liability for remitting the tax shall be 1153
based solely upon the proportions and ratios established in the 1154
agreement until such time that the vendor or the commissioner 1155
believes that the nature of the vendor's business has so changed 1156
as to make the agreement no longer representative. The 1157
commissioner may give notice to the vendor at any time that the 1158
authorization is revoked or the vendor may notify the 1159
commissioner that the vendor no longer elects to report under 1160
the authorization. Such notice shall be delivered to the other 1161
party in the manner provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised 1162
Code. The revocation or cancellation is effective the last day 1163
of the month in which the vendor or the commissioner receives 1164
the notice. 1165

Section 34:
Section 2. That existing sections 5739.02, 5739.03, and 1166

Section 35:
5739.05 of the Revised Code are hereby repealed. 1167

As Introduced
136th General Assembly

2025-2026
Representatives Deeter, Fischer
Cosponsors: Representatives Johnson, Brennan, Williams, King, Newman
To amend sections 5739.02, 5739.03, and 5739.05 of 1
the Revised Code to authorize a sales tax 2
holiday for four months each year for the sale 3
of firearm safety and storage devices. 4
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF OHIO:
Section 1. That sections 5739.02, 5739.03, and 5739.05 of 5
the Revised Code be amended to read as follows: 6
Sec. 5739.02. For the purpose of providing revenue with 7
which to meet the needs of the state, for the use of the general 8
revenue fund of the state, for the purpose of securing a 9
thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the 10
state, for the purpose of affording revenues, in addition to 11
those from general property taxes, permitted under 12
constitutional limitations, and from other sources, for the 13
support of local governmental functions, and for the purpose of 14
reimbursing the state for the expense of administering this 15
chapter, an excise tax is hereby levied on each retail sale made 16
in this state. 17
(A)(1) The tax shall be collected as provided in section 18
5739.025 of the Revised Code. The rate of the tax shall be five 19

H. B. No. 330 Page 2
As Introduced
and three-fourths per cent. The tax applies and is collectible 20
when the sale is made, regardless of the time when the price is 21
paid or delivered. 22
(2) In the case of the lease or rental, with a fixed term 23
of more than thirty days or an indefinite term with a minimum 24
period of more than thirty days, of any motor vehicles designed 25
by the manufacturer to carry a load of not more than one ton, 26
watercraft, outboard motor, or aircraft, or of any tangible 27
personal property, other than motor vehicles designed by the 28
manufacturer to carry a load of more than one ton, to be used by 29
the lessee or renter primarily for business purposes, the tax 30
shall be collected by the vendor at the time the lease or rental 31
is consummated and shall be calculated by the vendor on the 32
basis of the total amount to be paid by the lessee or renter 33
under the lease agreement. If the total amount of the 34
consideration for the lease or rental includes amounts that are 35
not calculated at the time the lease or rental is executed, the 36
tax shall be calculated and collected by the vendor at the time 37
such amounts are billed to the lessee or renter. In the case of 38
an open-end lease or rental, the tax shall be calculated by the 39
vendor on the basis of the total amount to be paid during the 40
initial fixed term of the lease or rental, and for each 41
subsequent renewal period as it comes due. As used in this 42
division, "motor vehicle" has the same meaning as in section 43
4501.01 of the Revised Code, and "watercraft" includes an 44
outdrive unit attached to the watercraft. 45
A lease with a renewal clause and a termination penalty or 46
similar provision that applies if the renewal clause is not 47
exercised is presumed to be a sham transaction. In such a case, 48
the tax shall be calculated and paid on the basis of the entire 49
length of the lease period, including any renewal periods, until 50

H. B. No. 330 Page 3
As Introduced
the termination penalty or similar provision no longer applies. 51
The taxpayer shall bear the burden, by a preponderance of the 52
evidence, that the transaction or series of transactions is not 53
a sham transaction. 54
(3) Except as provided in division (A)(2) of this section, 55
in the case of a sale, the price of which consists in whole or 56
in part of the lease or rental of tangible personal property, 57
the tax shall be measured by the installments of that lease or 58
rental. 59
(4) In the case of a sale of a physical fitness facility 60
service or recreation and sports club service, the price of 61
which consists in whole or in part of a membership for the 62
receipt of the benefit of the service, the tax applicable to the 63
sale shall be measured by the installments thereof. 64
(B) The tax does not apply to the following: 65

subdivisions if the laws of that state exempt from taxation 68

Code, if it is separately stated on the invoice, bill of sale, 887
or similar document given by the vendor to the consumer for a 888
retail sale made in this state. 889
(66) Sales of eligible tangible personal property 890
occurring during the period of a sales tax holiday held pursuant 891

(67)(a) Sales of a firearm safety device or firearm 893
storage device occurring in March, April, November, or December 894
of any year, excluding a firearm safety device already installed 895
on a firearm, which shall be treated as the sale of a firearm 896
and not the firearm safety device. 897
(b) As used in division (B)(67) of this section: 898
(i) "Firearm safety device" means a device to be equipped 899

H. B. No. 330 Page 32

or installed on a firearm designed to prevent unauthorized 900
access to the firearm or to prevent it from being operated 901
without first deactivating the device. 902
(ii) "Firearm storage device" means a container or 903
enclosure designed for the principal purpose of safely storing a 904
firearm and secured by a combination lock, key lock, or lock 905
based on biometric information which, once locked is incapable 906
of being opened without the combination, key, or biometric 907
information, respectively. 908
(C) For the purpose of the proper administration of this 909
chapter, and to prevent the evasion of the tax, it is presumed 910
that all sales made in this state are subject to the tax until 911
the contrary is established. 912
(D) The tax collected by the vendor from the consumer 913
under this chapter is not part of the price, but is a tax 914
collection for the benefit of the state, and of counties levying 915
an additional sales tax pursuant to section 5739.021 or 5739.026 916
of the Revised Code and of transit authorities levying an 917
additional sales tax pursuant to section 5739.023 of the Revised 918
Code. Except for the discount authorized under section 5739.12 919
of the Revised Code and the effects of any rounding pursuant to 920
section 5703.055 of the Revised Code, no person other than the 921
state or such a county or transit authority shall derive any 922
benefit from the collection or payment of the tax levied by this 923
section or section 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 of the 924
Revised Code. 925
Sec. 5739.03. (A) Except as provided in section 5739.05 or 926
section 5739.051 of the Revised Code, the tax imposed by or 927
pursuant to section 5739.02, 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 of 928
the Revised Code shall be paid by the consumer to the vendor, 929

H. B. No. 330 Page 33
As Introduced
and each vendor shall collect from the consumer, as a trustee 930
for the state of Ohio, the full and exact amount of the tax 931
payable on each taxable sale, in the manner and at the times 932
provided as follows: 933
(1) If the price is, at or prior to the provision of the 934
service or the delivery of possession of the thing sold to the 935
consumer, paid in currency passed from hand to hand by the 936
consumer or the consumer's agent to the vendor or the vendor's 937
agent, the vendor or the vendor's agent shall collect the tax 938
with and at the same time as the price; 939
(2) If the price is otherwise paid or to be paid, the 940
vendor or the vendor's agent shall, at or prior to the provision 941
of the service or the delivery of possession of the thing sold 942
to the consumer, charge the tax imposed by or pursuant to 943
section 5739.02, 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 of the Revised 944
Code to the account of the consumer, which amount shall be 945
collected by the vendor from the consumer in addition to the 946
price. Such sale shall be reported on and the amount of the tax 947
applicable thereto shall be remitted with the return for the 948
period in which the sale is made, and the amount of the tax 949
shall become a legal charge in favor of the vendor and against 950
the consumer. 951
(B)(1)(a) If any sale is claimed to be exempt under 952
division (E) of section 5739.01 of the Revised Code or under 953
section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, with the exception of 954
divisions (B)(1) to (11), (28), (48), (55), (59), or (66), or 955
(67) of section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, the consumer must 956
provide to the vendor, and the vendor must obtain from the 957
consumer, a certificate specifying the reason that the sale is 958
not legally subject to the tax. The certificate shall be in such 959

H. B. No. 330 Page 34
As Introduced
form, and shall be provided either in a hard copy form or 960
electronic form, as the tax commissioner prescribes. 961
(b) A vendor that obtains a fully completed exemption 962
certificate from a consumer is relieved of liability for 963
collecting and remitting tax on any sale covered by that 964
certificate. If it is determined the exemption was improperly 965
claimed, the consumer shall be liable for any tax due on that 966
sale under section 5739.02, 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 or 967
Chapter 5741. of the Revised Code. Relief under this division 968
from liability does not apply to any of the following: 969
(i) A vendor that fraudulently fails to collect tax; 970
(ii) A vendor that solicits consumers to participate in 971
the unlawful claim of an exemption; 972
(iii) A vendor that accepts an exemption certificate from 973
a consumer that claims an exemption based on who purchases or 974
who sells property or a service, when the subject of the 975
transaction sought to be covered by the exemption certificate is 976
actually received by the consumer at a location operated by the 977
vendor in this state, and this state has posted to its web site 978
an exemption certificate form that clearly and affirmatively 979
indicates that the claimed exemption is not available in this 980
state; 981
(iv) A vendor that accepts an exemption certificate from a 982
consumer who claims a multiple points of use exemption under 983
division (D) of section 5739.033 of the Revised Code, if the 984
item purchased is tangible personal property, other than 985
prewritten computer software. 986
(2) The vendor shall maintain records, including exemption 987
certificates, of all sales on which a consumer has claimed an 988

H. B. No. 330 Page 35
As Introduced
exemption, and provide them to the tax commissioner on request. 989
(3) The tax commissioner may establish an identification 990
system whereby the commissioner issues an identification number 991
to a consumer that is exempt from payment of the tax. The 992
consumer must present the number to the vendor, if any sale is 993
claimed to be exempt as provided in this section. 994
(4) If no certificate is provided or obtained within 995
ninety days after the date on which such sale is consummated, it 996
shall be presumed that the tax applies. Failure to have so 997
provided or obtained a certificate shall not preclude a vendor, 998
within one hundred twenty days after the tax commissioner gives 999
written notice of intent to levy an assessment, from either 1000
establishing that the sale is not subject to the tax, or 1001
obtaining, in good faith, a fully completed exemption 1002
certificate. 1003
(5) Certificates need not be obtained nor provided where 1004
the identity of the consumer is such that the transaction is 1005
never subject to the tax imposed or where the item of tangible 1006
personal property sold or the service provided is never subject 1007
to the tax imposed, regardless of use, or when the sale is in 1008
interstate commerce. 1009
(6) If a transaction is claimed to be exempt under 1010
division (B)(13) of section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, the 1011
contractor shall obtain certification of the claimed exemption 1012
from the contractee. This certification shall be in addition to 1013
an exemption certificate provided by the contractor to the 1014
vendor. A contractee that provides a certification under this 1015
division shall be deemed to be the consumer of all items 1016
purchased by the contractor under the claim of exemption, if it 1017
is subsequently determined that the exemption is not properly 1018

H. B. No. 330 Page 36
As Introduced
claimed. The certification shall be in such form as the tax 1019
commissioner prescribes. 1020
(7) If a transaction is claimed to be exempt under 1021
division (B)(13) of section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, the 1022
person that leases a sports facility, as defined in section 1023
307.696 of the Revised Code, wholly owned by a county may 1024
provide and sign, on behalf of the county, an exemption 1025
certificate required under this section for that exemption. 1026
(C) As used in this division, "contractee" means a person 1027
who seeks to enter or enters into a contract or agreement with a 1028
contractor or vendor for the construction of real property or 1029
for the sale and installation onto real property of tangible 1030
personal property. 1031
Any contractor or vendor may request from any contractee a 1032
certification of what portion of the property to be transferred 1033
under such contract or agreement is to be incorporated into the 1034
realty and what portion will retain its status as tangible 1035
personal property after installation is completed. The 1036
contractor or vendor shall request the certification by 1037
certified mail delivered to the contractee, return receipt 1038
requested. Upon receipt of such request and prior to entering 1039
into the contract or agreement, the contractee shall provide to 1040
the contractor or vendor a certification sufficiently detailed 1041
to enable the contractor or vendor to ascertain the resulting 1042
classification of all materials purchased or fabricated by the 1043
contractor or vendor and transferred to the contractee. This 1044
requirement applies to a contractee regardless of whether the 1045
contractee holds a direct payment permit under section 5739.031 1046
of the Revised Code or provides to the contractor or vendor an 1047
exemption certificate as provided under this section. 1048

H. B. No. 330 Page 37
As Introduced
For the purposes of the taxes levied by this chapter and 1049
Chapter 5741. of the Revised Code, the contractor or vendor may 1050
in good faith rely on the contractee's certification. 1051
Notwithstanding division (B) of section 5739.01 of the Revised 1052
Code, if the tax commissioner determines that certain property 1053
certified by the contractee as tangible personal property 1054
pursuant to this division is, in fact, real property, the 1055
contractee shall be considered to be the consumer of all 1056
materials so incorporated into that real property and shall be 1057
liable for the applicable tax, and the contractor or vendor 1058
shall be excused from any liability on those materials. 1059
If a contractee fails to provide such certification upon 1060
the request of the contractor or vendor, the contractor or 1061
vendor shall comply with the provisions of this chapter and 1062
Chapter 5741. of the Revised Code without the certification. If 1063
the tax commissioner determines that such compliance has been 1064
performed in good faith and that certain property treated as 1065
tangible personal property by the contractor or vendor is, in 1066
fact, real property, the contractee shall be considered to be 1067
the consumer of all materials so incorporated into that real 1068
property and shall be liable for the applicable tax, and the 1069
construction contractor or vendor shall be excused from any 1070
liability on those materials. 1071
This division does not apply to any contract or agreement 1072
where the tax commissioner determines as a fact that a 1073
certification under this division was made solely on the 1074
decision or advice of the contractor or vendor. 1075
(D) Notwithstanding division (B) of section 5739.01 of the 1076
Revised Code, whenever the total rate of tax imposed under this 1077
chapter is increased after the date after a construction 1078

H. B. No. 330 Page 38
As Introduced
contract is entered into, the contractee shall reimburse the 1079
construction contractor for any additional tax paid on tangible 1080
property consumed or services received pursuant to the contract. 1081
(E) A vendor who files a petition for reassessment 1082
contesting the assessment of tax on sales for which the vendor 1083
obtained no valid exemption certificates and for which the 1084
vendor failed to establish that the sales were properly not 1085
subject to the tax during the one-hundred-twenty-day period 1086
allowed under division (B) of this section, may present to the 1087
tax commissioner additional evidence to prove that the sales 1088
were properly subject to a claim of exception or exemption. The 1089
vendor shall file such evidence within ninety days of the 1090
receipt by the vendor of the notice of assessment, except that, 1091
upon application and for reasonable cause, the period for 1092
submitting such evidence shall be extended thirty days. 1093
The commissioner shall consider such additional evidence 1094
in reaching the final determination on the assessment and 1095
petition for reassessment. 1096
(F) Whenever a vendor refunds the price, minus any 1097
separately stated delivery charge, of an item of tangible 1098
personal property on which the tax imposed under this chapter 1099
has been paid, the vendor shall also refund the amount of tax 1100
paid, minus the amount of tax attributable to the delivery 1101
charge. 1102
Sec. 5739.05. (A)(1) The tax commissioner shall enforce 1103
and administer sections 5739.01 to 5739.31 of the Revised Code, 1104
which are hereby declared to be sections which the commissioner 1105
is required to administer within the meaning of sections 5703.17 1106
to 5703.37, 5703.39, 5703.41, and 5703.45 of the Revised Code. 1107
The commissioner may adopt and promulgate, in accordance with 1108

H. B. No. 330 Page 39
As Introduced
sections 119.01 to 119.13 of the Revised Code, such rules as the 1109
commissioner deems necessary to administer sections 5739.01 to 1110
5739.31 of the Revised Code. 1111
(2) On or before the first day of May of each year, the 1112
commissioner shall make available to vendors a notice explaining 1113
the three-day exemption period required under division (B)(55) 1114
of section 5739.02 of the Revised Code. 1115
(3) On or before first day of December and August of each 1116
year, the commissioner shall make available to vendors a notice 1117
explaining the two-month exemption period required under 1118
division (B)(67) of section 5739.02 of the Revised Code 1119
commencing on the following first day of March or November, 1120
respectively. 1121
(B) Upon application, the commissioner may authorize a 1122
vendor to pay on a predetermined basis the tax levied by or 1123
pursuant to section 5739.02, 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 of 1124
the Revised Code upon sales of things produced or distributed or 1125
services provided by such vendor, and the commissioner may waive 1126
the collection of the tax from the consumer. The commissioner 1127
shall not grant such authority unless the commissioner finds 1128
that the granting of the authority would improve compliance and 1129
increase the efficiency of the administration of the tax. The 1130
person to whom such authority is granted shall post a notice, if 1131
required by the commissioner, at the location where the product 1132
is offered for sale that the tax is included in the selling 1133
price. The commissioner may adopt rules to administer this 1134
division. 1135
(C) Upon application, the commissioner may authorize a 1136
vendor to remit, on the basis of a prearranged agreement under 1137
this division, the tax levied by section 5739.02 or pursuant to 1138

H. B. No. 330 Page 40
As Introduced
section 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 of the Revised Code. The 1139
proportions and ratios in a prearranged agreement shall be 1140
determined either by a test check conducted by the commissioner 1141
under terms and conditions agreed to by the commissioner and the 1142
vendor or by any other method agreed upon by the vendor and the 1143
commissioner. If the parties are unable to agree to the terms 1144
and conditions of the test check or other method, the 1145
application shall be denied. 1146
If used, the test check shall determine the proportion 1147
that taxable retail sales bear to all of the vendor's retail 1148
sales and the ratio which the tax required to be collected under 1149
sections 5739.02, 5739.021, 5739.023, and 5739.026 of the 1150
Revised Code bears to the receipts from the vendor's taxable 1151
retail sales. 1152
The vendor's liability for remitting the tax shall be 1153
based solely upon the proportions and ratios established in the 1154
agreement until such time that the vendor or the commissioner 1155
believes that the nature of the vendor's business has so changed 1156
as to make the agreement no longer representative. The 1157
commissioner may give notice to the vendor at any time that the 1158
authorization is revoked or the vendor may notify the 1159
commissioner that the vendor no longer elects to report under 1160
the authorization. Such notice shall be delivered to the other 1161
party in the manner provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised 1162
Code. The revocation or cancellation is effective the last day 1163
of the month in which the vendor or the commissioner receives 1164
the notice. 1165
Section 2. That existing sections 5739.02, 5739.03, and 1166
5739.05 of the Revised Code are hereby repealed. 1167
Section 3. The amendment by this act of section 5739.02 of 1168

H. B. No. 330 Page 41

the Revised Code applies on and after the first day of March, 1169
April, November, or December occurring after the effective date 1170
of this section, whichever comes first. 1171
