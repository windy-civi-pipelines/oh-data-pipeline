Revised Code. Any objection shall be made no later than thirty 23
days prior to the expiration of the permit, and the division 24
shall accept the objection if it is postmarked no later than 25
thirty days prior to the expiration of the permit. The objection 26
shall be made by a resolution specifying the reasons for 27

premises with local zoning regulations that prohibit the sale of 30
beer or intoxicating liquor in an area zoned for commercial or 31

legal officer's opinion, the objection is based upon substantial 36
legal grounds within the meaning and intent of division (A) of 37

Upon receipt of a resolution of a legislative authority or 39

the chief legal officer, the division shall set a time for the 41
hearing and send by certified mail to the permit holder, at the 42

that, upon written request of the legislative authority or 46
board, the hearing shall be held in the county seat of the 47
county in which the permit premises is located, to determine 48
whether the renewal shall be denied for any of the reasons 49
contained in division (A) of section 4303.292 of the Revised 50

Revised Code for each holder of a permit issued under sections 81

permit holder is delinquent in filing any returns, submitting 83
any information required by the commissioner, or remitting any 84

manner provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. The 89
notice shall specify, in as much detail as is possible, the 90

amount of unpaid assessments and other liabilities and shall be 92
sent on or before the first day of the third month preceding the 93
month in which the permit expires. The commissioner also shall 94
notify the division of liquor control of the delinquency or 95
liability, identifying the permit holder by name and permit 96
number. 97
(2)(a) Except as provided in division (D)(4) of this 98
section, the division of liquor control shall not renew the 99
permit of any permit holder the tax commissioner has identified 100
as being delinquent in filing any returns, providing any 101
information, or remitting any payments with respect to the taxes 102
listed in division (D)(1) of this section as of the first day of 103
the sixth month preceding the month in which the permit expires, 104
or of any permit holder the commissioner has identified as 105
having been assessed by the department on or before the first 106

permit expires, any permit holder whose permit is not renewed 111
under this division may file an appeal with the liquor control 112
commission. The commission shall notify the tax commissioner 113
regarding the filing of any such appeal. During the period in 114
which the appeal is pending, the permit shall not be renewed by 115
the division. The permit shall be reinstated if the permit 116
holder and the commissioner or the attorney general demonstrate 117
to the liquor control commission that the commissioner's 118
notification of a delinquency or assessment was in error or that 119
the issue of the delinquency or assessment has been resolved. 120
(ii) A permit holder who has filed an appeal under 121
division (D)(2)(b)(i) of this section may file a motion to 122
withdraw the appeal. The division of liquor control may renew a 123
permit holder's permit if the permit holder has withdrawn such 124
an appeal and the division receives written certification from 125
the tax commissioner that the permit holder's delinquency or 126
assessment has been resolved. 127
(3) A permit holder notified of delinquency or liability 128
under this section may protest the notification to the tax 129
commissioner on the basis that no return or information is 130
delinquent and no tax, fee, charge, penalty, or interest is 131
outstanding. The commissioner shall expeditiously consider any 132
evidence submitted by the permit holder and, if it is determined 133
that the notification was in error, immediately shall inform the 134
division of liquor control that the renewal application may be 135
granted. The renewal shall not be denied if the delinquency or 136
unreported liability is the subject of a bona fide dispute as to 137
the validity of the delinquency or unreported liability and is 138
the subject of an assessment and of an appeal properly filed by 139
the permit holder. 140

(4) If the commissioner concludes that under the 141
circumstances the permit holder's delinquency or liability has 142
been conditionally resolved, the commissioner shall allow the 143
permit to be renewed, conditioned upon the permit holder's 144
continuing performance in satisfying the delinquency and 145
liability. The conditional nature of the renewal shall be 146
specified in the notification given to the division of liquor 147
control under division (D)(1) of this section. Upon receipt of 148
notice of the resolution, the division shall issue a conditional 149
renewal. If the taxpayer defaults on any agreement to pay the 150
delinquency or liability or fails to keep subsequent tax or fee 151
payments current, the liquor control commission, upon request 152
and proof of the default or failure to keep subsequent tax or 153
fee payments current, shall indefinitely suspend the permit 154
holder's permit until all taxes or fees and interest due are 155
paid. 156
