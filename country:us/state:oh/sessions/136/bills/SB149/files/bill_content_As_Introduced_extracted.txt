purposes of this provision, an emergency Rule is one that must 752
be adopted immediately in order to: 753
1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or 754
welfare; 755
2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Member State funds; 756
3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is 757
established by federal law or Rule; or 758
4. Protect public health and safety. 759
M. The Commission or an authorized committee of the 760
Commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted Rule for 761
purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, 762
errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of 763
any revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. 764
The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a 765
period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be 766
challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a 767
material change to a Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing 768
and delivered to the Commission prior to the end of the notice 769
period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect 770
without further action. If the revision is challenged, the 771
revision may not take effect without the approval of the 772
Commission. 773
N. No Member State's rulemaking process or procedural 774
requirements shall apply to the Commission. 775

S. B. No. 149 Page 29
As Introduced
1. The Commission shall have no authority over any Member 776
State's rulemaking process or procedural requirements that do 777
not pertain to the Compact. 778
O. Nothing in this Compact, nor any Rule or regulation of 779
the Commission, shall be construed to limit, restrict, or in any 780
way reduce the ability of a Member State to enact and enforce 781
laws, regulations, or other Rules related to the Practice of 782
Respiratory Therapy in that State, where those laws, 783
regulations, or other Rules are not inconsistent with the 784
provisions of this Compact. 785
SECTION 10. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT 786
A. Oversight 787
1. The executive and judicial branches of State government 788
in each Member State shall enforce this Compact and take all 789
actions necessary and appropriate to implement the Compact. 790
2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against 791
the Commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a 792
court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of 793
the Commission is located. The Commission may waive venue and 794
jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to 795
participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. 796
Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety 797
of venue in any action against a Licensee for professional 798
malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter. 799
3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of 800
process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or 801
interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to 802
intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to 803
provide the Commission service of process shall render a 804

S. B. No. 149 Page 30
As Introduced
judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or 805
promulgated Rules. 806
B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination 807
1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has 808
defaulted in the performance of its obligations or 809
responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated Rules, 810
the Commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting 811
State. The notice of default shall describe the default, the 812
proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that 813
the Commission may take, and shall offer training and specific 814
technical assistance regarding the default. 815
2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of 816
default to the other Member States. 817
C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the 818
defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an 819
affirmative vote of a majority of the Commissioners of the 820
Member States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred 821
on that State by this Compact may be terminated on the effective 822
date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the 823
offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during 824
the period of default. 825
D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be 826
imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have 827
been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall 828
be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and 829
minority leaders of the defaulting State's legislature, the 830
defaulting State's Respiratory Therapy Licensing Authority and 831
each of the Member States' Respiratory Therapy Licensing 832
Authorities. 833

S. B. No. 149 Page 31
As Introduced
E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all 834
assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the 835
effective date of termination, including obligations that extend 836
beyond the effective date of termination, if necessary. 837
F. Upon the termination of a State's membership from this 838
Compact, that State shall immediately provide notice to all 839
Licensees and Compact Privilege holders (of which the Commission 840
has a record) within that State of such termination. The 841
terminated State shall continue to recognize all licenses 842
granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of one hundred 843
eighty (180) days after the date of said notice of termination. 844
G. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a 845
State that is found to be in default or that has been terminated 846
from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the 847
Commission and the defaulting State. 848
H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the 849
Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the 850
District of Columbia or the federal district where the 851
Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall 852
be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable 853
attorney's fees. 854
I. Dispute Resolution 855
1. Upon request by a Member State, the Commission shall 856
attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise 857
among Member States and between Member and non-Member States. 858
2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for 859
both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as 860
appropriate. 861
J. Enforcement 862

S. B. No. 149 Page 32
As Introduced
1. By majority vote, as may be further provided by Rule, 863
the Commission may initiate legal action against a Member State 864
in default in the United States District Court for the District 865
of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its 866
principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of 867
the Compact and its promulgated Rules. A Member State by 868
enactment of this Compact consents to venue and jurisdiction in 869
such court for the purposes set forth herein. The relief sought 870
may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event 871
judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be 872
awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable 873
attorney's fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive 874
remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other 875
remedies available under federal or the defaulting Member 876
State's law. 877
2. A Member State may initiate legal action against the 878
Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of 879
Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its 880
principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of 881
the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may 882
include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event 883
judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be 884
awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable 885
attorney's fees. 886
3. No person other than a Member State shall enforce this 887
Compact against the Commission. 888
SECTION 11. EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT 889
A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which 890
the Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh Member 891
State ("Effective Date"). 892

S. B. No. 149 Page 33
As Introduced
1. On or after the Effective Date of the Compact, the 893
Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the 894
first seven Member States ("Charter Member States") to determine 895
if the statute enacted by each such Charter Member State is 896
materially different than the Model Compact. 897
a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to be 898
materially different from the Model Compact shall be entitled to 899
the default process set forth in Section 10. 900
b. If any Member State is later found to be in default, or 901
is terminated or withdraws from the Compact, the Commission 902
shall remain in existence and the Compact shall remain in effect 903
even if the number of Member States should be less than seven. 904
2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the 905
seven initial Charter Member States shall be subject to the 906
process set forth herein and Commission Rule to determine if 907
their enactments are materially different from the Model Compact 908
and whether they qualify for participation in the Compact. 909
3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or 910
in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the 911
Compact prior to the effective date of the Compact or the 912
Commission coming into existence shall be considered to be 913
actions of the Commission unless specifically repudiated by the 914
Commission. The Commission shall own and have all rights to any 915
intellectual property developed on behalf or in furtherance of 916
the Commission by individuals or entities involved in organizing 917
or establishing the Commission, as may be further set forth in 918
Rules of the Commission. 919
4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the 920
Commission's initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be 921

S. B. No. 149 Page 34
As Introduced
subject to the Rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on 922
which the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule that has 923
been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full 924
force and effect of law on the date the Compact becomes law in 925
that State. 926
B. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by 927
enacting a statute repealing the same. 928
1. A Member State's withdrawal shall not take effect until 929
one hundred eighty (180) days after enactment of the repealing 930
statute. 931
2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement 932
of the withdrawing State's Respiratory Therapy Licensing 933
Authority to comply with the investigative and Adverse Action 934
reporting requirements of this Compact prior to the effective 935
date of withdrawal. 936
3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this 937
Compact, a State shall immediately provide notice of such 938
withdrawal to all Licensees and Compact Privilege holders (of 939
which the Commission has a record) within that State. 940
Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the 941
contrary, such withdrawing State shall continue to recognize all 942
licenses granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of one 943
hundred eighty (180) days after the date of such notice of 944
withdrawal. 945
C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to 946
invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other 947
cooperative arrangement between a Member State and a non-Member 948
State that does not conflict with the provisions of this 949
Compact. 950

S. B. No. 149 Page 35
As Introduced
D. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No 951
amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding 952
upon any Member State until it is enacted into the laws of all 953
Member States. 954
SECTION 12. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY 955
A. This Compact and the Commission's rulemaking authority 956
shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes 957
and the implementation and administration of the Compact. 958
Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the 959
promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to limit the 960
Commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes. 961
B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable, and 962
if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is 963
held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the 964
constitution of any Member State, a State seeking participation 965
in the Compact, or of the United States, or the applicability 966
thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is 967
held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent 968
jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and 969
the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, 970
person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. 971
C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, the 972
Commission may deny a State's participation in the Compact or, 973
in accordance with the requirements of Section 10, terminate a 974
Member State's participation in the Compact, if it determines 975
that a constitutional requirement of a Member State is a 976
material departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact 977
shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any Member 978
State, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to 979
the remaining Member States and in full force and effect as to 980

S. B. No. 149 Page 36
As Introduced
the Member State affected as to all severable matters. 981
SECTION 13. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER 982
STATE LAWS 983
A. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement 984
of any other law of a Member State that is not inconsistent with 985
the Compact. 986
B. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal 987
requirements in a Member State in conflict with the Compact are 988
superseded to the extent of the conflict, including any 989
subsequently enacted State laws. 990
C. All permissible agreements between the Commission and 991
the Member States are binding in accordance with their terms. 992
D. Other than as expressly set forth herein, nothing in 993
this Compact will impact initial licensure. 994
Sec. 4761.21. Not later than sixty days after the 995
"Respiratory Care Interstate Compact" is entered into under 996
section 4761.20 of the Revised Code, the state medical board, in 997
accordance with Section 7 of the compact, shall select one 998
individual to serve as a commissioner on the respiratory care 999
interstate compact commission created under the compact. The 1000
board shall fill a vacancy in this position not later than sixty 1001
days after the vacancy occurs. 1002
