(C) Interest on a refund applied for under this section, 2731
computed at the rate provided for in section 5703.47 of the 2732

If a taxpayer entitled to a refund under section 3779.43 2751
of the Revised Code owes any debt to this state, the amount 2752
refundable may be applied in satisfaction of the debt. If the 2753
amount refundable is less than the amount of the debt, it may be 2754
applied in partial satisfaction of the debt. If the amount 2755
refundable is greater than the amount of the debt, the amount 2756
remaining after satisfaction of the debt shall be refunded. This 2757

Section 253:
section applies only to debts that have become final. For the 2758
purposes of this section, a debt becomes final when, under the 2759
applicable law, any time provided for petition for reassessment, 2760
request for reconsideration, or other appeal of the legality or 2761

Code. With the notice, the commissioner shall provide 2770

and request a hearing with respect to the petition. 2772
(B) Unless the person assessed, within sixty days after 2773
service of the notice of assessment, files with the 2774
commissioner, either personally or by certified mail, a written 2775
petition signed by the person or the person's authorized agent 2776
having knowledge of the facts, the assessment becomes final, and 2777
the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the person 2778
assessed to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate 2779
Sub. S. B. No. 56 Page 98
As Reported by the House Judiciary Committee
the objections of the person assessed, but additional objections 2780
may be raised in writing if received by the commissioner before 2781
the date shown on the final determination. 2782
If a petition for reassessment has been properly filed, 2783
the commissioner shall proceed under section 5703.60 of the 2784
Revised Code. 2785
(C)(1) After an assessment becomes final, if any portion 2786
of the assessment, including accrued interest, remains unpaid, a 2787
certified copy of the commissioner's entry making the assessment 2788
final may be filed in the office of the clerk of the court of 2789
common pleas in the county in which the person resides or has 2790
its principal place of business in this state, or in the office 2791
of the clerk of the court of common pleas of Franklin county. 2792
(2) Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk 2793
shall enter judgment for the state against the person assessed 2794
in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment may be filed by 2795
the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for 2796
the intoxicating hemp product receipts tax" or "special 2797
judgments for the drinkable cannabinoid product tax," as 2798
applicable, and shall have the same effect as other judgments. 2799
Execution shall issue upon the judgment at the request of the 2800
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution 2801
shall apply to sales made under the judgment. 2802
(3) If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within 2803
sixty days after the day the assessment was issued, the portion 2804
of the assessment consisting of tax due shall bear interest at 2805
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised 2806
Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until 2807
it is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for 2808
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever 2809
Sub. S. B. No. 56 Page 99
As Reported by the House Judiciary Committee
comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is 2810
certified to the attorney general for collection, the entire 2811
unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at the rate 2812
per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from 2813
the date of certification until the date it is paid in its 2814
entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax 2815
imposed by division (B) or (C) of section 3779.40 of the Revised 2816
Code, as applicable, and may be collected by the issuance of an 2817
assessment under this section. 2818
(D) If the commissioner believes that collection of a tax 2819
imposed by this chapter will be jeopardized unless proceedings 2820
to collect or secure collection of the tax is instituted without 2821
delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment against 2822
the person liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of 2823
the jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry 2824
with the clerk of the court of common pleas in the manner 2825
prescribed by division (C) of this section. Notice of the 2826
jeopardy assessment shall be served on the person assessed or 2827
the person's authorized agent in the manner provided in section 2828

Section 254:
5703.37 of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of 2829
the entry with the clerk. The total amount assessed is 2830
immediately due and payable unless the person assessed files a 2831
petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of 2832
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the 2833
commissioner and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid 2834
balance of the assessment. Full or partial payment of the 2835
assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's consideration 2836
of the petition for reassessment. 2837
(E) The commissioner shall immediately forward to the 2838
treasurer of state all amounts the commissioner receives under 2839
this section, and such amounts shall be considered as revenue 2840

the tax was reported, or more than four years after the return 2847
for the tax period was filed, whichever is later. The time limit 2848
may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner 2849
consent in writing to the extension or enter into an agreement 2850
waiving or extending the time limit. Any such extension shall 2851
extend the four-year time limit in division (A) of section 2852

Section 256:
3779.43 of the Revised Code for the same period of time. Nothing 2853
in this division bars an assessment against a taxpayer that 2854
fails to file a return required under section 3779.41 of the 2855
Revised Code or that files a fraudulent return. 2856
(G) If the commissioner possesses information that 2857
indicates that the amount of tax a taxpayer is required to pay 2858
under division (B) or (C) of section 3779.40 of the Revised Code 2859
exceeds the amount the taxpayer paid, the commissioner may audit 2860
a sample of the taxpayer's sales over a representative period of 2861
time to ascertain the amount of tax due, and may issue an 2862
assessment based on the audit. The commissioner shall make a 2863
good faith effort to reach agreement with the taxpayer in 2864
selecting a representative sample. The commissioner may apply a 2865
sampling method only if the commissioner has prescribed the 2866
method by rule. 2867
(H) If the whereabouts of a person subject to this chapter 2868
is not known to the tax commissioner, the commissioner shall 2869

person shall pay the tax due under this chapter, including any 2877
applicable penalties and interest, within forty-five days after 2878
the date of selling or quitting the trade or business. The 2879
person's successor shall withhold a sufficient amount of the 2880
purchase money to cover the amount due and unpaid until the 2881
former owner produces a receipt from the tax commissioner 2882
showing that the amounts are paid or a certificate indicating 2883
that no tax is due. If a purchaser fails to withhold purchase 2884
money, that person is personally liable, up to the purchase 2885
money amount, for such amounts that are unpaid during the 2886
operation of the business by the former owner. 2887
The commissioner may adopt rules regarding the issuance of 2888

commence an action in quo warranto in the court of appeals of 2898
the county in which the person resides or has its principal 2899
place of business to forfeit and annul the person's licenses 2900
issued under section 3779.03 of the Revised Code. If the court 2901
Sub. S. B. No. 56 Page 102

finds that the person is in default for the amount claimed, it 2902
shall render judgment revoking the person's registration and 2903
shall otherwise proceed as provided in Chapter 2733. of the 2904
Revised Code. 2905
Sec. 3779.46. (A) The tax commissioner may prescribe 2906
requirements for the keeping of records and other pertinent 2907
documents, the filing of copies of federal income tax returns 2908
and determinations, and computations reconciling federal income 2909
tax returns with the returns required by section 3779.41 of the 2910
Revised Code. The commissioner may require any person, by rule 2911
or notice served on that person, to keep those records that the 2912
commissioner considers necessary to show whether, and the extent 2913
to which, a person is subject to a tax levied under section 2914

payment from the tax refund fund created under section 5703.052 2727
of the Revised Code. If the amount is less than that claimed, 2728
the commissioner shall proceed in accordance with section 2729
5703.70 of the Revised Code. 2730
(C) Interest on a refund applied for under this section, 2731
computed at the rate provided for in section 5703.47 of the 2732
Revised Code, shall be allowed from the later of the date the 2733
amount was paid or when the payment was due. 2734
(D) Except as provided in section 3779.431 of the Revised 2735
Code, the commissioner may, with the consent of the taxpayer, 2736
provide for the crediting, against tax due for any month, of the 2737
amount of any refund due to the taxpayer under this section for 2738
a preceding month. 2739
Sec. 3779.431. As used in this section, "debt to this 2740
state" means unpaid taxes due the state, unpaid workers' 2741
compensation premiums due under section 4123.35 of the Revised 2742
Code, unpaid unemployment compensation contributions due under 2743

arising from any of the foregoing. 2750
If a taxpayer entitled to a refund under section 3779.43 2751
of the Revised Code owes any debt to this state, the amount 2752
refundable may be applied in satisfaction of the debt. If the 2753
amount refundable is less than the amount of the debt, it may be 2754
applied in partial satisfaction of the debt. If the amount 2755
refundable is greater than the amount of the debt, the amount 2756
remaining after satisfaction of the debt shall be refunded. This 2757
section applies only to debts that have become final. For the 2758
purposes of this section, a debt becomes final when, under the 2759
applicable law, any time provided for petition for reassessment, 2760
request for reconsideration, or other appeal of the legality or 2761
validity of the amount giving rise to the debt expires without 2762
an appeal having been filed in the manner provided by law. 2763
Sec. 3779.44. (A) The tax commissioner may make an 2764
assessment, based on any information in the commissioner's 2765
possession, against any person that fails to file a return or 2766
pay tax as required under section 3779.41 of the Revised Code. 2767
The commissioner shall give the person assessed written notice 2768
of the assessment as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised 2769
Code. With the notice, the commissioner shall provide 2770
instructions on the manner in which to petition for reassessment 2771
and request a hearing with respect to the petition. 2772
(B) Unless the person assessed, within sixty days after 2773
service of the notice of assessment, files with the 2774
commissioner, either personally or by certified mail, a written 2775
petition signed by the person or the person's authorized agent 2776
having knowledge of the facts, the assessment becomes final, and 2777
the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the person 2778
assessed to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate 2779

Sub. S. B. No. 56 Page 98
As Reported by the House Judiciary Committee
the objections of the person assessed, but additional objections 2780
may be raised in writing if received by the commissioner before 2781
the date shown on the final determination. 2782
If a petition for reassessment has been properly filed, 2783
the commissioner shall proceed under section 5703.60 of the 2784
Revised Code. 2785
(C)(1) After an assessment becomes final, if any portion 2786
of the assessment, including accrued interest, remains unpaid, a 2787
certified copy of the commissioner's entry making the assessment 2788
final may be filed in the office of the clerk of the court of 2789
common pleas in the county in which the person resides or has 2790
its principal place of business in this state, or in the office 2791
of the clerk of the court of common pleas of Franklin county. 2792
(2) Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk 2793
shall enter judgment for the state against the person assessed 2794
in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment may be filed by 2795
the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for 2796
the intoxicating hemp product receipts tax" or "special 2797
judgments for the drinkable cannabinoid product tax," as 2798
applicable, and shall have the same effect as other judgments. 2799
Execution shall issue upon the judgment at the request of the 2800
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution 2801
shall apply to sales made under the judgment. 2802
(3) If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within 2803
sixty days after the day the assessment was issued, the portion 2804
of the assessment consisting of tax due shall bear interest at 2805
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised 2806
Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until 2807
it is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for 2808
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever 2809

Sub. S. B. No. 56 Page 99
As Reported by the House Judiciary Committee
comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is 2810
certified to the attorney general for collection, the entire 2811
unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at the rate 2812
per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from 2813
the date of certification until the date it is paid in its 2814
entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax 2815
imposed by division (B) or (C) of section 3779.40 of the Revised 2816
Code, as applicable, and may be collected by the issuance of an 2817
assessment under this section. 2818
(D) If the commissioner believes that collection of a tax 2819
imposed by this chapter will be jeopardized unless proceedings 2820
to collect or secure collection of the tax is instituted without 2821
delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment against 2822
the person liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of 2823
the jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry 2824
with the clerk of the court of common pleas in the manner 2825
prescribed by division (C) of this section. Notice of the 2826
jeopardy assessment shall be served on the person assessed or 2827
the person's authorized agent in the manner provided in section 2828
5703.37 of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of 2829
the entry with the clerk. The total amount assessed is 2830
immediately due and payable unless the person assessed files a 2831
petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of 2832
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the 2833
commissioner and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid 2834
balance of the assessment. Full or partial payment of the 2835
assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's consideration 2836
of the petition for reassessment. 2837
(E) The commissioner shall immediately forward to the 2838
treasurer of state all amounts the commissioner receives under 2839
this section, and such amounts shall be considered as revenue 2840

Sub. S. B. No. 56 Page 100
As Reported by the House Judiciary Committee
arising from the tax imposed under division (B) or (C) of 2841
section 3779.40 of the Revised Code, as applicable. 2842
(F) Except as otherwise provided in this division, no 2843
assessment shall be made or issued against a taxpayer for a tax 2844
imposed under this chapter more than four years after the due 2845
date for the filing of the return for the tax period for which 2846
the tax was reported, or more than four years after the return 2847
for the tax period was filed, whichever is later. The time limit 2848
may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner 2849
consent in writing to the extension or enter into an agreement 2850
waiving or extending the time limit. Any such extension shall 2851
extend the four-year time limit in division (A) of section 2852
3779.43 of the Revised Code for the same period of time. Nothing 2853
in this division bars an assessment against a taxpayer that 2854
fails to file a return required under section 3779.41 of the 2855
Revised Code or that files a fraudulent return. 2856
(G) If the commissioner possesses information that 2857
indicates that the amount of tax a taxpayer is required to pay 2858
under division (B) or (C) of section 3779.40 of the Revised Code 2859
exceeds the amount the taxpayer paid, the commissioner may audit 2860
a sample of the taxpayer's sales over a representative period of 2861
time to ascertain the amount of tax due, and may issue an 2862
assessment based on the audit. The commissioner shall make a 2863
good faith effort to reach agreement with the taxpayer in 2864
selecting a representative sample. The commissioner may apply a 2865
sampling method only if the commissioner has prescribed the 2866
method by rule. 2867
(H) If the whereabouts of a person subject to this chapter 2868
is not known to the tax commissioner, the commissioner shall 2869
follow the procedures under section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. 2870

Sub. S. B. No. 56 Page 101

Sec. 3779.45. If any person liable for a tax imposed unde r 2871
section 3779.40 of the Revised Code sells the trade or business, 2872
disposes in any manner other than in the regular course of 2873
business at least seventy-five per cent of assets of the trade 2874
or business, or quits the trade or business, any tax owed by 2875
such person shall become due and payable immediately, and the 2876
person shall pay the tax due under this chapter, including any 2877
applicable penalties and interest, within forty-five days after 2878
the date of selling or quitting the trade or business. The 2879
person's successor shall withhold a sufficient amount of the 2880
purchase money to cover the amount due and unpaid until the 2881
former owner produces a receipt from the tax commissioner 2882
showing that the amounts are paid or a certificate indicating 2883
that no tax is due. If a purchaser fails to withhold purchase 2884
money, that person is personally liable, up to the purchase 2885
money amount, for such amounts that are unpaid during the 2886
operation of the business by the former owner. 2887
The commissioner may adopt rules regarding the issuance of 2888
certificates under this section, including the waiver of the 2889
need for a certificate if certain criteria are met. 2890
Sec. 3779.451. If any person subject to the tax levied 2891
under division (B) of section 3779.40 of the Revised Code fails 2892
to report or pay the tax as required under section 3779.41 of 2893
the Revised Code, or fails to pay any penalty imposed under 2894
sections 3779.40 to 3779.48 of the Revised Code within ninety 2895
days after the time prescribed for payment of the penalty, the 2896
attorney general, on the request of the tax commissioner, shall 2897
commence an action in quo warranto in the court of appeals of 2898
the county in which the person resides or has its principal 2899
place of business to forfeit and annul the person's licenses 2900
issued under section 3779.03 of the Revised Code. If the court 2901

Sub. S. B. No. 56 Page 102
As Reported by the House Judiciary Committee
finds that the person is in default for the amount claimed, it 2902
shall render judgment revoking the person's registration and 2903
shall otherwise proceed as provided in Chapter 2733. of the 2904
Revised Code. 2905
Sec. 3779.46. (A) The tax commissioner may prescribe 2906
requirements for the keeping of records and other pertinent 2907
documents, the filing of copies of federal income tax returns 2908
and determinations, and computations reconciling federal income 2909
tax returns with the returns required by section 3779.41 of the 2910
Revised Code. The commissioner may require any person, by rule 2911
or notice served on that person, to keep those records that the 2912
commissioner considers necessary to show whether, and the extent 2913
to which, a person is subject to a tax levied under section 2914
3779.40 of the Revised Code. 2915
(B) Each taxpayer shall maintain complete and accurate 2916
records of all sales and other dispositions of intoxicating hemp 2917
products or drinkable cannabinoid products, as applicable, and 2918
shall procure and retain all invoices, bills of lading, and 2919
other documents relating to the sales and other dispositions of 2920
such products. No person shall make a false entry upon any 2921
invoice or record upon which an entry is required by this 2922
section, and no person shall present any false entry for the 2923
inspection of the commissioner with the intent to evade a tax 2924
levied under section 3779.40 of the Revised Code. 2925
(C) The records described in divisions (A) and (B) of this 2926
section and other documents shall be open during business hours 2927
to the inspection of the commissioner, and shall be preserved 2928
for a period of four years, unless the commissioner, in writing, 2929
consents to their destruction within that period, or by order 2930
requires that they be kept for a longer period. If such records 2931

Sub. S. B. No. 56 Page 103
As Reported by the House Judiciary Committee
are normally kept by the person electronically, the person shall 2932
provide such records to the commissioner electronically at the 2933
commissioner's request. 2934

this chapter is confidential as provided for in section 5703.21 2936

required to remit a tax under section 3779.40 of the Revised 2939
Code, including legal names, trade names, addresses, and account 2940
numbers. In addition, the list shall include all persons that 2941
canceled their registrations at any time during the preceding 2942
four calendar years, including the effective date of the 2943
cancellation. 2944
Sec. 3779.47. (A) No person shall prepare for shipment, 2945
ship, transport, deliver, prepare for distribution, distribute, 2946
or sell intoxicating hemp products or drinkable cannabinoid 2947
products, or otherwise engage or participate in the business of 2948
selling intoxicating hemp products or drinkable cannabinoid 2949
products, with the intent to avoid payment of a tax levied by 2950
section 3779.40 of the Revised Code. 2951
(B) The tax commissioner or an agent of the commissioner 2952
may enter and inspect the facilities and records of a person 2953
selling intoxicating hemp products or drinkable cannabinoid 2954
products. Such entrance and inspection requires a properly 2955
issued search warrant if conducted outside the normal business 2956
hours of the person, but does not require a search warrant if 2957
conducted during the normal business hours of the person. No 2958
person shall prevent or hinder the commissioner or an agent of 2959
the commissioner from carrying out the authority granted under 2960
this division. 2961

(C) Whenever the commissioner discovers intoxicating hemp 2962
products or drinkable cannabinoid products that are subject to a 2963
tax levied by this chapter and upon which the tax has not been 2964
or will not be paid or the commissioner has reason to believe 2965
the tax is being avoided, the commissioner may seize and take 2966
possession of the products, which, upon seizure, shall be 2967
forfeited to the state. Within a reasonable time after seizure, 2968
the commissioner may sell the products. From the proceeds of 2969
this sale, the commissioner shall pay the costs incurred in the 2970
seizure and sale, and any proceeds remaining after the sale 2971
shall be considered as revenue arising from the tax. The seizure 2972
and sale do not relieve any person from the fine or imprisonment 2973
provided for a violation of this chapter. The commissioner shall 2974
make the sale where it is most convenient and economical, but 2975
may order the destruction of forfeited products if the quantity 2976
or quality is not sufficient to warrant its sale. 2977
Sec. 3779.48. (A) Any person that is not a taxpayer 2978
registered under section 3779.40 of the Revised Code is liable 2979
for any amounts, including tax, interest, and penalties, imposed 2980
by sections 3779.40 to 3779.48 of the Revised Code in the same 2981
manner as persons that do hold such a registration are liable, 2982
if the person does either of the following: 2983
(1) Receives intoxicating hemp product receipts from the 2984
retail sale of intoxicating hemp; 2985
(2) Sells drinkable cannabinoid products upon which the 2986

(B) Any rules that are pending before the Common Sense 6424
Initiative or the Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review on the 6425
effective date of this section that were proposed by the 6426
Division of Cannabis Control under Chapter 3780. of the Revised 6427
Code, as that chapter existed immediately before the effective 6428
date of this section, shall be treated as having been proposed 6429
by the Division of Marijuana Control under Chapter 3796. of the 6430
Revised Code. 6431
(C) Notwithstanding any provision of section 121.95 of the 6432
Revised Code to the contrary, a regulatory restriction contained 6433
in a rule adopted by the Division of Marijuana Control in 6434
accordance with Chapter 3796. of the Revised Code, as amended by 6435
this act, during the period beginning on the effective date of 6436
this section and ending twelve months after that date is not 6437
subject to sections 121.95 to 121.953 of the Revised Code. 6438
Section 6. If any provision of a section of this act or 6439
the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held 6440
invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or 6441
applications of the section or related sections that can be 6442
given effect without the invalid provision or application, and 6443
to this end the provisions are severable. 6444
Section 7. Section 519.21 of the Revised Code is presented 6445
in this act as a composite of the section as amended by both 6446
H.B. 523 and S.B. 75 of the 131st General Assembly. The General 6447
Assembly, applying the principle stated in division (B) of 6448
section 1.52 of the Revised Code that amendments are to be 6449
harmonized if reasonably capable of simultaneous operation, 6450
finds that the composite is the resulting version of the section 6451
in effect prior to the effective date of the section as 6452
