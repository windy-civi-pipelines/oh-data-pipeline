Code, together with remittance of the tax due. In the case of 2666
the tax levied under division (B) of section 3779.40 of the 2667
Revised Code, the tax shall be calculated on the basis of the 2668
taxpayer's intoxicating hemp product receipts received during 2669
the preceding month. In the case of the tax levied under 2670
division (C) of section 3779.40 of the Revised Code, the tax 2671

(2) Any delinquent payments made after a taxpayer is 2683
notified of an audit or a tax discrepancy by the commissioner 2684
are subject to the penalty imposed by division (C)(1) of this 2685
section. If an assessment is issued under section 3779.44 of the 2686

Sub. S. B. No. 56 Page 95
As Passed by the House
Revised Code in connection with such delinquent payments, the 2687
payments shall be credited to the assessment. 2688
(D) The commissioner may collect any penalty or interest 2689
imposed by this section or section 3779.40 of the Revised Code 2690
in the same manner as the applicable tax imposed under that 2691
section. Penalties and interest so collected shall be considered 2692
as revenue arising from that tax. 2693
(E) The commissioner may abate all or a portion of any 2694
penalties imposed under this section or section 3779.40 of the 2695
Revised Code and may adopt rules governing such abatements. 2696

prescribed under this section, the taxpayer shall pay interest, 2698
calculated at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 2699

whichever occurs first. 2702

under section 3779.41 of the Revised Code shall remit each tax 2707
payment, and, if required by the tax commissioner, file the tax 2708
return or the annual report, electronically. The commissioner 2709
may require taxpayers to use the Ohio business gateway as 2710
defined in section 718.01 of the Revised Code to file returns 2711
and remit the taxes, or may provide another means for taxpayers 2712
to file and remit the taxes electronically. 2713

be excused from that requirement. The commissioner may excuse a 2717
taxpayer from the requirements of this section for good cause. 2718
(C)(1) If a taxpayer required to remit tax or file a 2719
return electronically under division (A) of this section fails 2720
to do so, the commissioner may impose a penalty not to exceed 2721
the following: 2722
(a) For either of the first two months the taxpayer so 2723
fails, the greater of twenty-five dollars or five per cent of 2724

(b) For the third and any subsequent months the taxpayer 2726
so fails, the greater of fifty dollars or ten per cent of the 2727
amount of the payment that was required to be remitted. 2728
(2) The penalty imposed under division (C)(1) of this 2729
section shall be considered as revenue arising from the tax 2730
imposed under division (B) or (C) of section 3779.40 of the 2731
Revised Code, as applicable. A penalty may be collected by 2732
assessment in the manner prescribed by section 3779.44 of the 2733
Revised Code. The commissioner may abate all or a portion of 2734
such a penalty. 2735
(D) The commissioner may adopt rules necessary to 2736
administer this section. 2737
Sec. 3779.43. (A) An application for refund to the 2738
taxpayer of amounts imposed under sections 3779.40 to 3779.48 of 2739
the Revised Code that are overpaid, paid illegally or 2740

Sub. S. B. No. 56 Page 97
As Passed by the House
additional period allowed under division (F) of section 3779.44 2745
of the Revised Code. The applicant shall provide the amount of 2746
the requested refund along with the claimed reasons for, and 2747
documentation to support, the issuance of a refund. 2748
(B) On the filing of the refund application, the 2749
commissioner shall determine the amount of refund to which the 2750
applicant is entitled. If the amount is not less than that 2751
claimed, the commissioner shall certify the amount to the 2752
director of budget and management and treasurer of state for 2753
payment from the tax refund fund created under section 5703.052 2754
of the Revised Code. If the amount is less than that claimed, 2755
the commissioner shall proceed in accordance with section 2756
5703.70 of the Revised Code. 2757
(C) Interest on a refund applied for under this section, 2758
computed at the rate provided for in section 5703.47 of the 2759
Revised Code, shall be allowed from the later of the date the 2760
amount was paid or when the payment was due. 2761
(D) Except as provided in section 3779.431 of the Revised 2762
Code, the commissioner may, with the consent of the taxpayer, 2763
provide for the crediting, against tax due for any month, of the 2764
amount of any refund due to the taxpayer under this section for 2765
a preceding month. 2766
Sec. 3779.431. As used in this section, "debt to this 2767
state" means unpaid taxes due the state, unpaid workers' 2768
compensation premiums due under section 4123.35 of the Revised 2769
Code, unpaid unemployment compensation contributions due under 2770
section 4141.25 of the Revised Code, unpaid unemployment 2771

As Passed by the House
Revised Code, incorrect payments for medicaid services under the 2775
medicaid program, or any unpaid charge, penalty, or interest 2776
arising from any of the foregoing. 2777
If a taxpayer entitled to a refund under section 3779.43 2778
of the Revised Code owes any debt to this state, the amount 2779
refundable may be applied in satisfaction of the debt. If the 2780
amount refundable is less than the amount of the debt, it may be 2781
applied in partial satisfaction of the debt. If the amount 2782
refundable is greater than the amount of the debt, the amount 2783
remaining after satisfaction of the debt shall be refunded. This 2784
section applies only to debts that have become final. For the 2785
purposes of this section, a debt becomes final when, under the 2786
applicable law, any time provided for petition for reassessment, 2787
request for reconsideration, or other appeal of the legality or 2788
validity of the amount giving rise to the debt expires without 2789
an appeal having been filed in the manner provided by law. 2790
Sec. 3779.44. (A) The tax commissioner may make an 2791
assessment, based on any information in the commissioner's 2792
possession, against any person that fails to file a return or 2793
pay tax as required under section 3779.41 of the Revised Code. 2794
The commissioner shall give the person assessed written notice 2795
of the assessment as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised 2796
Code. With the notice, the commissioner shall provide 2797
instructions on the manner in which to petition for reassessment 2798
and request a hearing with respect to the petition. 2799
(B) Unless the person assessed, within sixty days after 2800
service of the notice of assessment, files with the 2801
commissioner, either personally or by certified mail, a written 2802
petition signed by the person or the person's authorized agent 2803
having knowledge of the facts, the assessment becomes final, and 2804

Sub. S. B. No. 56 Page 99
As Passed by the House
the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the person 2805
assessed to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate 2806
the objections of the person assessed, but additional objections 2807
may be raised in writing if received by the commissioner before 2808
the date shown on the final determination. 2809
If a petition for reassessment has been properly filed, 2810
the commissioner shall proceed under section 5703.60 of the 2811
Revised Code. 2812
(C)(1) After an assessment becomes final, if any portion 2813
of the assessment, including accrued interest, remains unpaid, a 2814
certified copy of the commissioner's entry making the assessment 2815
final may be filed in the office of the clerk of the court of 2816
common pleas in the county in which the person resides or has 2817
its principal place of business in this state, or in the office 2818
of the clerk of the court of common pleas of Franklin county. 2819
(2) Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk 2820
shall enter judgment for the state against the person assessed 2821
in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment may be filed by 2822
the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for 2823
the intoxicating hemp product receipts tax" or "special 2824
judgments for the drinkable cannabinoid product tax," as 2825
applicable, and shall have the same effect as other judgments. 2826
Execution shall issue upon the judgment at the request of the 2827
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution 2828
shall apply to sales made under the judgment. 2829
(3) If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within 2830
sixty days after the day the assessment was issued, the portion 2831
of the assessment consisting of tax due shall bear interest at 2832
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised 2833
Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until 2834

Sub. S. B. No. 56 Page 100
As Passed by the House
it is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for 2835
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever 2836
comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is 2837
certified to the attorney general for collection, the entire 2838
unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at the rate 2839
per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from 2840
the date of certification until the date it is paid in its 2841
entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax 2842
imposed by division (B) or (C) of section 3779.40 of the Revised 2843
Code, as applicable, and may be collected by the issuance of an 2844
assessment under this section. 2845
(D) If the commissioner believes that collection of a tax 2846
imposed by this chapter will be jeopardized unless proceedings 2847
to collect or secure collection of the tax is instituted without 2848
delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment against 2849
the person liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of 2850
the jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry 2851
with the clerk of the court of common pleas in the manner 2852
prescribed by division (C) of this section. Notice of the 2853
jeopardy assessment shall be served on the person assessed or 2854
the person's authorized agent in the manner provided in section 2855
5703.37 of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of 2856
the entry with the clerk. The total amount assessed is 2857
immediately due and payable unless the person assessed files a 2858
petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of 2859
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the 2860
commissioner and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid 2861
balance of the assessment. Full or partial payment of the 2862
assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's consideration 2863
of the petition for reassessment. 2864
(E) The commissioner shall immediately forward to the 2865

Sub. S. B. No. 56 Page 101
As Passed by the House
treasurer of state all amounts the commissioner receives under 2866
this section, and such amounts shall be considered as revenue 2867
arising from the tax imposed under division (B) or (C) of 2868
section 3779.40 of the Revised Code, as applicable. 2869
(F) Except as otherwise provided in this division, no 2870
assessment shall be made or issued against a taxpayer for a tax 2871
imposed under this chapter more than four years after the due 2872
date for the filing of the return for the tax period for which 2873
the tax was reported, or more than four years after the return 2874
for the tax period was filed, whichever is later. The time limit 2875
may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner 2876
consent in writing to the extension or enter into an agreement 2877
waiving or extending the time limit. Any such extension shall 2878
extend the four-year time limit in division (A) of section 2879
3779.43 of the Revised Code for the same period of time. Nothing 2880
in this division bars an assessment against a taxpayer that 2881
fails to file a return required under section 3779.41 of the 2882
Revised Code or that files a fraudulent return. 2883
(G) If the commissioner possesses information that 2884
indicates that the amount of tax a taxpayer is required to pay 2885
under division (B) or (C) of section 3779.40 of the Revised Code 2886
exceeds the amount the taxpayer paid, the commissioner may audit 2887
a sample of the taxpayer's sales over a representative period of 2888
time to ascertain the amount of tax due, and may issue an 2889
assessment based on the audit. The commissioner shall make a 2890
good faith effort to reach agreement with the taxpayer in 2891
selecting a representative sample. The commissioner may apply a 2892
sampling method only if the commissioner has prescribed the 2893
method by rule. 2894
(H) If the whereabouts of a person subject to this chapter 2895

Sub. S. B. No. 56 Page 102
As Passed by the House
is not known to the tax commissioner, the commissioner shall 2896
follow the procedures under section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. 2897
Sec. 3779.45. If any person liable for a tax imposed unde r 2898
section 3779.40 of the Revised Code sells the trade or business, 2899
disposes in any manner other than in the regular course of 2900
business at least seventy-five per cent of assets of the trade 2901
or business, or quits the trade or business, any tax owed by 2902
such person shall become due and payable immediately, and the 2903
person shall pay the tax due under this chapter, including any 2904
applicable penalties and interest, within forty-five days after 2905
the date of selling or quitting the trade or business. The 2906
person's successor shall withhold a sufficient amount of the 2907
purchase money to cover the amount due and unpaid until the 2908
former owner produces a receipt from the tax commissioner 2909
showing that the amounts are paid or a certificate indicating 2910
that no tax is due. If a purchaser fails to withhold purchase 2911
money, that person is personally liable, up to the purchase 2912
money amount, for such amounts that are unpaid during the 2913
operation of the business by the former owner. 2914
The commissioner may adopt rules regarding the issuance of 2915
certificates under this section, including the waiver of the 2916
need for a certificate if certain criteria are met. 2917
Sec. 3779.451. If any person subject to the tax levied 2918
under division (B) of section 3779.40 of the Revised Code fails 2919
to report or pay the tax as required under section 3779.41 of 2920
the Revised Code, or fails to pay any penalty imposed under 2921
sections 3779.40 to 3779.48 of the Revised Code within ninety 2922
days after the time prescribed for payment of the penalty, the 2923
attorney general, on the request of the tax commissioner, shall 2924

the county in which the person resides or has its principal 2926
place of business to forfeit and annul the person's licenses 2927
issued under section 3779.03 of the Revised Code. If the court 2928
finds that the person is in default for the amount claimed, it 2929
shall render judgment revoking the person's registration and 2930
shall otherwise proceed as provided in Chapter 2733. of the 2931
Revised Code. 2932
Sec. 3779.46. (A) The tax commissioner may prescribe 2933
requirements for the keeping of records and other pertinent 2934
documents, the filing of copies of federal income tax returns 2935
and determinations, and computations reconciling federal income 2936
tax returns with the returns required by section 3779.41 of the 2937
Revised Code. The commissioner may require any person, by rule 2938
or notice served on that person, to keep those records that the 2939
commissioner considers necessary to show whether, and the extent 2940
to which, a person is subject to a tax levied under section 2941
3779.40 of the Revised Code. 2942
(B) Each taxpayer shall maintain complete and accurate 2943
records of all sales and other dispositions of intoxicating hemp 2944
products or drinkable cannabinoid products, as applicable, and 2945
shall procure and retain all invoices, bills of lading, and 2946
other documents relating to the sales and other dispositions of 2947
such products. No person shall make a false entry upon any 2948
invoice or record upon which an entry is required by this 2949
section, and no person shall present any false entry for the 2950
inspection of the commissioner with the intent to evade a tax 2951
levied under section 3779.40 of the Revised Code. 2952
(C) The records described in divisions (A) and (B) of this 2953
section and other documents shall be open during business hours 2954
to the inspection of the commissioner, and shall be preserved 2955

Sub. S. B. No. 56 Page 104
As Passed by the House
for a period of four years, unless the commissioner, in writing, 2956
consents to their destruction within that period, or by order 2957
requires that they be kept for a longer period. If such records 2958
are normally kept by the person electronically, the person shall 2959
provide such records to the commissioner electronically at the 2960
commissioner's request. 2961
(D) Any information acquired by the commissioner under 2962
this chapter is confidential as provided for in section 5703.21 2963
of the Revised Code, except that the commissioner shall make 2964
public an electronic list of all actively registered persons 2965
required to remit a tax under section 3779.40 of the Revised 2966
Code, including legal names, trade names, addresses, and account 2967
numbers. In addition, the list shall include all persons that 2968
canceled their registrations at any time during the preceding 2969
four calendar years, including the effective date of the 2970
cancellation. 2971
Sec. 3779.47. (A) No person shall prepare for shipment, 2972
ship, transport, deliver, prepare for distribution, distribute, 2973
or sell intoxicating hemp products or drinkable cannabinoid 2974
products, or otherwise engage or participate in the business of 2975
selling intoxicating hemp products or drinkable cannabinoid 2976
products, with the intent to avoid payment of a tax levied by 2977
section 3779.40 of the Revised Code. 2978
(B) The tax commissioner or an agent of the commissioner 2979
may enter and inspect the facilities and records of a person 2980
selling intoxicating hemp products or drinkable cannabinoid 2981
products. Such entrance and inspection requires a properly 2982
issued search warrant if conducted outside the normal business 2983
hours of the person, but does not require a search warrant if 2984
conducted during the normal business hours of the person. No 2985

person shall prevent or hinder the commissioner or an agent of 2986
the commissioner from carrying out the authority granted under 2987
this division. 2988
(C) Whenever the commissioner discovers intoxicating hemp 2989
products or drinkable cannabinoid products that are subject to a 2990
tax levied by this chapter and upon which the tax has not been 2991
or will not be paid or the commissioner has reason to believe 2992
the tax is being avoided, the commissioner may seize and take 2993
possession of the products, which, upon seizure, shall be 2994
forfeited to the state. Within a reasonable time after seizure, 2995
the commissioner may sell the products. From the proceeds of 2996
this sale, the commissioner shall pay the costs incurred in the 2997
seizure and sale, and any proceeds remaining after the sale 2998
shall be considered as revenue arising from the tax. The seizure 2999
and sale do not relieve any person from the fine or imprisonment 3000
provided for a violation of this chapter. The commissioner shall 3001
make the sale where it is most convenient and economical, but 3002
may order the destruction of forfeited products if the quantity 3003
or quality is not sufficient to warrant its sale. 3004
Sec. 3779.48. (A) Any person that is not a taxpayer 3005
registered under section 3779.40 of the Revised Code is liable 3006
for any amounts, including tax, interest, and penalties, imposed 3007
by sections 3779.40 to 3779.48 of the Revised Code in the same 3008
manner as persons that do hold such a registration are liable, 3009
if the person does either of the following: 3010
(1) Receives intoxicating hemp product receipts from the 3011
retail sale of intoxicating hemp; 3012
(2) Sells drinkable cannabinoid products upon which the 3013
tax levied by those sections has not been paid. 3014

due under this chapter in the same manner provided under section 3017
3779.44 of the Revised Code. 3018
Sec. 3779.99. (A) Except as provided in division (B) of 3019

(b) If the court finds that the preparer has continually 5971
or repeatedly engaged in prohibited conduct, and that enjoining 5972
the preparer solely from engaging in such conduct would not be 5973
sufficient to prevent the preparer's interference with the 5974
proper administration of any provision of Title LVII of the 5975
Revised Code, the court may issue an injunction against the 5976
preparer enjoining the preparer from acting as a tax return 5977
preparer in this state. 5978
If a tax return preparer has been enjoined from preparing 5979
tax returns or applications for refunds by a federal court or by 5980
another state court in the five years preceding the date on 5981
which an injunction is requested under this section, that prior 5982
injunction shall be sufficient to establish a prima facie case 5983
for the issuance of an injunction under division (B)(2) of this 5984
section. 5985
(C) The commissioner may require a tax return preparer to 5986
include the preparer's name and federal preparer tax 5987
identification number when filing any return or application for 5988
refund. If a tax return preparer fails to include this 5989
information when required to do so by the commissioner, or if 5990
the information provided is false, inaccurate, or incomplete, 5991
the commissioner may impose a penalty of fifty dollars for each 5992
such failure, provided that the maximum penalty imposed on a 5993
preparer under this division in a calendar year shall not exceed 5994
twenty-five thousand dollars. 5995
(D) The penalties imposed under divisions (B)(1) and (C) 5996
of this section may be assessed and collected in the same manner 5997

in an administrative portion of the journal as provided for in 6359
division (L) of section 5703.05 of the Revised Code. When that 6360
journal entry is completed, the employee to whom it pertains, 6361
while engaged within the scope of the employee's duties in 6362
enforcing the provisions of this chapter or Chapter 3779., 6363
5728., 5735., 5739., 5741., or 5747. of the Revised Code, has 6364
the power of a police officer to carry concealed weapons, make 6365

(ii) Pleads guilty to a misdemeanor pursuant to a 6385
negotiated plea agreement as provided in division (D) of section 6386

(b) The tax commissioner shall suspend the delegation of 6390
investigation powers to an employee to whom the delegation was 6391

is convicted, after trial, of a felony. If the employee files an 6393
appeal from that conviction and the conviction is upheld by the 6394
highest court to which the appeal is taken or if the employee 6395
does not file a timely appeal, the commissioner shall revoke the 6396
delegation of investigation powers to that employee. If the 6397
employee files an appeal that results in that employee's 6398
acquittal of the felony or conviction of a misdemeanor, or in 6399
the dismissal of the felony charge against that employee, the 6400
commissioner shall reinstate the delegation of investigation 6401
powers to that employee. The suspension, revocation, and 6402
reinstatement of the delegation of investigation powers to an 6403
employee under division (C)(2) of this section shall be made by 6404
journal entry pursuant to division (B) of this section. An 6405
employee to whom the delegation of investigation powers is 6406
reinstated under division (C)(2)(b) of this section shall not 6407
receive any back pay for the exercise of those investigation 6408
powers unless that employee's conviction of the felony was 6409
reversed on appeal, or the felony charge was dismissed, because 6410
the court found insufficient evidence to convict the employee of 6411
the felony. 6412

Cannabis Control or the Tax Commissioner pursuant to Chapter 6442
3780. of the Revised Code, as that chapter existed immediately 6443
before the effective date of this section, and that are not in 6444
conflict with the requirements of this act, continue in effect 6445
until repealed or amended by the Division of Marijuana Control 6446
or the Tax Commissioner, respectively. At the request of the 6447
Division of Cannabis Control or the Tax Commissioner, the 6448
Director of the Legislative Service Commission shall renumber 6449
rules adopted under Chapter 3780. of the Revised Code to reflect 6450
the transfer of authority to Chapter 3796. of the Revised Code, 6451
as amended by this act. 6452
(B) Any rules that are pending before the Common Sense 6453
Initiative or the Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review on the 6454
effective date of this section that were proposed by the 6455
Division of Cannabis Control under Chapter 3780. of the Revised 6456
Code, as that chapter existed immediately before the effective 6457
date of this section, shall be treated as having been proposed 6458
by the Division of Marijuana Control under Chapter 3796. of the 6459
Revised Code. 6460
(C) Notwithstanding any provision of section 121.95 of the 6461

accordance with Chapter 3796. of the Revised Code, as amended by 6464
this act, during the period beginning on the effective date of 6465
this section and ending twelve months after that date is not 6466

Section 6. If any provision of a section of this act or 6468
the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held 6469

in this act as a composite of the section as amended by both 6475
H.B. 523 and S.B. 75 of the 131st General Assembly. The General 6476
Assembly, applying the principle stated in division (B) of 6477
section 1.52 of the Revised Code that amendments are to be 6478
harmonized if reasonably capable of simultaneous operation, 6479
finds that the composite is the resulting version of the section 6480
