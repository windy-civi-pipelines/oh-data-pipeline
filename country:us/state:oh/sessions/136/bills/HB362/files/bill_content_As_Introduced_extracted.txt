business days after the complaint is filed unless the commission 207
has good cause to hold the hearing after that time, in which 208
case it shall hold the hearing not later than one hundred eighty 209

insufficient for it to determine whether or not the failure to 244
act or the violation alleged in the complaint has occurred, the 245
commission, by the affirmative vote of five members, may request 246
that an investigatory attorney investigate the complaint. Upon 247
that request, an investigatory attorney shall make an 248
investigation in order to produce sufficient evidence for the 249
commission to decide the matter. If the commission requests an 250
investigation under this division, for good cause shown by the 251

3517.21, or division (A) or (B) of section 3517.22 of the 261
Revised Code by clear and convincing evidence. The commission 262
shall make any finding of a failure to comply with or a 263
violation of law in regard to any other complaint by a 264
preponderance of the evidence. 265
(2) If the commission finds a violation of division (B) of 266
section 3517.21 or division (B) of section 3517.22 of the 267
Revised Code, it shall refer the matter to the appropriate 268
prosecutor under division (A)(1)(c) of this section and shall 269
not impose a fine under division (A)(1)(b) of this section or 270
section 3517.993 of the Revised Code. 271
(3) If the commission finds a violation of section 3517.24 272
of the Revised Code, it may impose a fine under section 3517.993 273
of the Revised Code, but it shall not refer the matter to a 274
prosecutor. 275
(E) In an action before the commission or a panel of the 276
commission, if the allegations of the complainant are not 277
proved, and the commission takes the action described in 278
division (A)(1)(a) of this section or a panel of the commission 279
takes the action described in division (C)(1) of section 280
3517.156 of the Revised Code, the commission or a panel of the 281
