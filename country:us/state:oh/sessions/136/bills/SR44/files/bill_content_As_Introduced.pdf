WHEREAS, The Village of Baltimore was formed in 1825, and 5
recognition of its Two Hundredth Anniversary is, indeed, a fitting 6
tribute to this fine community. Over the past two centuries, it has 7
become known for its residents’ cooperation, integrity, and 8
willingness to work hard, and these exemplary qualities are still 9
manifested by its citizens today; and 10
WHEREAS, Throughout Baltimore’s existence, its generous and civic- 11
minded population has enjoyed a wealth of benefits, and those who 12
currently make the village their home can take great pride in their 13
community and its rich heritage. Their efforts have certainly made the 14
area a pleasant and friendly place in which to live and work; and 15
WHEREAS, America is only as strong as her individual communities, 16
which are unique and which make significant contributions to the 17
culture of our state and nation. The Bicentennial of the Village of 18
Baltimore offers its citizens the opportunity to share their memories 19
and experiences and to reflect on the benefits of life in their close- 20
knit community, and they have certainly built on the best traditions 21
of yesterday to ensure a tomorrow filled with hope; therefore be it 22
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the Senate of the 136th General 23
Assembly of Ohio, in adopting this Resolution, commend the Village of 24
Baltimore on its Two Hundred Anniversary and look to its future with 25
