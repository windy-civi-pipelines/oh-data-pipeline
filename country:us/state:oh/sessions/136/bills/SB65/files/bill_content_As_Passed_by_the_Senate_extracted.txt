2025-2026
Senator Lang
Cosponsors: Senators Cirino, DeMora, Hicks-Hudson, Ingram, Johnson, O'Brien,
Patton, Reineke, Reynolds, Roegner, Schaffer, Weinstein
To amend sections 1317.05, 3905.426, 4509.06, and 1
4509.70 and to enact section 1310.251 of the 2
Revised Code to modify the law governing 3
ancillary product protection contracts, vehicle 4
value protection agreements, and uninsured 5
drivers. 6
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF OHIO:
Section 1. That sections 1317.05, 3905.426, 4509.06, and 7
4509.70 be amended and section 1310.251 of the Revised Code be 8
enacted to read as follows: 9
Sec. 1310.251. (A)(1) As used in this section, "excess 10
wear and use waiver" means a contractual agreement that is part 11
of, or a separate addendum to, a lease agreement for use of a 12
motor vehicle, under which the lessor agrees, with or without a 13
separate charge, to do one or both of the following: 14
(a) Cancel or waive all or part of amounts that may become 15
due under a lessee's lease agreement as a result of excess wear 16
and use of a motor vehicle; 17
(b) Cancel or waive amounts due for excess mileage. 18

Sub. S. B. No. 65 Page 2
As Passed by the Senate
(2) "Motor vehicle" has the same meaning as in section 19
4501.01 of the Revised Code and also includes utility vehicles 20
and under-speed vehicles as defined in that section. 21
(B) The terms of a related motor vehicle lease shall not 22
be conditioned upon the consumer's payment for any excess wear 23
and use waiver. Excess wear and use waivers may be discounted or 24
given at no extra charge in connection with the purchase of 25
other noncredit related goods or services. 26
(C) Notwithstanding any provision of the Revised Code to 27
the contrary, an excess wear and use waiver is not an insurance 28
product. 29
Sec. 1317.05. (A) Any retail seller who, in any retail 30
installment contract, has agreed to purchase insurance for the 31
retail buyer and to extend credit for the price thereof, 32
excluding single interest insurance, shall, prior to the due 33
date of the first installment of the retail installment 34
contract, deliver to the retail buyer personally, or mail or 35
cause to be mailed to the retail buyer at the retail buyer's 36
address as shown on the retail installment contract, the policy 37
of insurance, or in lieu thereof a certificate of insurance, or 38
the retail buyer is not liable on the retail buyer's retail 39
installment contract until the policy, or certificate of 40
insurance, is received, or full refund is made of the insurance 41
premium. 42
If the premium for insurance of like kind and amount, as 43
fixed in the published manual of a recognized standard rating 44
bureau designated by the retail seller, is less than the amount 45
charged the retail buyer as fixed in the written instrument in 46
compliance with division (D) of section 1317.04 of the Revised 47
Code, the retail buyer may deduct an amount equal to three times 48

Sub. S. B. No. 65 Page 3
As Passed by the Senate
the difference from the amount owed the retail seller, or the 49
retail seller's successor in interest. Sections 1317.01 to 50
1317.11 of the Revised Code do not impair the authority of the 51
superintendent of insurance to grant, renew, or revoke licenses, 52
nor do said sections authorize anyone other than a licensee of 53
the division of insurance to directly or indirectly receive any 54
part of the amount charged for insurance in connection with any 55
retail installment sale. 56
(B) As used in this division, "debt cancellation or debt 57
suspension product" means a contractual agreement in which a 58
retail seller, or its assignee, agrees for a separate charge to 59
cancel or waive all or a part of amounts due on a retail buyer's 60
retail installment contract in the event of a total physical 61
damage loss or unrecovered theft of the motor vehicle that is 62
the subject of the contract. "Debt cancellation or debt 63
suspension product" includes a guaranteed asset protection 64
waiver, guaranteed auto protection waiver, or other similarly 65
named agreement. A "debt cancellation or debt suspension 66
product" may also provide, with or without a separate charge, a 67
benefit that waives an amount, or provides a borrower with a 68
credit, towards the purchase of a replacement motor vehicle. 69
A debt cancellation or debt suspension product, and an 70
addendum to a retail installment contract containing a debt 71
cancellation or debt suspension product, shall be considered a 72
part of the retail installment contract and shall remain a part 73
of that contract upon the assignment, sale, or transfer of that 74
contract. The charge for any optional debt cancellation or debt 75
suspension product shall be listed as a specific good and shall 76
not be considered a finance charge or interest. The purchase 77
price and the terms of the debt cancellation or debt suspension 78
product shall be disclosed in writing to the buyer. The 79

Sub. S. B. No. 65 Page 4
As Passed by the Senate
extension of credit, terms of the credit, or the terms of the 80
related motor vehicle sale or lease shall not be conditioned on 81
the purchase of the debt cancellation or debt suspension 82
product. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a debt 83
cancellation or debt suspension product shall not be considered 84
insurance. 85
(C) Single interest insurance shall be listed as a 86
specific good in a retail installment contract. 87
(D) As used in this section, "single interest insurance" 88
means insurance that covers only the interest of the holder of 89
the retail installment contract. 90

(1) "Contract holder" means the person who purchased a 92
motor vehicle ancillary product protection contract, any 93
authorized transferee or assignee of the purchaser, or any other 94

ancillary product protection contract. 96
(2) "Finance agreement" means a loan or retail installment 97
contract secured by a motor vehicle or a lease contract for the 98
use of a motor vehicle. 99
(2) (3) "Motor vehicle" has the same meaning as in section 100
4501.01 of the Revised Code and also includes utility vehicles 101
and under-speed vehicles as defined in that section. 102
(3)(a) (4)(a) "Motor vehicle ancillary product protection 103
contract" means a contract or agreement that is effective for a 104
specified duration and paid for by means other than the purchase 105

of insurance, under section 3905.42 of the Revised Code. 282

(H) (L) Unless issued by an insurer authorized or eligible 283
to do business in this state, a contract identified in division 284
(A)(3)(c)(i) (A)(4)(c)(i) or (v) of this section does not 285
constitute a contract substantially amounting to insurance, or 286
the contract's issuance the business of insurance, under section 287
3905.42 of the Revised Code. 288
(I) (M) The rights of a contract holder against a 289
provider's reimbursement insurance policy insurer as provided in 290
this section apply only in regard to a reimbursement insurance 291
policy issued under this section. This section does not create 292
any contractual rights in favor of a person that does not 293
qualify as an insured under any other type of insurance policy 294
described in Title XXXIX of the Revised Code. This section does 295
not prohibit the insurer of a provider's reimbursement insurance 296
policy from assuming liability for contracts issued prior to the 297
effective date of the policy or July 1, 2009. 298
(J) (N) A contract or agreement described in division (A) 299
(3)(a)(iv) of this section in which the provider is a tire 300
manufacturer shall be exempt from the requirements of division 301

Any person who is in any manner involved in a motor vehicle 317
accident within six months of the accident , including as the 318

sustaining bodily injury or property damage, may, within six 320
months after the accident, forward a written report of the 321
accident to the registrar of motor vehicles on a form prescribed 322
by the registrar alleging that a driver or owner of any other 323
vehicle involved in the accident was uninsured at the time of 324
the accident. 325
(B) Upon receipt of the accident report, the registrar 326
shall send a notice by regular mail to the driver and owner 327
alleged to be uninsured requiring the person to give evidence 328
that the person had proof of financial responsibility in effect 329
at the time of the accident. 330

the registrar, the driver of the vehicle alleged to be uninsured 332
shall forward a report together with acceptable proof of 333
financial responsibility to the registrar in a form prescribed 334
by the registrar. The forwarding of the report by the owner of 335
the motor vehicle involved in the accident is deemed compliance 336
with this section by the driver. This section does not change or 337
modify the duties of the driver or operator of a motor vehicle 338
as set forth in section 4549.02 of the Revised Code. 339

among such companies of applicants for such policies and for 345
motor-vehicle liability policies who are in good faith entitled 346
to but are unable to procure such policies through ordinary 347
methods. When any such plan has been approved by the 348
superintendent, all such insurance companies shall subscribe and 349
participate. Any applicant for such policy, any person insured 350
under such plan of operation, and any insurance company 351
affected, may appeal to the superintendent of insurance from any 352
ruling or decision of the manager or committee designated in the 353
plan to operate the assigned risk insurance plan. Any order or 354
act of the superintendent under this section is subject to 355
review as provided in sections 119.01 to 119.13 of the Revised 356
Code, at the instance of any party in interest. 357

obligation to make such filings, as described in section 3937.03 368
of the Revised Code. 369
