(B) The terms of a related motor vehicle lease shall not 25

given at no extra charge in connection with the purchase of 28
other noncredit related goods or services. 29
(C) Notwithstanding any provision of the Revised Code to 30
the contrary, an excess wear and use waiver is not an insurance 31

Sec. 1317.05. (A) Any retail seller who, in any retail 33
installment contract, has agreed to purchase insurance for the 34

contract. The charge for any optional debt cancellation or debt 78
suspension product shall be listed as a specific good and shall 79

price and the terms of the debt cancellation or debt suspension 81

extension of credit, terms of the credit, or the terms of the 83
related motor vehicle sale or lease shall not be conditioned on 84

Code, the clerk shall issue a physical certificate of title to 1073
an applicant unless the applicant specifically requests the 1074

to issue an electronic certificate of title. The fact that a 1076
S. B. No. 65 Page 38

physical certificate of title is not issued for a motor vehicle 1077
does not affect ownership of the vehicle. In that case, when the 1078
clerk completes the process of entering certificate of title 1079
application information into the automated title processing 1080
system, the effect of the completion of the process is the same 1081
as if the clerk actually issued a physical certificate of title 1082
for the motor vehicle. 1083

certificate of title on behalf of a customer who purchases a 1085

requests. The authorization to print the non-negotiable evidence 1088
of ownership shall come from the clerk with whom the dealer 1089
makes application for the certificate of title for the customer, 1090
but the printing by the dealer does not create an agency 1091

a clerk of a court of common pleas for a non-negotiable evidence 1094

shall forward a report together with acceptable proof of 1117
financial responsibility to the registrar in a form prescribed 1118

modify the duties of the driver or operator of a motor vehicle 1122
as set forth in section 4549.02 of the Revised Code. 1123

BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF OHIO:
Section 1. That sections 1317.05, 3905.426, 4501.01, 9
4503.21, 4505.08, 4509.06, 4509.70, 4513.071, 4513.38, and 10
4513.41 be amended and sections 1310.251, 4503.183, 4503.211, 11
and 4505.072 of the Revised Code be enacted to read as follows: 12
Sec. 1310.251. (A)(1) As used in this section, "excess 13
wear and use waiver" means a contractual agreement that is part 14
of, or a separate addendum to, a lease agreement for use of a 15
motor vehicle, under which the lessor agrees, with or without a 16
separate charge, to do one or both of the following: 17
(a) Cancel or waive all or part of amounts that may become 18
due under a lessee's lease agreement as a result of excess wear 19

S. B. No. 65 Page 2
As Introduced
and use of a motor vehicle; 20
(b) Cancel or waive amounts due for excess mileage. 21
(2) "Motor vehicle" has the same meaning as in section 22
4501.01 of the Revised Code and also includes utility vehicles 23
and under-speed vehicles as defined in that section. 24
(B) The terms of a related motor vehicle lease shall not 25
be conditioned upon the consumer's payment for any excess wear 26
and use waiver. Excess wear and use waivers may be discounted or 27
given at no extra charge in connection with the purchase of 28
other noncredit related goods or services. 29
(C) Notwithstanding any provision of the Revised Code to 30
the contrary, an excess wear and use waiver is not an insurance 31
product. 32
Sec. 1317.05. (A) Any retail seller who, in any retail 33
installment contract, has agreed to purchase insurance for the 34
retail buyer and to extend credit for the price thereof, 35
excluding single interest insurance, shall, prior to the due 36
date of the first installment of the retail installment 37
contract, deliver to the retail buyer personally, or mail or 38
cause to be mailed to the retail buyer at the retail buyer's 39
address as shown on the retail installment contract, the policy 40
of insurance, or in lieu thereof a certificate of insurance, or 41
the retail buyer is not liable on the retail buyer's retail 42
installment contract until the policy, or certificate of 43
insurance, is received, or full refund is made of the insurance 44
premium. 45
If the premium for insurance of like kind and amount, as 46
fixed in the published manual of a recognized standard rating 47
bureau designated by the retail seller, is less than the amount 48

S. B. No. 65 Page 3
As Introduced
charged the retail buyer as fixed in the written instrument in 49
compliance with division (D) of section 1317.04 of the Revised 50
Code, the retail buyer may deduct an amount equal to three times 51
the difference from the amount owed the retail seller, or the 52
retail seller's successor in interest. Sections 1317.01 to 53
1317.11 of the Revised Code do not impair the authority of the 54
superintendent of insurance to grant, renew, or revoke licenses, 55
nor do said sections authorize anyone other than a licensee of 56
the division of insurance to directly or indirectly receive any 57
part of the amount charged for insurance in connection with any 58
retail installment sale. 59
(B) As used in this division, "debt cancellation or debt 60
suspension product" means a contractual agreement in which a 61
retail seller, or its assignee, agrees for a separate charge to 62

damage loss or unrecovered theft of the motor vehicle that is 65
the subject of the contract. "Debt cancellation or debt 66
suspension product" includes a guaranteed asset protection 67
waiver, guaranteed auto protection waiver, or other similarly 68
named agreement. A "debt cancellation or debt suspension 69
product" may also provide, with or without a separate charge, a 70
benefit that waives an amount, or provides a borrower with a 71
credit, towards the purchase of a replacement motor vehicle. 72
A debt cancellation or debt suspension product, and an 73
addendum to a retail installment contract containing a debt 74
cancellation or debt suspension product, shall be considered a 75
part of the retail installment contract and shall remain a part 76
of that contract upon the assignment, sale, or transfer of that 77
contract. The charge for any optional debt cancellation or debt 78
suspension product shall be listed as a specific good and shall 79

S. B. No. 65 Page 4
As Introduced
not be considered a finance charge or interest. The purchase 80
price and the terms of the debt cancellation or debt suspension 81
product shall be disclosed in writing to the buyer. The 82
extension of credit, terms of the credit, or the terms of the 83
related motor vehicle sale or lease shall not be conditioned on 84
the purchase of the debt cancellation or debt suspension 85
product. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a debt 86
cancellation or debt suspension product shall not be considered 87
insurance. 88
(C) Single interest insurance shall be listed as a 89
specific good in a retail installment contract. 90
(D) As used in this section, "single interest insurance" 91
means insurance that covers only the interest of the holder of 92
the retail installment contract. 93
