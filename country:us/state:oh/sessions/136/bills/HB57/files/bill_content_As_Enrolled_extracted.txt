time policy adopted under this section. This division does not eliminate, limit, or reduce any other
immunity or defense that a school district, member of a school district board of education, or school
district employee may be entitled to under Chapter 2744. or any other provision of the Revised Code

education and the parent or guardian of the student to whom the drug was administered. The
superintendent of a district described in this section shall annually report the district's use of
overdose reversal drugs in emergency situations to the department of education and workforce.
(E) If the superintendent of a district described in this section determines that a persistent
pattern of overdoses at the district's schools has emerged, the superintendent shall notify the parent
or guardian of each student enrolled in the district.
