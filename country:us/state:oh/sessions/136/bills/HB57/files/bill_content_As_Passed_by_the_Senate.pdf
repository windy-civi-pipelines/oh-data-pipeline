Sub. H. B. No. 57 Page 2
As Passed by the Senate
(B) A school district board of education shall adopt a 15
policy that authorizes a student to be excused from school to 16
attend a released time course in religious instruction for at 17
least one period per week, provided that each of the following 18
applies: 19
(1) The student's parent or guardian gives written 20
consent. 21
(2) The sponsoring entity maintains attendance records and 22
makes them available to the school district the student attends. 23
(3) Transportation to and from the place of instruction, 24
including transportation for students with disabilities, is the 25
complete responsibility of the sponsoring entity, parent, 26
guardian, or student. 27
(4) The sponsoring entity makes provisions for and assumes 28
liability for the student. 29
(5) No public funds are expended and no public school 30
personnel are involved in providing the religious instruction. 31
(6) The student assumes responsibility for any missed 32
schoolwork. 33
While in attendance in a released time course in religious 34
instruction, a student shall not be considered absent from 35
school. No student may be released from a core curriculum 36
subject course to attend a religious instruction course. 37
(C) A school district board of education shall collaborate 38
with a sponsoring entity of a released time course in religious 39
instruction to identify a time to offer the course during the 40
school day. 41
(D) A policy adopted under division (B) of this section 42

Sub. H. B. No. 57 Page 3
As Passed by the Senate
shall not prohibit students from bringing external educational 43
and program materials into school. 44
(E) A Unless otherwise specified in a school district's 45
policy adopted under division (B) of this section, a student 46
shall not exceed be excused from school to attend a released 47
time course in religious instruction for longer than either of 48
the following: 49
(1) For students in an elementary or middle school, two 50
periods in total per week; 51
(2) For students in high school, the amount of time that 52
is equivalent to attending two units of high school credit per 53
week. 54
(F) A policy adopted under division (B) of this section 55
may authorize high school students to earn up to two units of 56
high school credit for the completion of a released time course 57
in religious instruction. In determining whether to award credit 58
for completion of such a course, the board shall evaluate the 59
course based on purely secular criteria that are substantially 60
the same criteria used to evaluate similar nonpublic high school 61
courses for purposes of determining whether to award credit for 62
such courses to a student transferring from a nonpublic high 63
school to a public high school. However, there shall be no 64
criteria requiring that released time courses be completed only 65
at a nonpublic school. The decision to award credit for a 66
released time course of religious instruction shall be neutral 67
to, and shall not involve any test for, religious content or 68
denominational affiliation. 69
For purposes of this division, secular criteria may 70
include, but are not limited to, the following: 71

Sub. H. B. No. 57 Page 4
As Passed by the Senate
(1) The number of hours of classroom instruction time; 72
(2) A review of the course syllabus that reflects course 73
requirements and materials used; 74
(3) The methods of assessment used in the course; 75
(4) The qualifications of the course instructor, which 76
shall be similar to the qualifications of other teachers within 77
the district. 78
Notwithstanding division (C)(8) of section 3313.603 of the 79
Revised Code, high school credit awarded to a student for a 80
released time course in religious instruction may substitute for 81
the same amount of credit in subjects listed in that division. 82
(G) A school district, member of a school district board 83
of education, or school district employee is not liable in 84
damages in a civil action for injury allegedly arising during a 85
student's transportation to or from a place of instruction when 86
private transportation is used under a released time policy 87
adopted under this section. This division does not eliminate, 88
limit, or reduce any other immunity or defense that a school 89
district, member of a school district board of education, or 90
school district employee may be entitled to under Chapter 2744. 91
or any other provision of the Revised Code or under the common 92
law of this state. 93

reversal drug" has the same meaning as in section 4729.01 of the 95

school district that elects under section 3715.50 of the Revised 98

policy to fulfill the requirements of this section. 138
