except as otherwise may be provided in any bylaws or resolutions 93
adopted by the board of directors. The board of directors may 94
pay to that county any amount agreed upon by the board of 95
directors and the board of county commissioners of that county 96

service of its officials as fiscal officer and treasurer of the 98
joint district. 99

commissioners may acquire within its county real property or any 119
estate, interest, or right therein, by appropriation or any 120
other method, for use by a county or joint district in 121
connection with such facilities. Appropriation proceedings shall 122

department, shall assist the board of county commissioners or 130
directors in the performance of their duties under this chapter 131
and sections 3734.52 to 3734.575 of the Revised Code and shall 132
be charged with any other duties and services in relation 133

As Passed by the House
duties and also may employ financial advisers and any other 136
professional services it considers necessary to assist it in the 137
construction, financing, and maintenance of solid waste 138
collection or other solid waste facilities. Such contracts of 139
employment shall not require the certificate provided in section 140

Section 10:
5705.41 of the Revised Code. Payment for such services may be 141
made from the general fund or any other fund legally available 142
for that use at times that are agreed upon or as determined by 143
the board of county commissioners or directors, and the funds 144
may be reimbursed from the proceeds of bonds or notes issued to 145
pay the cost of any improvement to which the services related. 146
(E)(1) The prosecuting attorney of the county shall serve 147
as the legal advisor of a county district and shall provide such 148
services to the board of county commissioners of the district as 149
are required or authorized to be provided to other county boards 150
under Chapter 309. of the Revised Code, except that, if the 151
board considers it to be necessary or appropriate, the board, on 152
its own initiative, may employ an attorney or other legal 153
counsel on an annual basis to serve as the legal advisor of the 154
district in place of the prosecuting attorney. When the 155
prosecuting attorney is serving as the district's legal advisor 156
and the board considers it to be necessary or appropriate, the 157
board, on its own initiative, may employ an attorney or other 158
legal counsel to represent or advise the board regarding a 159
particular matter in place of the prosecuting attorney. The 160
employment of an attorney or other legal counsel on an annual 161
basis or in a particular matter is not subject to or governed by 162

Section 11:
sections 305.14 and 309.09 of the Revised Code. 163
Notwithstanding the employment of an attorney or other 164
legal counsel on an annual basis to serve as the district's 165
legal advisor, the board may require written opinions or 166
Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 7
As Passed by the House
instructions from the prosecuting attorney under section 309.09 167
of the Revised Code in matters connected with its official 168
duties as though the prosecuting attorney were serving as the 169
legal advisor of the district. 170
(2) The board of directors of a joint district may 171
designate the prosecuting attorney of one of the counties 172
forming the district to serve as the legal advisor of the 173
district. When so designated, the prosecuting attorney shall 174
provide such services to the joint district as are required or 175
authorized to be provided to county boards under Chapter 309. of 176
the Revised Code. The board of directors may pay to that county 177
any amount agreed upon by the board of directors and the board 178
of county commissioners of that county to reimburse that county 179
for the cost properly allocable to the services of its 180
prosecuting attorney as the legal advisor of the joint district. 181
When that prosecuting attorney is so serving and the board 182
considers it to be necessary or appropriate, the board, on its 183
own initiative, may employ an attorney or other legal counsel to 184
represent or advise the board regarding a particular matter in 185
place of the prosecuting attorney. 186
Instead of designating the prosecuting attorney of one of 187
the counties forming the district to be the legal advisor of the 188
district, the board of directors may employ on an annual basis 189
an attorney or other legal counsel to serve as the district's 190
legal advisor. Notwithstanding the employment of an attorney or 191
other legal counsel as the district's legal advisor, the board 192
of directors may require written opinions or instructions from 193
the prosecuting attorney of any of the counties forming the 194
district in matters connected with the board's official duties, 195
and the prosecuting attorney shall provide the written opinion 196

division (E)(2) of this section. 199
(F) A board of county commissioners may issue bonds or 200
bond anticipation notes of the county to pay the cost of 201
preparing general and detailed plans and other data required for 202
the construction of solid waste facilities in connection with a 203
county or joint district. A board of directors of a joint solid 204
waste management district may issue bonds or bond anticipation 205
notes of the joint solid waste management district to pay the 206
cost of preparing general and detailed plans and other data 207
required for the construction of solid waste facilities in 208
connection with a joint district. The bonds and notes shall be 209
issued in accordance with Chapter 133. of the Revised Code, 210
except that the maximum maturity of bonds issued for that 211
purpose shall not exceed ten years. Bond anticipation notes may 212
be paid from the proceeds of bonds issued either to pay the cost 213
of the solid waste facilities or to pay the cost of the plans 214
and other data. 215
(G) To the extent authorized by the solid waste management 216
plan of the district approved under section 3734.521 or 3734.55 217
of the Revised Code or subsequent amended plans of the district 218
approved under section 3734.521 or 3734.56 of the Revised Code, 219
the board of county commissioners of a county district or board 220
of directors of a joint district may adopt, publish, and enforce 221
rules doing any of the following: 222
(1) Prohibiting or limiting the receipt of solid wastes 223
generated outside the district or outside a service area 224
prescribed in the solid waste management plan or amended plan, 225
at facilities located within the solid waste management 226

Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 9
As Passed by the House
or amended plan under divisions (A)(6) and (7) of section 228

Section 12:
3734.53 of the Revised Code. However, rules adopted by a board 229
under division (G)(1) of this section may be adopted and 230
enforced with respect to solid waste disposal facilities in the 231
solid waste management district that are not owned by a county 232
or the solid waste management district only if the board submits 233
an application to the director of environmental protection that 234
demonstrates that there is insufficient capacity to dispose of 235
all solid wastes that are generated within the district at the 236
solid waste disposal facilities located within the district and 237
the director approves the application. The demonstration in the 238
application shall be based on projections contained in the plan 239
or amended plan of the district. The director shall establish 240
the form of the application. The approval or disapproval of such 241
an application by the director is an action that is appealable 242
under section 3745.04 of the Revised Code. 243
In addition, the director of environmental protection may 244
issue an order modifying a rule adopted under division (G)(1) of 245
this section to allow the disposal in the district of solid 246
wastes from another county or joint solid waste management 247
district if all of the following apply: 248
(a) The district in which the wastes were generated does 249
not have sufficient capacity to dispose of solid wastes 250
generated within it for six months following the date of the 251
director's order. 252
(b) No new solid waste facilities will begin operation 253
during those six months in the district in which the wastes were 254
generated and, despite good faith efforts to do so, it is 255
impossible to site new solid waste facilities within the 256
district because of its high population density. 257
Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 10
As Passed by the House
(c) The district in which the wastes were generated has 258
made good faith efforts to negotiate with other districts to 259
incorporate its disposal needs within those districts' solid 260
waste management plans, including efforts to develop joint 261
facilities authorized under section 343.02 of the Revised Code, 262
and the efforts have been unsuccessful. 263
(d) The district in which the wastes were generated has 264
located a facility willing to accept the district's solid wastes 265
for disposal within the receiving district. 266
(e) The district in which the wastes were generated has 267
demonstrated to the director that the conditions specified in 268
divisions (G)(1)(a) to (d) of this section have been met. 269
(f) The director finds that the issuance of the order will 270
be consistent with the state solid waste management plan and 271
that receipt of the out-of-district wastes will not limit the 272
capacity of the receiving district to dispose of its in-district 273
wastes to less than eight years. 274
Any order issued under division (G)(1) of this section 275
shall not become final until thirty days after it has been 276
served upon the county or joint solid waste management district 277
that will receive the out-of-district wastes either by certified 278
mail or, if the director has record of an internet identifier of 279
record associated with the district, by ordinary mail and by 280
that internet identifier of record. 281
(2) Governing the maintenance, protection, and use of 282
solid waste collection or other solid waste facilities located 283
within its district. The rules adopted under division (G)(2) of 284
this section shall not establish design standards for solid 285
waste facilities and shall be consistent with the solid waste 286
Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 11
As Passed by the House
provisions of Chapter 3734. of the Revised Code and the rules 287
adopted under those provisions. The rules adopted under division 288
(G)(2) of this section may prohibit any person, municipal 289
corporation, township, or other political subdivision from 290
constructing, enlarging, or modifying any solid waste facility 291
until general plans and specifications for the proposed 292
improvement have been submitted to and approved by the board of 293
county commissioners or board of directors as complying with the 294
solid waste management plan or amended plan of the district. The 295
construction of such a facility shall be done under the 296
supervision of the county sanitary engineer or, in the case of a 297
joint district, a county sanitary engineer designated by the 298
board of directors, and any person, municipal corporation, 299
township, or other political subdivision proposing or 300
constructing such improvements shall pay to the county or joint 301
district all expenses incurred by the board in connection 302
therewith. The sanitary engineer may enter upon any public or 303
private property for the purpose of making surveys or 304
examinations necessary for designing solid waste facilities or 305
for supervising the construction, enlargement, modification, or 306
operation of any such facilities. No person, municipal 307
corporation, township, or other political subdivision shall 308
forbid or interfere with the sanitary engineer or the sanitary 309
engineer's authorized assistants entering upon such property for 310
that purpose. If actual damage is done to property by the making 311
of the surveys and examinations, a board shall pay the 312
reasonable value of that damage to the owner of the property 313
damaged, and the cost shall be included in the financing of the 314
improvement for which the surveys and examinations are made. 315

facilities included in the district's solid waste management 319
plan or amended plan. A board of county commissioners or board 320
of directors or its authorized representative may enter upon the 321
premises of any solid waste facility included in the district's 322
solid waste management plan or amended plan for the purpose of 323
conducting the inspections required or authorized by the rules 324
adopted under division (G)(3) of this section. No person, 325
municipal corporation, township, or other political subdivision 326
shall forbid or interfere with a board of county commissioners 327
or directors or its authorized representative entering upon the 328
premises of any such solid waste facility for that purpose. 329
(4) Exempting the owner or operator of any existing or 330
proposed solid waste facility provided for in the plan or 331
amended plan from compliance with any amendment to a township 332
zoning resolution adopted under section 519.12 of the Revised 333
Code or to a county rural zoning resolution adopted under 334

the parcel or parcels upon which the facility is to be 336
constructed or modified and that became effective within two 337
years prior to the filing of an application for a permit 338
required under division (A)(2)(a) of section 3734.05 of the 339
Revised Code to open a new or modify an existing solid waste 340
facility. 341

may enter into a contract with any person, municipal 343
corporation, township, or other political subdivision for the 344
operation and maintenance of any solid waste facilities 345

implemented under section 3734.521, 3734.55, or 3734.56 of the 386
Revised Code, as applicable, regardless of whether the other 387
facility is located within or outside of the district, if the 388
board finds that delivery of those solid wastes to the other 389
facility is not inconsistent with the projections contained in 390
the district's initial or amended plan under divisions (A)(6) 391
and (7) of section 3734.53 of the Revised Code as approved or 392
ordered to be implemented and will not adversely affect the 393

days after receiving the request. Upon granting such a waiver, 398
the board shall send notice of that fact to the director. The 399
notice shall indicate to whom the waiver was granted. Any waiver 400

Revised Code. 709
(D) The board of trustees of a regional solid waste 710
management authority in a county solid waste management district 711
may designate the prosecuting attorney of the county to serve as 712
the legal advisor of the authority, and the board of trustees of 713
an authority in a joint district may designate the prosecuting 714
attorney of one of the counties forming the district to serve as 715
the legal advisor of the authority. The designated prosecuting 716
attorney shall provide such services to the authority as are 717
required or authorized to be provided to county boards under 718
Chapter 309. of the Revised Code. The board of trustees may pay 719
to the county whose prosecuting attorney is serving as the 720
authority's legal advisor any amount agreed upon by the board of 721
trustees and the board of county commissioners of that county to 722
reimburse that county for the cost properly allocable to the 723
services of its prosecuting attorney as the authority's legal 724
advisor. When a prosecuting attorney is so serving and the board 725
considers it to be necessary or appropriate, the board, on its 726
own initiative, may employ an attorney or other legal counsel to 727
advise the board regarding a particular matter in place of the 728
prosecuting attorney. 729
Instead of designating the prosecuting attorney of the 730
county or of one of the counties forming the district, as 731
appropriate, to be the legal advisor of the regional authority, 732
the board of trustees may employ on an annual basis an attorney 733
or other legal counsel to serve as the authority's legal 734
advisor. Notwithstanding the employment of an attorney or other 735
legal counsel on an annual basis as the authority's legal 736
advisor, the board of trustees may require written opinions or 737
instructions from the prosecuting attorney of the county or, in 738
Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 26
As Passed by the House
the case of a joint district, any of the counties forming the 739
district in matters connected with the board's official duties, 740
and the prosecuting attorney shall provide the written opinion 741
or instructions as though he the prosecuting attorney had been 742
designated to serve as the authority's legal advisor under this 743
division. 744
(E) Within ninety days after October 29, 1993, one member 745
representing industrial, commercial, or institutional generators 746
of solid wastes within the district and one member representing 747
the general interests of citizens who shall have no conflict of 748
interest through affiliation with a waste management company or 749
with any entity that is a significant generator of solid wastes 750
shall be added to the board of trustees of a regional authority 751
formed in a county district. In the case of a regional authority 752
formed in a joint district, one member shall be added to the 753
board of trustees from each county that is a member of the joint 754
district to represent industrial, commercial, or institutional 755
generators of solid wastes within the county, and one member 756
shall be added to the board from each such county to represent 757
the general interests of citizens who shall have no conflict of 758
interest through affiliation with a waste management company or 759
with any entity that is a significant generator of solid wastes. 760
The members representing generators and the general interests of 761
citizens shall be added to the board of trustees without the 762
necessity for amending the agreement to form the regional 763
authority. They shall be appointed in the same manner as the 764
public member of the board is required to be appointed under 765
this section and shall serve for terms of the same length as the 766
other members, as provided in the agreement. 767

(B) The board of county commissioners of a county forming 784
a joint solid waste management district may initiate proceedings 785
to withdraw from the district by adopting a resolution 786
requesting to withdraw. Upon adopting the resolution, the board 787
shall deliver a copy of it to the board of directors of the 788
district. Upon receiving the resolution, the board of directors 789
shall deliver written notice of the proposed withdrawal to the 790
boards of county commissioners of the other counties forming the 791
district. Within sixty days after receiving the notice, the 792
other boards of county commissioners each shall adopt a 793
resolution approving or disapproving the proposed withdrawal and 794
deliver a copy of the resolution to the board of directors. If 795
any of the other boards of county commissioners adopts a 796
resolution of disapproval, the board of directors shall declare 797
the proposed withdrawal to be disapproved and shall deliver 798
written notice of the disapproval to the boards of county 799

As Passed by the House
commissioners of the affected counties. If all of the other 800
boards of county commissioners adopt a resolution approving the 801
proposed withdrawal, the board of directors shall declare the 802
withdrawal to be approved and shall deliver written notice of 803
the approval to the boards of county commissioners of the 804
affected counties. The board of directors shall determine 805
whether the withdrawal has been approved or disapproved and 806
deliver the required written notice of the approval or 807
disapproval to the boards of county commissioners of the 808
affected counties within thirty days after receiving the 809
resolutions of approval or disapproval from those boards. 810
Promptly after the approval of the withdrawal, proceedings shall 811
be initiated in accordance with division (E) of section 3734.521 812
of the Revised Code to effect the withdrawal. 813
A withdrawal becomes final on the first day of January 814

district composition that involves the withdrawal. On and after 818
that first day of January, the withdrawing county ceases to be a 819
part of the joint district, its members on the board of 820
directors shall cease to be members of the board, and its power 821
to levy a tax upon taxable property to support the district 822
terminates, except that the county shall continue to levy and 823
collect any taxes levied for the payment of indebtedness of the 824
district as it was composed at the time the indebtedness was 825
incurred. Upon the withdrawal of a county from a joint district, 826
the board of directors shall ascertain, apportion, and order a 827
division of the funds on hand, credits, and real and personal 828
property of the district, either in money or in kind, on any 829
equitable basis between the district and the withdrawing county 830

district entered into and ratified under division (A) of section 832

Section 37:
343.01 of the Revised Code and the prior contributions of the 833

If the withdrawal of one or more counties would leave only 835
one county participating in a joint district, the board of 836
directors shall ascertain, apportion, and order a final division 837
of the funds on hand, credits, and real and personal property of 838
the district. On and after the first day of January on which the 839
latest withdrawal of a county from the district becomes final, 840
the district shall be dissolved. When a joint district is 841
dissolved and any indebtedness remains unpaid, the boards of 842
county commissioners shall continue to levy and collect taxes 843
for the payment of the indebtedness in support of the joint 844
district in the amounts established by the agreement at the time 845
the indebtedness was incurred. 846
For the purposes of this division, "counties forming the 847

of capacity under division (E)(1) or (2) of this section fails 1922
to obtain approval of its plan or amended plan within thirty- 1923
eight months after the submission of its preliminary 1924
demonstration of capacity, the director shall determine what 1925
actions are necessary to ensure that each county involved in the 1926

have within its boundaries sufficient solid waste management 1928
facility capacity to provide for the disposal of all of the 1929
solid wastes generated within its boundaries during the 1930
subsequent ten-year period or will have access to sufficient 1931
capacity at facilities located outside the district or this 1932
state by contract or agreement to dispose of all of the solid 1933
wastes generated within the district during that ten-year 1934
period. Based upon that determination, the director shall do 1935
either of the following, as appropriate: 1936
(1) If the director determines that the solid waste 1937
management needs of each of the counties involved can be met if 1938

which the plan or amended plan was prepared to implement it in 1953
compliance with the implementation schedule contained in it. 1954
(2) If the director determines that the solid waste 1955
management needs of each of the counties involved cannot be met 1956
if the proposed change in district composition were to occur, he 1957
shall make a determination as to how county or joint districts 1958
should be formed from among those counties to ensure that each 1959
will be included in a district that either will have within its 1960
boundaries sufficient solid waste management facility capacity 1961
to provide for the disposal of all the solid wastes generated 1962
within the district during the subsequent ten-year period or 1963
will have access to sufficient capacity at facilities located 1964
outside the district or this state by contract or agreement to 1965
dispose of all the solid wastes generated within the district 1966
during that ten-year period. After making his determination, the 1967
director shall prepare an initial or amended solid waste 1968

In the case of solid wastes that are taken to a solid 2728
waste transfer facility located in this state prior to being 2729
transported for disposal at a solid waste disposal facility 2730
located in this state or outside of this state, the fees levied 2731
under this division shall be collected by the owner or operator 2732
of the transfer facility as a trustee for the state. The amount 2733
of fees required to be collected under this division at such a 2734
transfer facility shall equal the total tonnage of solid wastes 2735
received at the facility multiplied by the fees levied under 2736
this division. In the case of solid wastes that are not taken to 2737
a solid waste transfer facility located in this state prior to 2738
being transported to a solid waste disposal facility, the fees 2739
shall be collected by the owner or operator of the solid waste 2740
disposal facility as a trustee for the state. The amount of fees 2741
required to be collected under this division at such a disposal 2742
facility shall equal the total tonnage of solid wastes received 2743
at the facility that was not previously taken to a solid waste 2744
transfer facility located in this state multiplied by the fees 2745
levied under this division. Fees levied under this division do 2746
not apply to materials separated from a mixed waste stream for 2747
recycling by a generator or materials removed from the solid 2748
waste stream through recycling, as "recycling" is defined in 2749
rules adopted under section 3734.02 of the Revised Code. 2750
The owner or operator of a solid waste transfer facility 2751
or disposal facility, as applicable, shall prepare and file with 2752
the director of environmental protection each month a return 2753
indicating the total tonnage of solid wastes received at the 2754
facility during that month and the total amount of the fees 2755
required to be collected under this division during that month. 2756
In addition, the owner or operator of a solid waste disposal 2757
facility shall indicate on the return the total tonnage of solid 2758
Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 93
As Passed by the House
wastes received from transfer facilities located in this state 2759
during that month for which the fees were required to be 2760
collected by the transfer facilities. The monthly returns shall 2761
be filed on a form prescribed by the director. Not later than 2762
thirty days after the last day of the month to which a return 2763
applies, the owner or operator shall mail to the director the 2764
return for that month together with the fees required to be 2765
collected under this division during that month as indicated on 2766
the return or may submit the return and fees electronically in a 2767
manner approved by the director. If the return is filed and the 2768
amount of the fees due is paid in a timely manner as required in 2769
this division, the owner or operator may retain a discount of 2770
three-fourths of one per cent of the total amount of the fees 2771
that are required to be paid as indicated on the return. 2772
The owner or operator may request an extension of not more 2773
than thirty days for filing the return and remitting the fees, 2774
provided that the owner or operator has submitted such a request 2775
in writing to the director together with a detailed description 2776
of why the extension is requested, the director has received the 2777
request not later than the day on which the return is required 2778
to be filed, and the director has approved the request. If the 2779
fees are not remitted within thirty days after the last day of 2780
the month to which the return applies or are not remitted by the 2781
last day of an extension approved by the director, the owner or 2782
operator shall not retain the three-fourths of one per cent 2783
discount and shall pay an additional ten per cent of the amount 2784
of the fees for each month that they are late. For purposes of 2785
calculating the late fee, the first month in which fees are late 2786
begins on the first day after the deadline has passed for timely 2787
submitting the return and fees, and one additional month shall 2788
be counted every thirty days thereafter. 2789

As Passed by the House
The owner or operator of a solid waste facility may 2790
request a refund or credit of fees levied under this division 2791
and remitted to the director that have not been paid to the 2792
owner or operator. Such a request shall be made only if the fees 2793
have not been collected by the owner or operator, have become a 2794
debt that has become worthless or uncollectable for a period of 2795
six months or more, and may be claimed as a deduction, including 2796
a deduction claimed if the owner or operator keeps accounts on 2797
an accrual basis, under the "Internal Revenue Code of 1954," 68A 2798
Stat. 50, 26 U.S.C. 166, as amended, and regulations adopted 2799
under it. Prior to making a request for a refund or credit, an 2800
owner or operator shall make reasonable efforts to collect the 2801
applicable fees. A request for a refund or credit shall not 2802
include any costs resulting from those efforts to collect unpaid 2803
fees. 2804
A request for a refund or credit of fees shall be made in 2805
writing, on a form prescribed by the director, and shall be 2806
supported by evidence that may be required in rules adopted by 2807
the director under this chapter. After reviewing the request, 2808
and if the request and evidence submitted with the request 2809
indicate that a refund or credit is warranted, the director 2810
shall grant a refund to the owner or operator or shall permit a 2811
credit to be taken by the owner or operator on a subsequent 2812
monthly return submitted by the owner or operator. The amount of 2813
a refund or credit shall not exceed an amount that is equal to 2814
ninety days' worth of fees owed to an owner or operator by a 2815
particular debtor of the owner or operator. A refund or credit 2816
shall not be granted by the director to an owner or operator 2817
more than once in any twelve-month period for fees owed to the 2818
owner or operator by a particular debtor. 2819
If, after receiving a refund or credit from the director, 2820
Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 95
As Passed by the House
an owner or operator receives payment of all or part of the 2821
fees, the owner or operator shall remit the fees with the next 2822
monthly return submitted to the director together with a written 2823
explanation of the reason for the submittal. 2824
For purposes of computing the fees levied under this 2825
division or division (B) of this section, any solid waste 2826
transfer or disposal facility that does not use scales as a 2827
means of determining gate receipts shall use a conversion factor 2828
of three cubic yards per ton of solid waste or one cubic yard 2829
per ton for baled waste, as applicable. 2830
The fees levied under this division and divisions (B) and 2831
(C) of this section are in addition to all other applicable fees 2832
and taxes and shall be paid by the customer or a political 2833
subdivision to the owner or operator of a solid waste transfer 2834
or disposal facility. In the alternative, the fees shall be paid 2835
by a customer or political subdivision to a transporter of waste 2836
who subsequently transfers the fees to the owner or operator of 2837
such a facility. The fees shall be paid notwithstanding the 2838
existence of any provision in a contract that the customer or a 2839
political subdivision may have with the owner or operator or 2840
with a transporter of waste to the facility that would not 2841
require or allow such payment regardless of whether the contract 2842
was entered prior to or after October 16, 2009. For those 2843
purposes, "customer" means a person who contracts with, or 2844
utilizes the solid waste services of, the owner or operator of a 2845
solid waste transfer or disposal facility or a transporter of 2846
solid waste to such a facility. 2847
(B) For the purposes specified in division (G) of this 2848

under this division, as appropriate, shall establish the rates 2864
of the fees levied under divisions (B)(1), (2), and (3) of this 2865

Section 117:
section, if any, and shall specify whether the fees are levied 2866
on the basis of tons or cubic yards as the unit of measurement. 2867
A solid waste management district that levies fees under this 2868
division on the basis of cubic yards shall do so in accordance 2869
with division (A) of this section. 2870
The fee levied under division (B)(1) of this section shall 2871
be not less than one dollar per ton nor more than two dollars 2872
per ton, the fee levied under division (B)(2) of this section 2873

As Passed by the House
solid waste management policy committee of a district may levy 2880
fees under this division by adopting a resolution establishing 2881
the proposed amount of the fees. Upon adopting the resolution, 2882
the committee shall deliver a copy of the resolution to the 2883
board of county commissioners of each county forming the 2884
district and to the legislative authority of each municipal 2885
corporation and township under the jurisdiction of the district 2886
and shall prepare and publish the resolution and a notice of the 2887
time and location where a public hearing on the fees will be 2888
held. Upon adopting the resolution, the committee shall deliver 2889
written notice of the adoption of the resolution; of the amount 2890
of the proposed fees; and of the date, time, and location of the 2891
public hearing to the director and to the fifty industrial, 2892
commercial, or institutional generators of solid wastes within 2893
the district that generate the largest quantities of solid 2894
wastes, as determined by the committee, and to their local trade 2895
associations. The committee shall make good faith efforts to 2896
identify those generators within the district and their local 2897
trade associations, but the nonprovision of notice under this 2898
division to a particular generator or local trade association 2899
does not invalidate the proceedings under this division. The 2900
publication shall occur at least thirty days before the hearing. 2901
After the hearing, the committee may make such revisions to the 2902
proposed fees as it considers appropriate and thereafter, by 2903
resolution, shall adopt the revised fee schedule. Upon adopting 2904
the revised fee schedule, the committee shall deliver a copy of 2905
the resolution doing so to the board of county commissioners of 2906
each county forming the district and to the legislative 2907
authority of each municipal corporation and township under the 2908
jurisdiction of the district. Within sixty days after the 2909
delivery of a copy of the resolution adopting the proposed 2910
revised fees by the policy committee, each such board and 2911
Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 98
As Passed by the House
legislative authority, by ordinance or resolution, shall approve 2912
or disapprove the revised fees and deliver a copy of the 2913
ordinance or resolution to the committee. If any such board or 2914
legislative authority fails to adopt and deliver to the policy 2915
committee an ordinance or resolution approving or disapproving 2916
the revised fees within sixty days after the policy committee 2917
delivered its resolution adopting the proposed revised fees, it 2918
shall be conclusively presumed that the board or legislative 2919
authority has approved the proposed revised fees. The committee 2920
shall determine if the resolution has been ratified in the same 2921
manner in which it determines if a draft solid waste management 2922
plan has been ratified under division (B) of section 3734.55 of 2923
the Revised Code. 2924
The committee may amend the schedule of fees levied 2925
pursuant to a resolution adopted and ratified under this 2926
division by adopting a resolution establishing the proposed 2927
amount of the amended fees. The committee may repeal the fees 2928
levied pursuant to such a resolution by adopting a resolution 2929
proposing to repeal them. Upon adopting such a resolution, the 2930
committee shall proceed to obtain ratification of the resolution 2931

Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 2
As Passed by the House
commissioners of each county shall do one of the following: 17
(1) Establish, by resolution, and maintain a county solid 18
waste management district under this chapter that consists of 19
all the incorporated and unincorporated territory within the 20
county except as otherwise provided in division (A) of this 21
section; 22
(2) With the boards of county commissioners of one or more 23
other counties establish, by agreement, and maintain a joint 24
solid waste management district under this chapter that consists 25
of all the incorporated and unincorporated territory within the 26
counties forming the joint district except as otherwise provided 27
in division (A) of this section. 28
If a municipal corporation is located in more than one 29
solid waste management district, the entire municipal 30
corporation shall be considered to be included in and shall be 31
under the jurisdiction of the district in which a majority of 32
the population of the municipal corporation resides. 33
A county and joint district established to comply with 34
division (B) of section 3734.52 of the Revised Code shall have a 35
population of not less than one hundred twenty thousand unless, 36
in the instance of a county district, the board of county 37
commissioners has obtained an exemption from that requirement 38
under division (C)(1) or (2) of that section. Each joint 39
district established to comply with an order issued under 40
division (D) of that section shall have a population of at least 41
one hundred twenty thousand. 42
(B) The boards of county commissioners of the counties 43

county with a form of legislative authority other than a board 46
of county commissioners participates, it shall be represented on 47
the board of directors by three persons appointed by the 48
legislative authority. 49
The agreement to establish and maintain a joint district 50
shall be ratified by resolution of the board of county 51
commissioners of each participating county. Upon ratification, 52
the board of directors shall take control of and manage the 53
joint district subject to this chapter, except that, in the case 54
of a joint district formed pursuant to division (C)(B), (D)(C), 55
or (E) (D) of section 343.012 of the Revised Code, the board of 56
directors shall take control of and manage the district when the 57
formation of the district becomes final under the applicable 58
division. A majority of the board of directors constitutes a 59
quorum, and a majority vote is required for the board to act. 60
A county participating in a joint district may contribute 61
lands or rights or interests therein, money, other personal 62
property or rights or interests therein, or services to the 63
district. The agreement shall specify any contributions of 64
participating counties and the rights of the participating 65
counties in lands or personal property, or rights or interests 66
therein, contributed to or otherwise acquired by the joint 67
district. The agreement may be amended or added to by a majority 68
vote of the board of directors, but no amendment or addition 69

lands or personal property without its consent. 71
The board of directors may appoint and fix the 72
compensation of employees of, accept gifts, devises, and 73
bequests for, and take other actions necessary to control and 74
manage the joint district. Employees of the district shall be 75

As Passed by the House
considered county employees for the purposes of Chapter 124. of 76
the Revised Code and other provisions of state law applicable to 77
employees. Instead of or in addition to appointing employees of 78
the district, the board of directors may agree to use employees 79
of one or more of the participating counties in the service of 80
the joint district and to share in their compensation in any 81
manner that may be agreed upon. 82
The board of directors shall do one of the following: 83
(1) Designate the county auditor, including any other 84
official acting in a capacity similar to a county auditor under 85
a county charter, of a county participating in the joint 86
district as the fiscal officer of the district, and the county 87
treasurer, or other official acting in a capacity similar to a 88
county treasurer under a county charter, of that county as the 89
treasurer of the district. The designated county officials shall 90
perform any applicable duties for the district as each typically 91
performs for the county of which the individual is an official, 92
except as otherwise may be provided in any bylaws or resolutions 93
adopted by the board of directors. The board of directors may 94
pay to that county any amount agreed upon by the board of 95
directors and the board of county commissioners of that county 96
to reimburse that county for the cost properly allocable to the 97
service of its officials as fiscal officer and treasurer of the 98
joint district. 99
(2) Appoint one individual who is neither a county auditor 100
nor a county treasurer, and who may be an employee of the 101
district, to serve as both the treasurer of the district and its 102
fiscal officer. That individual shall act as custodian of the 103
funds of the board and the district and shall maintain all 104
accounts of the district. Any reference in this chapter or 105

Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 5
As Passed by the House
Chapter 3734. of the Revised Code to a county auditor or county 106
treasurer serving as fiscal officer of a district or custodian 107
of any funds of a board or district is deemed to refer to an 108
individual appointed under division (B)(2) of this section. 109
The fiscal officer of a district shall establish a general 110
fund and any other necessary funds for the district. 111
(C) A board of county commissioners of a county district 112
or board of directors of a joint district may acquire, by 113
purchase or lease, construct, improve, enlarge, replace, 114
maintain, and operate such solid waste collection systems within 115
their respective districts and such solid waste facilities 116
within or outside their respective districts as are necessary 117
for the protection of the public health. A board of county 118
commissioners may acquire within its county real property or any 119
estate, interest, or right therein, by appropriation or any 120
other method, for use by a county or joint district in 121
connection with such facilities. Appropriation proceedings shall 122
be conducted in accordance with sections 163.01 to 163.22 of the 123
Revised Code. 124
(D) The sanitary engineer or sanitary engineering 125
department of a county maintaining a district and any sanitary 126
engineer or sanitary engineering department of a county in a 127
joint district, as determined by the board of directors, in 128
addition to other duties assigned to that engineer or 129
department, shall assist the board of county commissioners or 130
directors in the performance of their duties under this chapter 131
and sections 3734.52 to 3734.575 of the Revised Code and shall 132
be charged with any other duties and services in relation 133
thereto that the board prescribes. A board may employ registered 134
professional engineers to assist the sanitary engineer in those 135

Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 6
As Passed by the House
duties and also may employ financial advisers and any other 136
professional services it considers necessary to assist it in the 137
construction, financing, and maintenance of solid waste 138
collection or other solid waste facilities. Such contracts of 139
employment shall not require the certificate provided in section 140
5705.41 of the Revised Code. Payment for such services may be 141
made from the general fund or any other fund legally available 142
for that use at times that are agreed upon or as determined by 143
the board of county commissioners or directors, and the funds 144
may be reimbursed from the proceeds of bonds or notes issued to 145
pay the cost of any improvement to which the services related. 146
(E)(1) The prosecuting attorney of the county shall serve 147
as the legal advisor of a county district and shall provide such 148
services to the board of county commissioners of the district as 149
are required or authorized to be provided to other county boards 150
under Chapter 309. of the Revised Code, except that, if the 151
board considers it to be necessary or appropriate, the board, on 152
its own initiative, may employ an attorney or other legal 153
counsel on an annual basis to serve as the legal advisor of the 154
district in place of the prosecuting attorney. When the 155
prosecuting attorney is serving as the district's legal advisor 156
and the board considers it to be necessary or appropriate, the 157
board, on its own initiative, may employ an attorney or other 158
legal counsel to represent or advise the board regarding a 159
particular matter in place of the prosecuting attorney. The 160
employment of an attorney or other legal counsel on an annual 161
basis or in a particular matter is not subject to or governed by 162
sections 305.14 and 309.09 of the Revised Code. 163
Notwithstanding the employment of an attorney or other 164
legal counsel on an annual basis to serve as the district's 165
legal advisor, the board may require written opinions or 166

Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 7
As Passed by the House
instructions from the prosecuting attorney under section 309.09 167
of the Revised Code in matters connected with its official 168
duties as though the prosecuting attorney were serving as the 169
legal advisor of the district. 170
(2) The board of directors of a joint district may 171
designate the prosecuting attorney of one of the counties 172
forming the district to serve as the legal advisor of the 173
district. When so designated, the prosecuting attorney shall 174
provide such services to the joint district as are required or 175
authorized to be provided to county boards under Chapter 309. of 176
the Revised Code. The board of directors may pay to that county 177
any amount agreed upon by the board of directors and the board 178
of county commissioners of that county to reimburse that county 179
for the cost properly allocable to the services of its 180
prosecuting attorney as the legal advisor of the joint district. 181
When that prosecuting attorney is so serving and the board 182
considers it to be necessary or appropriate, the board, on its 183
own initiative, may employ an attorney or other legal counsel to 184
represent or advise the board regarding a particular matter in 185
place of the prosecuting attorney. 186
Instead of designating the prosecuting attorney of one of 187
the counties forming the district to be the legal advisor of the 188
district, the board of directors may employ on an annual basis 189
an attorney or other legal counsel to serve as the district's 190
legal advisor. Notwithstanding the employment of an attorney or 191
other legal counsel as the district's legal advisor, the board 192
of directors may require written opinions or instructions from 193
the prosecuting attorney of any of the counties forming the 194
district in matters connected with the board's official duties, 195
and the prosecuting attorney shall provide the written opinion 196
or instructions as though the prosecuting attorney had been 197

designated to serve as the district's legal advisor under 198
division (E)(2) of this section. 199
(F) A board of county commissioners may issue bonds or 200
bond anticipation notes of the county to pay the cost of 201
preparing general and detailed plans and other data required for 202
the construction of solid waste facilities in connection with a 203
county or joint district. A board of directors of a joint solid 204
waste management district may issue bonds or bond anticipation 205
notes of the joint solid waste management district to pay the 206
cost of preparing general and detailed plans and other data 207
required for the construction of solid waste facilities in 208
connection with a joint district. The bonds and notes shall be 209
issued in accordance with Chapter 133. of the Revised Code, 210
except that the maximum maturity of bonds issued for that 211
purpose shall not exceed ten years. Bond anticipation notes may 212
be paid from the proceeds of bonds issued either to pay the cost 213
of the solid waste facilities or to pay the cost of the plans 214
and other data. 215
(G) To the extent authorized by the solid waste management 216
plan of the district approved under section 3734.521 or 3734.55 217
of the Revised Code or subsequent amended plans of the district 218
approved under section 3734.521 or 3734.56 of the Revised Code, 219
the board of county commissioners of a county district or board 220
of directors of a joint district may adopt, publish, and enforce 221
rules doing any of the following: 222
(1) Prohibiting or limiting the receipt of solid wastes 223
generated outside the district or outside a service area 224
prescribed in the solid waste management plan or amended plan, 225
at facilities located within the solid waste management 226
district, consistent with the projections contained in the plan 227

Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 9
As Passed by the House
or amended plan under divisions (A)(6) and (7) of section 228
3734.53 of the Revised Code. However, rules adopted by a board 229
under division (G)(1) of this section may be adopted and 230
enforced with respect to solid waste disposal facilities in the 231
solid waste management district that are not owned by a county 232
or the solid waste management district only if the board submits 233
an application to the director of environmental protection that 234
demonstrates that there is insufficient capacity to dispose of 235
all solid wastes that are generated within the district at the 236
solid waste disposal facilities located within the district and 237
the director approves the application. The demonstration in the 238
application shall be based on projections contained in the plan 239
or amended plan of the district. The director shall establish 240
the form of the application. The approval or disapproval of such 241
an application by the director is an action that is appealable 242
under section 3745.04 of the Revised Code. 243
In addition, the director of environmental protection may 244
issue an order modifying a rule adopted under division (G)(1) of 245
this section to allow the disposal in the district of solid 246
wastes from another county or joint solid waste management 247
district if all of the following apply: 248
(a) The district in which the wastes were generated does 249
not have sufficient capacity to dispose of solid wastes 250
generated within it for six months following the date of the 251
director's order. 252
(b) No new solid waste facilities will begin operation 253
during those six months in the district in which the wastes were 254
generated and, despite good faith efforts to do so, it is 255
impossible to site new solid waste facilities within the 256
district because of its high population density. 257

Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 10
As Passed by the House
(c) The district in which the wastes were generated has 258
made good faith efforts to negotiate with other districts to 259
incorporate its disposal needs within those districts' solid 260
waste management plans, including efforts to develop joint 261
facilities authorized under section 343.02 of the Revised Code, 262
and the efforts have been unsuccessful. 263
(d) The district in which the wastes were generated has 264
located a facility willing to accept the district's solid wastes 265
for disposal within the receiving district. 266
(e) The district in which the wastes were generated has 267
demonstrated to the director that the conditions specified in 268
divisions (G)(1)(a) to (d) of this section have been met. 269
(f) The director finds that the issuance of the order will 270
be consistent with the state solid waste management plan and 271
that receipt of the out-of-district wastes will not limit the 272
capacity of the receiving district to dispose of its in-district 273
wastes to less than eight years. 274
Any order issued under division (G)(1) of this section 275
shall not become final until thirty days after it has been 276
served upon the county or joint solid waste management district 277
that will receive the out-of-district wastes either by certified 278
mail or, if the director has record of an internet identifier of 279
record associated with the district, by ordinary mail and by 280
that internet identifier of record. 281
(2) Governing the maintenance, protection, and use of 282
solid waste collection or other solid waste facilities located 283
within its district. The rules adopted under division (G)(2) of 284
this section shall not establish design standards for solid 285
waste facilities and shall be consistent with the solid waste 286

Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 11
As Passed by the House
provisions of Chapter 3734. of the Revised Code and the rules 287
adopted under those provisions. The rules adopted under division 288
(G)(2) of this section may prohibit any person, municipal 289
corporation, township, or other political subdivision from 290
constructing, enlarging, or modifying any solid waste facility 291
until general plans and specifications for the proposed 292
improvement have been submitted to and approved by the board of 293
county commissioners or board of directors as complying with the 294
solid waste management plan or amended plan of the district. The 295
construction of such a facility shall be done under the 296
supervision of the county sanitary engineer or, in the case of a 297
joint district, a county sanitary engineer designated by the 298
board of directors, and any person, municipal corporation, 299
township, or other political subdivision proposing or 300
constructing such improvements shall pay to the county or joint 301
district all expenses incurred by the board in connection 302
therewith. The sanitary engineer may enter upon any public or 303
private property for the purpose of making surveys or 304
examinations necessary for designing solid waste facilities or 305
for supervising the construction, enlargement, modification, or 306
operation of any such facilities. No person, municipal 307
corporation, township, or other political subdivision shall 308
forbid or interfere with the sanitary engineer or the sanitary 309
engineer's authorized assistants entering upon such property for 310
that purpose. If actual damage is done to property by the making 311
of the surveys and examinations, a board shall pay the 312
reasonable value of that damage to the owner of the property 313
damaged, and the cost shall be included in the financing of the 314
improvement for which the surveys and examinations are made. 315
(3) Governing the development and implementation of a 316
program for the inspection of solid wastes generated outside the 317

Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 12
As Passed by the House
boundaries of this state that are disposed of at solid waste 318
facilities included in the district's solid waste management 319
plan or amended plan. A board of county commissioners or board 320
of directors or its authorized representative may enter upon the 321
premises of any solid waste facility included in the district's 322
solid waste management plan or amended plan for the purpose of 323
conducting the inspections required or authorized by the rules 324
adopted under division (G)(3) of this section. No person, 325
municipal corporation, township, or other political subdivision 326
shall forbid or interfere with a board of county commissioners 327
or directors or its authorized representative entering upon the 328
premises of any such solid waste facility for that purpose. 329
(4) Exempting the owner or operator of any existing or 330
proposed solid waste facility provided for in the plan or 331
amended plan from compliance with any amendment to a township 332
zoning resolution adopted under section 519.12 of the Revised 333
Code or to a county rural zoning resolution adopted under 334
section 303.12 of the Revised Code that rezoned or redistricted 335
the parcel or parcels upon which the facility is to be 336
constructed or modified and that became effective within two 337
years prior to the filing of an application for a permit 338
required under division (A)(2)(a) of section 3734.05 of the 339
Revised Code to open a new or modify an existing solid waste 340
facility. 341
(H) A board of county commissioners or board of directors 342
may enter into a contract with any person, municipal 343
corporation, township, or other political subdivision for the 344
operation and maintenance of any solid waste facilities 345
regardless of whether the facilities are owned or leased by the 346
county or joint district or the contractor. 347

As Passed by the House
(I)(1) No person, municipal corporation, township, or 348
other political subdivision shall tamper with or damage any 349
solid waste facility constructed under this chapter or any 350
apparatus or accessory connected therewith or pertaining 351
thereto, fail or refuse to comply with the applicable rules 352
adopted by a board of county commissioners or directors under 353
division (G)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section, refuse to 354
permit an inspection or examination by a sanitary engineer as 355

343.014, or 343.015 of the Revised Code, or the director has 364
established facility designations in the initial or amended plan 365
of the district prepared and ordered to be implemented under 366
section 3734.521, 3734.55, or 3734.56 of the Revised Code, no 367
person, municipal corporation, township, or other political 368
subdivision shall deliver, or cause the delivery of, any solid 369
wastes generated within a county or joint district to any solid 370
waste facility other than the facility designated under section 371
343.013, 343.014, or 343.015 of the Revised Code, or in the 372
initial or amended plan of the district prepared and ordered to 373
be implemented under section 3734.521, 3734.55, or 3734.56 of 374
the Revised Code, as applicable, except that source separated 375
recyclable materials may be taken to any legitimate recycling 376
facility. Upon the request of a person or the legislative 377
authority of a municipal corporation or township, the board of 378

county commissioners of a county district or board of directors 379
of a joint district may grant a waiver authorizing the delivery 380
of all or any portion of the solid wastes generated in a 381
municipal corporation or township to a solid waste facility 382
other than the facility designated under section 343.013, 383
343.014, or 343.015 of the Revised Code, or in the initial or 384
amended plan of the district prepared and ordered to be 385
implemented under section 3734.521, 3734.55, or 3734.56 of the 386
Revised Code, as applicable, regardless of whether the other 387
facility is located within or outside of the district, if the 388
board finds that delivery of those solid wastes to the other 389
facility is not inconsistent with the projections contained in 390
the district's initial or amended plan under divisions (A)(6) 391
and (7) of section 3734.53 of the Revised Code as approved or 392
ordered to be implemented and will not adversely affect the 393
implementation and financing of the district's initial or 394
amended plan pursuant to the implementation schedule contained 395
in it under divisions (A)(12)(a) to (d) of that section. The 396
board shall act on a request for such a waiver within ninety 397
days after receiving the request. Upon granting such a waiver, 398
the board shall send notice of that fact to the director. The 399
notice shall indicate to whom the waiver was granted. Any waiver 400
or authorization granted by a board on or before October 29, 401
1993, shall continue in force until the board takes action 402

Revised Code. 709
(D) The board of trustees of a regional solid waste 710
management authority in a county solid waste management district 711
may designate the prosecuting attorney of the county to serve as 712
the legal advisor of the authority, and the board of trustees of 713
an authority in a joint district may designate the prosecuting 714
attorney of one of the counties forming the district to serve as 715
the legal advisor of the authority. The designated prosecuting 716
attorney shall provide such services to the authority as are 717
required or authorized to be provided to county boards under 718
Chapter 309. of the Revised Code. The board of trustees may pay 719
to the county whose prosecuting attorney is serving as the 720

trustees and the board of county commissioners of that county to 722
reimburse that county for the cost properly allocable to the 723
services of its prosecuting attorney as the authority's legal 724
advisor. When a prosecuting attorney is so serving and the board 725
considers it to be necessary or appropriate, the board, on its 726
own initiative, may employ an attorney or other legal counsel to 727
advise the board regarding a particular matter in place of the 728
prosecuting attorney. 729
Instead of designating the prosecuting attorney of the 730
county or of one of the counties forming the district, as 731
appropriate, to be the legal advisor of the regional authority, 732
the board of trustees may employ on an annual basis an attorney 733

advisor. Notwithstanding the employment of an attorney or other 735
legal counsel on an annual basis as the authority's legal 736
advisor, the board of trustees may require written opinions or 737
instructions from the prosecuting attorney of the county or, in 738

Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 26
As Passed by the House
the case of a joint district, any of the counties forming the 739
district in matters connected with the board's official duties, 740
and the prosecuting attorney shall provide the written opinion 741
or instructions as though he the prosecuting attorney had been 742
designated to serve as the authority's legal advisor under this 743
division. 744
(E) Within ninety days after October 29, 1993, one member 745
representing industrial, commercial, or institutional generators 746
of solid wastes within the district and one member representing 747
the general interests of citizens who shall have no conflict of 748
interest through affiliation with a waste management company or 749
with any entity that is a significant generator of solid wastes 750
shall be added to the board of trustees of a regional authority 751
formed in a county district. In the case of a regional authority 752
formed in a joint district, one member shall be added to the 753
board of trustees from each county that is a member of the joint 754
district to represent industrial, commercial, or institutional 755
generators of solid wastes within the county, and one member 756
shall be added to the board from each such county to represent 757
the general interests of citizens who shall have no conflict of 758
interest through affiliation with a waste management company or 759
with any entity that is a significant generator of solid wastes. 760
The members representing generators and the general interests of 761
citizens shall be added to the board of trustees without the 762
necessity for amending the agreement to form the regional 763
authority. They shall be appointed in the same manner as the 764
public member of the board is required to be appointed under 765
this section and shall serve for terms of the same length as the 766
other members, as provided in the agreement. 767

deliver a copy of the resolution to the board of directors. If 795
any of the other boards of county commissioners adopts a 796
resolution of disapproval, the board of directors shall declare 797
the proposed withdrawal to be disapproved and shall deliver 798
written notice of the disapproval to the boards of county 799

commissioners of the affected counties. If all of the other 800
boards of county commissioners adopt a resolution approving the 801
proposed withdrawal, the board of directors shall declare the 802
withdrawal to be approved and shall deliver written notice of 803
the approval to the boards of county commissioners of the 804
affected counties. The board of directors shall determine 805
whether the withdrawal has been approved or disapproved and 806
deliver the required written notice of the approval or 807

terminates, except that the county shall continue to levy and 823
collect any taxes levied for the payment of indebtedness of the 824
district as it was composed at the time the indebtedness was 825
incurred. Upon the withdrawal of a county from a joint district, 826
the board of directors shall ascertain, apportion, and order a 827
division of the funds on hand, credits, and real and personal 828
property of the district, either in money or in kind, on any 829
equitable basis between the district and the withdrawing county 830

district entered into and ratified under division (A) of section 832
343.01 of the Revised Code and the prior contributions of the 833

directors shall ascertain, apportion, and order a final division 837
of the funds on hand, credits, and real and personal property of 838
the district. On and after the first day of January on which the 839

inventory of all existing solid waste disposal, transfer, and 1842
resource recovery facilities and recycling activities within the 1843
proposed district and estimates of the remaining capacity 1844
available at each such facility; estimates of the amounts of 1845
solid wastes that will be generated within the proposed district 1846
during each year of the subsequent ten-year period; an 1847
identification of the additional solid waste management 1848
facilities and capacity that the proposed district intends to 1849
provide to dispose of the estimated amounts of solid wastes; a 1850
schedule for implementation of the measures proposed in the 1851
statement; if appropriate, estimates of the capital and 1852
operating costs of the additional facilities that the district 1853
intends to provide and of the rates to be charged to meet those 1854
costs; and, if appropriate, rates to be charged to meet the 1855
costs of capacity that the district intends to provide by 1856
contract or agreement. 1857
The director shall approve or disapprove a statement and 1858

them. The director shall approve a statement and financial 1860
feasibility study only if they demonstrate a technically 1861
feasible and economically reasonable means of providing for the 1862
environmentally sound management of solid wastes generated in 1863
the district during the subsequent ten-year period. Otherwise, 1864
the director shall disapprove the statement and financial 1865
feasibility study. 1866
(3) Upon approving or disapproving a preliminary 1867
demonstration of capacity under division (E)(1) or (2) of this 1868
section, the director shall provide written notice of his 1869
decision to the solid waste management policy committee that 1870
submitted it. If the director disapproves the preliminary 1871
demonstration of any of the proposed districts, the change in 1872
district composition shall not occur. The solid waste management 1873
policy committee of each of the existing districts operating 1874
under a solid waste management plan approved under this section 1875
or section 3734.55 of the Revised Code or an amended plan 1876
approved under this section or section 3734.56 of the Revised 1877
Code then shall proceed to adopt and obtain approval of an 1878
amended plan in accordance with division (A) of section 3734.56 1879
of the Revised Code. If any of the existing districts is 1880
operating under a plan or an amended plan ordered to be 1881
implemented under this section or section 3734.55 or 3734.56 of 1882
the Revised Code, the director then shall proceed in accordance 1883
with division (B) of section 3734.56 of the Revised Code to 1884
prepare an amended plan for each such district and order the 1885
implementation of the amended plan. Division (E)(3) of this 1886
section does not preclude an existing district that is operating 1887
under a plan or amended plan prepared and ordered to be 1888
implemented by the director from proceeding under division (C) 1889
of section 3734.56 of the Revised Code to prepare and obtain 1890

approval of a plan to replace the initial or amended plan 1891
prepared by the director. 1892
(4) If the director approves the preliminary demonstration 1893
of each of the proposed districts resulting from the change in 1894
district composition under division (E)(1) or (2) of this 1895
section, the solid waste management policy committee of each of 1896
the proposed districts shall begin preparing a draft initial 1897
solid waste management plan for the district, and the committee 1898
of the remaining joint district, if any, shall begin preparing a 1899
draft amended plan for the joint district. The initial or 1900
amended plan and certification of capacity shall comply with 1901
divisions (A), (B), (D), and (E)(1) of section 3734.53 of the 1902
Revised Code. Upon completion of the draft initial or amended 1903
plan for the proposed district, the committee shall proceed to 1904
adopt and obtain approval of it in accordance with divisions 1905
(A), (B), and (C)(1) to (3) of section 3734.55 of the Revised 1906
Code. The initial plans of the proposed districts and the 1907
amended plan of the remaining joint district, if any, shall be 1908
submitted to the director at the same time and shall be 1909
submitted not later than twenty months after the proposed 1910
districts submitted their preliminary demonstrations of capacity 1911
under division (E)(1) or (2) of this section. If any of the 1912
proposed districts fails to submit its plan or amended plan to 1913
the director on or before the required date, the proposed change 1914
shall not occur, and the director then shall proceed in 1915
accordance with division (D) of section 3734.55 of the Revised 1916
Code to prepare an amended plan for each of the existing 1917
districts and to order the implementation of the amended plans. 1918
(F) If any of the proposed districts resulting from a 1919
change in district composition, or the remaining joint district, 1920
if any, that is required to submit a preliminary demonstration 1921

Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 65
As Passed by the House
of capacity under division (E)(1) or (2) of this section fails 1922
to obtain approval of its plan or amended plan within thirty- 1923
eight months after the submission of its preliminary 1924
demonstration of capacity, the director shall determine what 1925
actions are necessary to ensure that each county involved in the 1926
proposed change will be included in a district that either will 1927
have within its boundaries sufficient solid waste management 1928
facility capacity to provide for the disposal of all of the 1929
solid wastes generated within its boundaries during the 1930
subsequent ten-year period or will have access to sufficient 1931
capacity at facilities located outside the district or this 1932
state by contract or agreement to dispose of all of the solid 1933
wastes generated within the district during that ten-year 1934
period. Based upon that determination, the director shall do 1935
either of the following, as appropriate: 1936
(1) If the director determines that the solid waste 1937
management needs of each of the counties involved can be met if 1938
the proposed change were to occur, he shall prepare an initial 1939
or amended plan that complies with divisions (A) and (D) of 1940
section 3734.53 of the Revised Code for each of the proposed or 1941
existing districts that failed to obtain approval of its plan or 1942
amended plan within thirty-eight months after the districts were 1943
required to submit their preliminary demonstrations of capacity 1944
under division (E)(1) or (2) of this section. None of the plans 1945
or amended plans prepared by the director shall contain any of 1946
the provisions required or authorized to be included in plans 1947
submitted by districts under division (B), (C), or (E) of 1948
section 3734.53 of the Revised Code. Upon completion of each 1949
such plan or amended plan, the director shall issue an order in 1950
accordance with Chapter 3745. of the Revised Code directing the 1951
board of county commissioners or directors of the district for 1952

Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 66
As Passed by the House
which the plan or amended plan was prepared to implement it in 1953
compliance with the implementation schedule contained in it. 1954
(2) If the director determines that the solid waste 1955
management needs of each of the counties involved cannot be met 1956
if the proposed change in district composition were to occur, he 1957
shall make a determination as to how county or joint districts 1958
should be formed from among those counties to ensure that each 1959
will be included in a district that either will have within its 1960
boundaries sufficient solid waste management facility capacity 1961
to provide for the disposal of all the solid wastes generated 1962
within the district during the subsequent ten-year period or 1963
will have access to sufficient capacity at facilities located 1964
outside the district or this state by contract or agreement to 1965
dispose of all the solid wastes generated within the district 1966
during that ten-year period. After making his determination, the 1967
director shall prepare an initial or amended solid waste 1968
management plan for each of them. If the director determines 1969
that any existing district involved in the proposed change 1970
should be retained without a modification in its composition, 1971
the director shall prepare an amended plan for the district. The 1972
director shall prepare an initial or amended plan for each 1973
district whose composition would be changed under his 1974
determination. Each such plan or amended plan shall comply with 1975
divisions (A) and (D) of section 3734.53 of the Revised Code. 1976
None of the plans or amended plans shall contain any of the 1977
provisions required or authorized to be included in plans under 1978
division (B), (C), or (E) of that section. 1979
If a plan prepared under this division provides for the 1980
establishment of a joint district by two or more counties that 1981
had each previously formed a county district, the director, in 1982
accordance with Chapter 3745. of the Revised Code, shall issue 1983

Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 67
As Passed by the House
an order to the board of county commissioners of each of the 1984
counties directing them to enter into an agreement to form a 1985
joint district under division (A) of section 343.01 of the 1986
Revised Code within thirty days after the issuance of the order. 1987
If a plan or amended plan prepared by the director provides for 1988
the withdrawal of one or more counties from an existing joint 1989
district, the establishment of a new joint district, the joinder 1990
of one or more counties to an existing joint district, or the 1991
union of two or more existing joint districts, the director, in 1992
accordance with Chapter 3745. of the Revised Code, shall issue 1993
appropriate orders to the board of county commissioners of each 1994
county or existing county district and to the board of directors 1995
of each joint district that will be affected by the plan 1996

thirty days after the issuance of the order, to adopt the 1998
appropriate resolutions and enter into any necessary agreements 1999
under division (B) of section 343.01 of the Revised Code to 2000
effect the changes provided for in the plan. The requirements 2001
and procedures for approval of the withdrawal from, 2002
establishment of, joinder to, or union of districts under 2003
section 343.012 of the Revised Code do not apply to changes 2004
ordered under division (F)(2) of this section. The other 2005
provisions of that section do apply to changes ordered under 2006
division (F)(2) of this section. 2007
Any order issued by the director under division (F)(2) of 2008

severed county and such committee of the county or counties of 2159
the remaining district may form or join a joint solid waste 2160
management district or a regional solid waste management 2161
authority as provided in this chapter and Chapter 343. of the 2162
Revised Code. However, in no circumstance shall the director 2163

Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 73
As Passed by the House
require the county or counties to form or join a joint district 2164
or regional solid waste management authority. 2165
(H) In the case of a joint solid waste management district 2166
that is managed by a board of trustees of a regional solid waste 2167
management authority and that is operating under an agreement 2168
entered into pursuant to section 343.011 of the Revised Code, 2169
any withdrawal of a county from the district is subject to the 2170
following: 2171

county that is a member of the joint district may withdraw from 2174
the district only pursuant to that agreement. 2175
(2) If the agreement does not govern the withdrawal of a 2176
county from the joint district, the board of county 2177
commissioners of a county that is a member of the joint district 2178

In the case of solid wastes that are taken to a solid 2728
waste transfer facility located in this state prior to being 2729
transported for disposal at a solid waste disposal facility 2730
located in this state or outside of this state, the fees levied 2731
under this division shall be collected by the owner or operator 2732
of the transfer facility as a trustee for the state. The amount 2733
of fees required to be collected under this division at such a 2734
transfer facility shall equal the total tonnage of solid wastes 2735
received at the facility multiplied by the fees levied under 2736
this division. In the case of solid wastes that are not taken to 2737
a solid waste transfer facility located in this state prior to 2738
being transported to a solid waste disposal facility, the fees 2739
shall be collected by the owner or operator of the solid waste 2740
disposal facility as a trustee for the state. The amount of fees 2741
required to be collected under this division at such a disposal 2742
facility shall equal the total tonnage of solid wastes received 2743
at the facility that was not previously taken to a solid waste 2744
transfer facility located in this state multiplied by the fees 2745
levied under this division. Fees levied under this division do 2746
not apply to materials separated from a mixed waste stream for 2747
recycling by a generator or materials removed from the solid 2748
waste stream through recycling, as "recycling" is defined in 2749
rules adopted under section 3734.02 of the Revised Code. 2750
The owner or operator of a solid waste transfer facility 2751
or disposal facility, as applicable, shall prepare and file with 2752
the director of environmental protection each month a return 2753
indicating the total tonnage of solid wastes received at the 2754
facility during that month and the total amount of the fees 2755
required to be collected under this division during that month. 2756
In addition, the owner or operator of a solid waste disposal 2757
facility shall indicate on the return the total tonnage of solid 2758

Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 93
As Passed by the House
wastes received from transfer facilities located in this state 2759
during that month for which the fees were required to be 2760
collected by the transfer facilities. The monthly returns shall 2761
be filed on a form prescribed by the director. Not later than 2762
thirty days after the last day of the month to which a return 2763
applies, the owner or operator shall mail to the director the 2764
return for that month together with the fees required to be 2765
collected under this division during that month as indicated on 2766
the return or may submit the return and fees electronically in a 2767
manner approved by the director. If the return is filed and the 2768
amount of the fees due is paid in a timely manner as required in 2769
this division, the owner or operator may retain a discount of 2770
three-fourths of one per cent of the total amount of the fees 2771
that are required to be paid as indicated on the return. 2772
The owner or operator may request an extension of not more 2773
than thirty days for filing the return and remitting the fees, 2774
provided that the owner or operator has submitted such a request 2775
in writing to the director together with a detailed description 2776
of why the extension is requested, the director has received the 2777
request not later than the day on which the return is required 2778
to be filed, and the director has approved the request. If the 2779
fees are not remitted within thirty days after the last day of 2780
the month to which the return applies or are not remitted by the 2781
last day of an extension approved by the director, the owner or 2782
operator shall not retain the three-fourths of one per cent 2783
discount and shall pay an additional ten per cent of the amount 2784
of the fees for each month that they are late. For purposes of 2785
calculating the late fee, the first month in which fees are late 2786
begins on the first day after the deadline has passed for timely 2787
submitting the return and fees, and one additional month shall 2788
be counted every thirty days thereafter. 2789

The owner or operator of a solid waste facility may 2790
request a refund or credit of fees levied under this division 2791
and remitted to the director that have not been paid to the 2792
owner or operator. Such a request shall be made only if the fees 2793
have not been collected by the owner or operator, have become a 2794
debt that has become worthless or uncollectable for a period of 2795
six months or more, and may be claimed as a deduction, including 2796
a deduction claimed if the owner or operator keeps accounts on 2797
an accrual basis, under the "Internal Revenue Code of 1954," 68A 2798
Stat. 50, 26 U.S.C. 166, as amended, and regulations adopted 2799
under it. Prior to making a request for a refund or credit, an 2800
owner or operator shall make reasonable efforts to collect the 2801
applicable fees. A request for a refund or credit shall not 2802
include any costs resulting from those efforts to collect unpaid 2803
fees. 2804
A request for a refund or credit of fees shall be made in 2805
writing, on a form prescribed by the director, and shall be 2806
supported by evidence that may be required in rules adopted by 2807
the director under this chapter. After reviewing the request, 2808
and if the request and evidence submitted with the request 2809
indicate that a refund or credit is warranted, the director 2810
shall grant a refund to the owner or operator or shall permit a 2811
credit to be taken by the owner or operator on a subsequent 2812
monthly return submitted by the owner or operator. The amount of 2813
a refund or credit shall not exceed an amount that is equal to 2814
ninety days' worth of fees owed to an owner or operator by a 2815
particular debtor of the owner or operator. A refund or credit 2816
shall not be granted by the director to an owner or operator 2817
more than once in any twelve-month period for fees owed to the 2818
owner or operator by a particular debtor. 2819
If, after receiving a refund or credit from the director, 2820

Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 95
As Passed by the House
an owner or operator receives payment of all or part of the 2821
fees, the owner or operator shall remit the fees with the next 2822
monthly return submitted to the director together with a written 2823
explanation of the reason for the submittal. 2824
For purposes of computing the fees levied under this 2825
division or division (B) of this section, any solid waste 2826
transfer or disposal facility that does not use scales as a 2827
means of determining gate receipts shall use a conversion factor 2828
of three cubic yards per ton of solid waste or one cubic yard 2829
per ton for baled waste, as applicable. 2830
The fees levied under this division and divisions (B) and 2831
(C) of this section are in addition to all other applicable fees 2832
and taxes and shall be paid by the customer or a political 2833
subdivision to the owner or operator of a solid waste transfer 2834
or disposal facility. In the alternative, the fees shall be paid 2835
by a customer or political subdivision to a transporter of waste 2836
who subsequently transfers the fees to the owner or operator of 2837
such a facility. The fees shall be paid notwithstanding the 2838
existence of any provision in a contract that the customer or a 2839
political subdivision may have with the owner or operator or 2840
with a transporter of waste to the facility that would not 2841
require or allow such payment regardless of whether the contract 2842
was entered prior to or after October 16, 2009. For those 2843
purposes, "customer" means a person who contracts with, or 2844
utilizes the solid waste services of, the owner or operator of a 2845
solid waste transfer or disposal facility or a transporter of 2846
solid waste to such a facility. 2847
(B) For the purposes specified in division (G) of this 2848
section, the solid waste management policy committee of a county 2849
or joint solid waste management district may levy fees upon the 2850

As Passed by the House
following activities: 2851
(1) The disposal at a solid waste disposal facility 2852
located in the district of solid wastes generated within the 2853
district; 2854
(2) The disposal at a solid waste disposal facility within 2855
the district of solid wastes generated outside the boundaries of 2856
the district, but inside this state; 2857
(3) The disposal at a solid waste disposal facility within 2858
the district of solid wastes generated outside the boundaries of 2859
this state. 2860
The solid waste management plan of the county or joint 2861
district approved under section 3734.521 or 3734.55 of the 2862
Revised Code and any amendments to it, or the resolution adopted 2863
under this division, as appropriate, shall establish the rates 2864
of the fees levied under divisions (B)(1), (2), and (3) of this 2865
section, if any, and shall specify whether the fees are levied 2866
on the basis of tons or cubic yards as the unit of measurement. 2867
A solid waste management district that levies fees under this 2868
division on the basis of cubic yards shall do so in accordance 2869
with division (A) of this section. 2870
The fee levied under division (B)(1) of this section shall 2871
be not less than one dollar per ton nor more than two dollars 2872
per ton, the fee levied under division (B)(2) of this section 2873
shall be not less than two dollars per ton nor more than four 2874
dollars per ton, and the fee levied under division (B)(3) of 2875
this section shall be not more than the fee levied under 2876

As Passed by the House
solid waste management policy committee of a district may levy 2880
fees under this division by adopting a resolution establishing 2881
the proposed amount of the fees. Upon adopting the resolution, 2882
the committee shall deliver a copy of the resolution to the 2883
board of county commissioners of each county forming the 2884
district and to the legislative authority of each municipal 2885
corporation and township under the jurisdiction of the district 2886
and shall prepare and publish the resolution and a notice of the 2887
time and location where a public hearing on the fees will be 2888
held. Upon adopting the resolution, the committee shall deliver 2889
written notice of the adoption of the resolution; of the amount 2890
of the proposed fees; and of the date, time, and location of the 2891
public hearing to the director and to the fifty industrial, 2892
commercial, or institutional generators of solid wastes within 2893
the district that generate the largest quantities of solid 2894
wastes, as determined by the committee, and to their local trade 2895
associations. The committee shall make good faith efforts to 2896
identify those generators within the district and their local 2897
trade associations, but the nonprovision of notice under this 2898
division to a particular generator or local trade association 2899
does not invalidate the proceedings under this division. The 2900
publication shall occur at least thirty days before the hearing. 2901
After the hearing, the committee may make such revisions to the 2902
proposed fees as it considers appropriate and thereafter, by 2903
resolution, shall adopt the revised fee schedule. Upon adopting 2904
the revised fee schedule, the committee shall deliver a copy of 2905
the resolution doing so to the board of county commissioners of 2906
each county forming the district and to the legislative 2907
authority of each municipal corporation and township under the 2908
jurisdiction of the district. Within sixty days after the 2909
delivery of a copy of the resolution adopting the proposed 2910
revised fees by the policy committee, each such board and 2911

Sub. S. B. No. 147 Page 98
As Passed by the House
legislative authority, by ordinance or resolution, shall approve 2912
or disapprove the revised fees and deliver a copy of the 2913
ordinance or resolution to the committee. If any such board or 2914
legislative authority fails to adopt and deliver to the policy 2915
committee an ordinance or resolution approving or disapproving 2916
the revised fees within sixty days after the policy committee 2917
delivered its resolution adopting the proposed revised fees, it 2918
shall be conclusively presumed that the board or legislative 2919
authority has approved the proposed revised fees. The committee 2920
shall determine if the resolution has been ratified in the same 2921
manner in which it determines if a draft solid waste management 2922
plan has been ratified under division (B) of section 3734.55 of 2923
the Revised Code. 2924
The committee may amend the schedule of fees levied 2925
pursuant to a resolution adopted and ratified under this 2926
division by adopting a resolution establishing the proposed 2927
amount of the amended fees. The committee may repeal the fees 2928
levied pursuant to such a resolution by adopting a resolution 2929
proposing to repeal them. Upon adopting such a resolution, the 2930
committee shall proceed to obtain ratification of the resolution 2931
in accordance with this division. 2932
Not later than fourteen days after declaring the new fees 2933
to be ratified or the fees to be repealed under this division, 2934
the committee shall notify by certified mail the owner or 2935
operator of each solid waste disposal facility that is required 2936
to collect the fees of the ratification and the amount of the 2937
fees or of the repeal of the fees. Collection of any fees shall 2938
commence or collection of repealed fees shall cease on the first 2939
day of the second month following the month in which 2940
notification is sent to the owner or operator. 2941

Fees levied under this division also may be established, 2942
amended, or repealed by a solid waste management policy 2943
committee through the adoption of a new district solid waste 2944
management plan, the adoption of an amended plan, or the 2945
amendment of the plan or amended plan in accordance with 2946
sections 3734.55 and 3734.56 of the Revised Code or the adoption 2947
or amendment of a district plan in connection with a change in 2948
district composition under section 3734.521 of the Revised Code. 2949
Not later than fourteen days after the director issues an 2950
order approving a district's solid waste management plan, 2951
amended plan, or amendment to a plan or amended plan that 2952
establishes, amends, or repeals a schedule of fees levied by the 2953
district, the committee shall notify by certified mail the owner 2954

required to collect the fees of the approval of the plan or 2956
amended plan, or the amendment to the plan, as appropriate, and 2957
the amount of the fees, if any. In the case of an initial or 2958
amended plan approved under section 3734.521 of the Revised Code 2959
in connection with a change in district composition, other than 2960
one involving the withdrawal of a county from a joint district, 2961

first day of the second month following the month in which 3014
notification is sent to the owner or operator. 3015
If the schedule of fees that a solid waste management 3016

municipal corporation or township of maintaining roads and other 3038
public facilities and of providing emergency and other public 3039
services, and compensating a municipal corporation or township 3040
for reductions in real property tax revenues due to reductions 3041
in real property valuations resulting from the location and 3042
operation of a solid waste disposal facility within the 3043
municipal corporation or township, a municipal corporation or 3044
township in which such a solid waste disposal facility is 3045
located may levy a fee of not more than twenty-five cents per 3046
ton on the disposal of solid wastes at a solid waste disposal 3047
facility located within the boundaries of the municipal 3048
corporation or township regardless of where the wastes were 3049
generated. 3050
The legislative authority of a municipal corporation or 3051
township may levy fees under this division by enacting an 3052
ordinance or adopting a resolution establishing the amount of 3053
the fees. Upon so doing the legislative authority shall mail a 3054
certified copy of the ordinance or resolution to the board of 3055
county commissioners or directors of the county or joint solid 3056
waste management district in which the municipal corporation or 3057
township is located or, if a regional solid waste management 3058
authority has been formed under section 343.011 of the Revised 3059
Code, to the board of trustees of that regional authority, the 3060
owner or operator of each solid waste disposal facility in the 3061
municipal corporation or township that is required to collect 3062
the fee by the ordinance or resolution, and the director of 3063
environmental protection. Although the fees levied under this 3064
division are levied on the basis of tons as the unit of 3065

the fees be levied on the basis of cubic yards as the unit of 3068
measurement based upon a conversion factor of three cubic yards 3069
per ton generally or one cubic yard per ton for baled wastes. 3070
Not later than five days after enacting an ordinance or 3071
adopting a resolution under this division, the legislative 3072
authority shall so notify by certified mail the owner or 3073
operator of each solid waste disposal facility that is required 3074
to collect the fee. Collection of any fee levied on or after 3075
March 24, 1992, shall commence on the first day of the second 3076
month following the month in which notification is sent to the 3077
owner or operator. 3078

of this section do not apply to the disposal of solid wastes 3080
that: 3081
(a) Are disposed of at a facility owned by the generator 3082
of the wastes when the solid waste facility exclusively disposes 3083
of solid wastes generated at one or more premises owned by the 3084
generator regardless of whether the facility is located on a 3085
premises where the wastes are generated; 3086
(b) Are generated from the combustion of coal, or from the 3087
combustion of primarily coal, regardless of whether the disposal 3088
facility is located on the premises where the wastes are 3089
generated; 3090
(c) Are asbestos or asbestos-containing materials or 3091
products disposed of at a construction and demolition debris 3092

a proposed budget for the expenditure of moneys from the special 3407
fund of the district created under division (G) of section 3408
3734.57 of the Revised Code. The proposed budget shall be 3409
submitted on a form prescribed by the director. 3410
The director may disapprove in whole or in part such a 3411
proposed quarterly budget for any of the following reasons: 3412
(1) The proposed budget includes expenditures for any 3413
purpose other than those authorized under divisions (G)(1) to 3414
(10)division (G) of section 3734.57 of the Revised Code; 3415

(6) There have been repeated inconsistencies between the 3430
expenditures projected in the proposed budgets submitted under 3431
division (E) of this section and actual expenditures from the 3432
fund. 3433
If the director does not disapprove a proposed quarterly 3434
budget prior to the first day of the calendar quarter to which 3435
it pertains, it is conclusively presumed that the proposed 3436
budget has not been disapproved. 3437

board of county commissioners or directors of a district from 3439
making necessary expenditures to meet unforeseen circumstances 3440
that occur during a calendar quarter that were not provided for 3441
in the proposed budget for that quarter. Prior to making any 3442
such expenditure, the board shall notify the director of the 3443
nature of the unforeseen circumstances and of the amount of the 3444
expenditure needed to meet them. The board shall include an 3445
explanation of the nature of the unforeseen circumstances and of 3446
the necessity and amount of the expenditures to meet them in the 3447
quarterly expenditure report for the quarter in which the 3448
expenditures were made that is submitted to the director under 3449
section 3734.575 of the Revised Code. 3450
