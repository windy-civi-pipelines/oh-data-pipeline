shall be ratified by resolution of the board of county 50
commissioners of each participating county. Upon ratification, 51
the board of directors shall take control of and manage the 52
joint district subject to this chapter, except that, in the case 53
of a joint district formed pursuant to division (C)(B), (D)(C), 54
or (E) (D) of section 343.012 of the Revised Code, the board of 55
directors shall take control of and manage the district when the 56

A county participating in a joint district may contribute 60
lands or rights or interests therein, money, other personal 61

therein, contributed to or otherwise acquired by the joint 66
district. The agreement may be amended or added to by a majority 67

manner that may be agreed upon. 81
The board of directors shall do one of the following: 82

district as the fiscal officer of the district, and the county 86
treasurer, or other official acting in a capacity similar to a 87
county treasurer under a county charter, of that county as the 88
treasurer of the district. The designated county officials shall 89
perform any applicable duties for the district as each typically 90
performs for the county of which the individual is an official, 91
except as otherwise may be provided in any bylaws or resolutions 92
adopted by the board of directors. The board of directors may 93
pay to that county any amount agreed upon by the board of 94
directors and the board of county commissioners of that county 95
to reimburse that county for the cost properly allocable to the 96
service of its officials as fiscal officer and treasurer of the 97
joint district. 98
(2) Appoint one individual who is neither a county auditor 99

or board of directors of a joint district may acquire, by 112
purchase or lease, construct, improve, enlarge, replace, 113
maintain, and operate such solid waste collection systems within 114
their respective districts and such solid waste facilities 115
within or outside their respective districts as are necessary 116
for the protection of the public health. A board of county 117
commissioners may acquire within its county real property or any 118
estate, interest, or right therein, by appropriation or any 119
other method, for use by a county or joint district in 120
connection with such facilities. Appropriation proceedings shall 121
be conducted in accordance with sections 163.01 to 163.22 of the 122
Revised Code. 123
(D) The sanitary engineer or sanitary engineering 124
department of a county maintaining a district and any sanitary 125
engineer or sanitary engineering department of a county in a 126
joint district, as determined by the board of directors, in 127
addition to other duties assigned to that engineer or 128
department, shall assist the board of county commissioners or 129
directors in the performance of their duties under this chapter 130
and sections 3734.52 to 3734.575 of the Revised Code and shall 131
be charged with any other duties and services in relation 132
thereto that the board prescribes. A board may employ registered 133
professional engineers to assist the sanitary engineer in those 134
duties and also may employ financial advisers and any other 135
professional services it considers necessary to assist it in the 136
construction, financing, and maintenance of solid waste 137
collection or other solid waste facilities. Such contracts of 138
employment shall not require the certificate provided in section 139

for that use at times that are agreed upon or as determined by 142
the board of county commissioners or directors, and the funds 143
may be reimbursed from the proceeds of bonds or notes issued to 144
pay the cost of any improvement to which the services related. 145
(E)(1) The prosecuting attorney of the county shall serve 146
as the legal advisor of a county district and shall provide such 147
services to the board of county commissioners of the district as 148
are required or authorized to be provided to other county boards 149
under Chapter 309. of the Revised Code, except that, if the 150
board considers it to be necessary or appropriate, the board, on 151
its own initiative, may employ an attorney or other legal 152
counsel on an annual basis to serve as the legal advisor of the 153
district in place of the prosecuting attorney. When the 154
prosecuting attorney is serving as the district's legal advisor 155
and the board considers it to be necessary or appropriate, the 156
board, on its own initiative, may employ an attorney or other 157
legal counsel to represent or advise the board regarding a 158
particular matter in place of the prosecuting attorney. The 159
employment of an attorney or other legal counsel on an annual 160
basis or in a particular matter is not subject to or governed by 161

Section 10:
sections 305.14 and 309.09 of the Revised Code. 162
Notwithstanding the employment of an attorney or other 163
legal counsel on an annual basis to serve as the district's 164
legal advisor, the board may require written opinions or 165
instructions from the prosecuting attorney under section 309.09 166
of the Revised Code in matters connected with its official 167
duties as though the prosecuting attorney were serving as the 168
legal advisor of the district. 169
(2) The board of directors of a joint district may 170
designate the prosecuting attorney of one of the counties 171
S. B. No. 147 Page 7
As Introduced
forming the district to serve as the legal advisor of the 172
district. When so designated, the prosecuting attorney shall 173
provide such services to the joint district as are required or 174
authorized to be provided to county boards under Chapter 309. of 175
the Revised Code. The board of directors may pay to that county 176
any amount agreed upon by the board of directors and the board 177
of county commissioners of that county to reimburse that county 178
for the cost properly allocable to the services of its 179
prosecuting attorney as the legal advisor of the joint district. 180
When that prosecuting attorney is so serving and the board 181
considers it to be necessary or appropriate, the board, on its 182
own initiative, may employ an attorney or other legal counsel to 183
represent or advise the board regarding a particular matter in 184
place of the prosecuting attorney. 185
Instead of designating the prosecuting attorney of one of 186
the counties forming the district to be the legal advisor of the 187
district, the board of directors may employ on an annual basis 188
an attorney or other legal counsel to serve as the district's 189
legal advisor. Notwithstanding the employment of an attorney or 190
other legal counsel as the district's legal advisor, the board 191
of directors may require written opinions or instructions from 192
the prosecuting attorney of any of the counties forming the 193
district in matters connected with the board's official duties, 194
and the prosecuting attorney shall provide the written opinion 195
or instructions as though the prosecuting attorney had been 196
designated to serve as the district's legal advisor under 197
division (E)(2) of this section. 198
(F) A board of county commissioners may issue bonds or 199
bond anticipation notes of the county to pay the cost of 200
preparing general and detailed plans and other data required for 201
the construction of solid waste facilities in connection with a 202

county or joint district. A board of directors of a joint solid 203
waste management district may issue bonds or bond anticipation 204
notes of the joint solid waste management district to pay the 205
cost of preparing general and detailed plans and other data 206
required for the construction of solid waste facilities in 207
connection with a joint district. The bonds and notes shall be 208
issued in accordance with Chapter 133. of the Revised Code, 209
except that the maximum maturity of bonds issued for that 210
purpose shall not exceed ten years. Bond anticipation notes may 211
be paid from the proceeds of bonds issued either to pay the cost 212
of the solid waste facilities or to pay the cost of the plans 213
and other data. 214
(G) To the extent authorized by the solid waste management 215
plan of the district approved under section 3734.521 or 3734.55 216
of the Revised Code or subsequent amended plans of the district 217
approved under section 3734.521 or 3734.56 of the Revised Code, 218
the board of county commissioners of a county district or board 219
of directors of a joint district may adopt, publish, and enforce 220
rules doing any of the following: 221
(1) Prohibiting or limiting the receipt of solid wastes 222
generated outside the district or outside a service area 223
prescribed in the solid waste management plan or amended plan, 224
at facilities located within the solid waste management 225
district, consistent with the projections contained in the plan 226
or amended plan under divisions (A)(6) and (7) of section 227

Section 11:
3734.53 of the Revised Code. However, rules adopted by a board 228
under division (G)(1) of this section may be adopted and 229
enforced with respect to solid waste disposal facilities in the 230
solid waste management district that are not owned by a county 231
or the solid waste management district only if the board submits 232
an application to the director of environmental protection that 233
S. B. No. 147 Page 9
As Introduced
demonstrates that there is insufficient capacity to dispose of 234
all solid wastes that are generated within the district at the 235
solid waste disposal facilities located within the district and 236
the director approves the application. The demonstration in the 237
application shall be based on projections contained in the plan 238
or amended plan of the district. The director shall establish 239
the form of the application. The approval or disapproval of such 240
an application by the director is an action that is appealable 241
under section 3745.04 of the Revised Code. 242
In addition, the director of environmental protection may 243
issue an order modifying a rule adopted under division (G)(1) of 244
this section to allow the disposal in the district of solid 245
wastes from another county or joint solid waste management 246
district if all of the following apply: 247
(a) The district in which the wastes were generated does 248
not have sufficient capacity to dispose of solid wastes 249
generated within it for six months following the date of the 250
director's order. 251
(b) No new solid waste facilities will begin operation 252
during those six months in the district in which the wastes were 253
generated and, despite good faith efforts to do so, it is 254
impossible to site new solid waste facilities within the 255
district because of its high population density. 256
(c) The district in which the wastes were generated has 257
made good faith efforts to negotiate with other districts to 258
incorporate its disposal needs within those districts' solid 259
waste management plans, including efforts to develop joint 260
facilities authorized under section 343.02 of the Revised Code, 261
and the efforts have been unsuccessful. 262
S. B. No. 147 Page 10
As Introduced
(d) The district in which the wastes were generated has 263
located a facility willing to accept the district's solid wastes 264
for disposal within the receiving district. 265
(e) The district in which the wastes were generated has 266
demonstrated to the director that the conditions specified in 267
divisions (G)(1)(a) to (d) of this section have been met. 268
(f) The director finds that the issuance of the order will 269
be consistent with the state solid waste management plan and 270
that receipt of the out-of-district wastes will not limit the 271
capacity of the receiving district to dispose of its in-district 272
wastes to less than eight years. 273
Any order issued under division (G)(1) of this section 274
shall not become final until thirty days after it has been 275
served upon the county or joint solid waste management district 276
that will receive the out-of-district wastes either by certified 277
mail or, if the director has record of an internet identifier of 278
record associated with the district, by ordinary mail and by 279
that internet identifier of record. 280
(2) Governing the maintenance, protection, and use of 281
solid waste collection or other solid waste facilities located 282
within its district. The rules adopted under division (G)(2) of 283
this section shall not establish design standards for solid 284
waste facilities and shall be consistent with the solid waste 285
provisions of Chapter 3734. of the Revised Code and the rules 286
adopted under those provisions. The rules adopted under division 287
(G)(2) of this section may prohibit any person, municipal 288
corporation, township, or other political subdivision from 289
constructing, enlarging, or modifying any solid waste facility 290
until general plans and specifications for the proposed 291
improvement have been submitted to and approved by the board of 292

county commissioners or board of directors as complying with the 293
solid waste management plan or amended plan of the district. The 294
construction of such a facility shall be done under the 295
supervision of the county sanitary engineer or, in the case of a 296
joint district, a county sanitary engineer designated by the 297
board of directors, and any person, municipal corporation, 298
township, or other political subdivision proposing or 299
constructing such improvements shall pay to the county or joint 300
district all expenses incurred by the board in connection 301
therewith. The sanitary engineer may enter upon any public or 302
private property for the purpose of making surveys or 303
examinations necessary for designing solid waste facilities or 304
for supervising the construction, enlargement, modification, or 305
operation of any such facilities. No person, municipal 306
corporation, township, or other political subdivision shall 307
forbid or interfere with the sanitary engineer or the sanitary 308
engineer's authorized assistants entering upon such property for 309
that purpose. If actual damage is done to property by the making 310
of the surveys and examinations, a board shall pay the 311
reasonable value of that damage to the owner of the property 312
damaged, and the cost shall be included in the financing of the 313
improvement for which the surveys and examinations are made. 314
(3) Governing the development and implementation of a 315
program for the inspection of solid wastes generated outside the 316
boundaries of this state that are disposed of at solid waste 317
facilities included in the district's solid waste management 318
plan or amended plan. A board of county commissioners or board 319
of directors or its authorized representative may enter upon the 320
premises of any solid waste facility included in the district's 321
solid waste management plan or amended plan for the purpose of 322
conducting the inspections required or authorized by the rules 323

or directors or its authorized representative entering upon the 327
premises of any such solid waste facility for that purpose. 328
(4) Exempting the owner or operator of any existing or 329
proposed solid waste facility provided for in the plan or 330
amended plan from compliance with any amendment to a township 331
zoning resolution adopted under section 519.12 of the Revised 332
Code or to a county rural zoning resolution adopted under 333

Section 12:

the parcel or parcels upon which the facility is to be 335
constructed or modified and that became effective within two 336
years prior to the filing of an application for a permit 337
required under division (A)(2)(a) of section 3734.05 of the 338
Revised Code to open a new or modify an existing solid waste 339
facility. 340

may enter into a contract with any person, municipal 342
corporation, township, or other political subdivision for the 343
operation and maintenance of any solid waste facilities 344
regardless of whether the facilities are owned or leased by the 345
county or joint district or the contractor. 346
(I)(1) No person, municipal corporation, township, or 347
other political subdivision shall tamper with or damage any 348
solid waste facility constructed under this chapter or any 349
apparatus or accessory connected therewith or pertaining 350

established facility designations in the initial or amended plan 364
of the district prepared and ordered to be implemented under 365

Section 15:

county commissioners of a county district or board of directors 378
of a joint district may grant a waiver authorizing the delivery 379

implemented under section 3734.521, 3734.55, or 3734.56 of the 385
Revised Code, as applicable, regardless of whether the other 386
facility is located within or outside of the district, if the 387
board finds that delivery of those solid wastes to the other 388
facility is not inconsistent with the projections contained in 389
the district's initial or amended plan under divisions (A)(6) 390
and (7) of section 3734.53 of the Revised Code as approved or 391
ordered to be implemented and will not adversely affect the 392
implementation and financing of the district's initial or 393
amended plan pursuant to the implementation schedule contained 394
in it under divisions (A)(12)(a) to (d) of that section. The 395

days after receiving the request. Upon granting such a waiver, 397
the board shall send notice of that fact to the director. The 398
notice shall indicate to whom the waiver was granted. Any waiver 399
or authorization granted by a board on or before October 29, 400

instructions from the prosecuting attorney of the county or, in 737
the case of a joint district, any of the counties forming the 738
district in matters connected with the board's official duties, 739
and the prosecuting attorney shall provide the written opinion 740
or instructions as though he the prosecuting attorney had been 741
designated to serve as the authority's legal advisor under this 742
division. 743

interest through affiliation with a waste management company or 748
with any entity that is a significant generator of solid wastes 749
shall be added to the board of trustees of a regional authority 750
formed in a county district. In the case of a regional authority 751
formed in a joint district, one member shall be added to the 752
board of trustees from each county that is a member of the joint 753
district to represent industrial, commercial, or institutional 754
generators of solid wastes within the county, and one member 755
shall be added to the board from each such county to represent 756
the general interests of citizens who shall have no conflict of 757
interest through affiliation with a waste management company or 758
with any entity that is a significant generator of solid wastes. 759
The members representing generators and the general interests of 760
citizens shall be added to the board of trustees without the 761
necessity for amending the agreement to form the regional 762
authority. They shall be appointed in the same manner as the 763
public member of the board is required to be appointed under 764
this section and shall serve for terms of the same length as the 765
other members, as provided in the agreement. 766

deliver a copy of the resolution to the board of directors. If 794
any of the other boards of county commissioners adopts a 795
resolution of disapproval, the board of directors shall declare 796
the proposed withdrawal to be disapproved and shall deliver 797
written notice of the disapproval to the boards of county 798
commissioners of the affected counties. If all of the other 799
boards of county commissioners adopt a resolution approving the 800
proposed withdrawal, the board of directors shall declare the 801
withdrawal to be approved and shall deliver written notice of 802
the approval to the boards of county commissioners of the 803
affected counties. The board of directors shall determine 804
whether the withdrawal has been approved or disapproved and 805

terminates, except that the county shall continue to levy and 822
collect any taxes levied for the payment of indebtedness of the 823
district as it was composed at the time the indebtedness was 824
incurred. Upon the withdrawal of a county from a joint district, 825
the board of directors shall ascertain, apportion, and order a 826
division of the funds on hand, credits, and real and personal 827
property of the district, either in money or in kind, on any 828
equitable basis between the district and the withdrawing county 829

district entered into and ratified under division (A) of section 831

Section 36:

of the funds on hand, credits, and real and personal property of 837
the district. On and after the first day of January on which the 838

for the payment of the indebtedness in support of the joint 843
district in the amounts established by the agreement at the time 844
the indebtedness was incurred. 845

which the plan or amended plan was prepared to implement it in 1930
compliance with the implementation schedule contained in it. 1931
(2) If the director determines that the solid waste 1932
management needs of each of the counties involved cannot be met 1933
if the proposed change in district composition were to occur, he 1934
shall make a determination as to how county or joint districts 1935
should be formed from among those counties to ensure that each 1936
will be included in a district that either will have within its 1937
boundaries sufficient solid waste management facility capacity 1938
to provide for the disposal of all the solid wastes generated 1939
within the district during the subsequent ten-year period or 1940
will have access to sufficient capacity at facilities located 1941
outside the district or this state by contract or agreement to 1942
dispose of all the solid wastes generated within the district 1943
during that ten-year period. After making his determination, the 1944
director shall prepare an initial or amended solid waste 1945
management plan for each of them. If the director determines 1946
that any existing district involved in the proposed change 1947
should be retained without a modification in its composition, 1948
the director shall prepare an amended plan for the district. The 1949
director shall prepare an initial or amended plan for each 1950
district whose composition would be changed under his 1951

In the case of solid wastes that are taken to a solid 2653
waste transfer facility located in this state prior to being 2654
transported for disposal at a solid waste disposal facility 2655
located in this state or outside of this state, the fees levied 2656
under this division shall be collected by the owner or operator 2657
of the transfer facility as a trustee for the state. The amount 2658
of fees required to be collected under this division at such a 2659
transfer facility shall equal the total tonnage of solid wastes 2660
received at the facility multiplied by the fees levied under 2661
this division. In the case of solid wastes that are not taken to 2662
a solid waste transfer facility located in this state prior to 2663
being transported to a solid waste disposal facility, the fees 2664
shall be collected by the owner or operator of the solid waste 2665
disposal facility as a trustee for the state. The amount of fees 2666
required to be collected under this division at such a disposal 2667
facility shall equal the total tonnage of solid wastes received 2668
at the facility that was not previously taken to a solid waste 2669
transfer facility located in this state multiplied by the fees 2670
levied under this division. Fees levied under this division do 2671
not apply to materials separated from a mixed waste stream for 2672
recycling by a generator or materials removed from the solid 2673

As Introduced
The owner or operator of a solid waste transfer facility 2676
or disposal facility, as applicable, shall prepare and file with 2677
the director of environmental protection each month a return 2678
indicating the total tonnage of solid wastes received at the 2679
facility during that month and the total amount of the fees 2680
required to be collected under this division during that month. 2681
In addition, the owner or operator of a solid waste disposal 2682
facility shall indicate on the return the total tonnage of solid 2683
wastes received from transfer facilities located in this state 2684
during that month for which the fees were required to be 2685
collected by the transfer facilities. The monthly returns shall 2686
be filed on a form prescribed by the director. Not later than 2687
thirty days after the last day of the month to which a return 2688
applies, the owner or operator shall mail to the director the 2689
return for that month together with the fees required to be 2690
collected under this division during that month as indicated on 2691
the return or may submit the return and fees electronically in a 2692
manner approved by the director. If the return is filed and the 2693
amount of the fees due is paid in a timely manner as required in 2694
this division, the owner or operator may retain a discount of 2695
three-fourths of one per cent of the total amount of the fees 2696
that are required to be paid as indicated on the return. 2697
The owner or operator may request an extension of not more 2698
than thirty days for filing the return and remitting the fees, 2699
provided that the owner or operator has submitted such a request 2700
in writing to the director together with a detailed description 2701
of why the extension is requested, the director has received the 2702
request not later than the day on which the return is required 2703
to be filed, and the director has approved the request. If the 2704
fees are not remitted within thirty days after the last day of 2705
the month to which the return applies or are not remitted by the 2706
S. B. No. 147 Page 91
As Introduced
last day of an extension approved by the director, the owner or 2707
operator shall not retain the three-fourths of one per cent 2708
discount and shall pay an additional ten per cent of the amount 2709
of the fees for each month that they are late. For purposes of 2710
calculating the late fee, the first month in which fees are late 2711
begins on the first day after the deadline has passed for timely 2712
submitting the return and fees, and one additional month shall 2713
be counted every thirty days thereafter. 2714
The owner or operator of a solid waste facility may 2715
request a refund or credit of fees levied under this division 2716
and remitted to the director that have not been paid to the 2717
owner or operator. Such a request shall be made only if the fees 2718
have not been collected by the owner or operator, have become a 2719
debt that has become worthless or uncollectable for a period of 2720
six months or more, and may be claimed as a deduction, including 2721
a deduction claimed if the owner or operator keeps accounts on 2722
an accrual basis, under the "Internal Revenue Code of 1954," 68A 2723
Stat. 50, 26 U.S.C. 166, as amended, and regulations adopted 2724
under it. Prior to making a request for a refund or credit, an 2725
owner or operator shall make reasonable efforts to collect the 2726
applicable fees. A request for a refund or credit shall not 2727
include any costs resulting from those efforts to collect unpaid 2728
fees. 2729
A request for a refund or credit of fees shall be made in 2730
writing, on a form prescribed by the director, and shall be 2731
supported by evidence that may be required in rules adopted by 2732
the director under this chapter. After reviewing the request, 2733
and if the request and evidence submitted with the request 2734
indicate that a refund or credit is warranted, the director 2735
shall grant a refund to the owner or operator or shall permit a 2736
credit to be taken by the owner or operator on a subsequent 2737
S. B. No. 147 Page 92
As Introduced
monthly return submitted by the owner or operator. The amount of 2738
a refund or credit shall not exceed an amount that is equal to 2739
ninety days' worth of fees owed to an owner or operator by a 2740
particular debtor of the owner or operator. A refund or credit 2741
shall not be granted by the director to an owner or operator 2742
more than once in any twelve-month period for fees owed to the 2743
owner or operator by a particular debtor. 2744
If, after receiving a refund or credit from the director, 2745
an owner or operator receives payment of all or part of the 2746
fees, the owner or operator shall remit the fees with the next 2747
monthly return submitted to the director together with a written 2748
explanation of the reason for the submittal. 2749
For purposes of computing the fees levied under this 2750
division or division (B) of this section, any solid waste 2751
transfer or disposal facility that does not use scales as a 2752
means of determining gate receipts shall use a conversion factor 2753
of three cubic yards per ton of solid waste or one cubic yard 2754
per ton for baled waste, as applicable. 2755
The fees levied under this division and divisions (B) and 2756
(C) of this section are in addition to all other applicable fees 2757
and taxes and shall be paid by the customer or a political 2758
subdivision to the owner or operator of a solid waste transfer 2759
or disposal facility. In the alternative, the fees shall be paid 2760
by a customer or political subdivision to a transporter of waste 2761
who subsequently transfers the fees to the owner or operator of 2762
such a facility. The fees shall be paid notwithstanding the 2763
existence of any provision in a contract that the customer or a 2764
political subdivision may have with the owner or operator or 2765
with a transporter of waste to the facility that would not 2766
require or allow such payment regardless of whether the contract 2767
S. B. No. 147 Page 93
As Introduced
was entered prior to or after October 16, 2009. For those 2768
purposes, "customer" means a person who contracts with, or 2769
utilizes the solid waste services of, the owner or operator of a 2770
solid waste transfer or disposal facility or a transporter of 2771
solid waste to such a facility. 2772
(B) For the purposes specified in division (G) of this 2773

Section 113:
section, the solid waste management policy committee of a county 2774
or joint solid waste management district may levy fees upon the 2775
following activities: 2776
(1) The disposal at a solid waste disposal facility 2777
located in the district of solid wastes generated within the 2778
district; 2779
(2) The disposal at a solid waste disposal facility within 2780
the district of solid wastes generated outside the boundaries of 2781
the district, but inside this state; 2782
(3) The disposal at a solid waste disposal facility within 2783
the district of solid wastes generated outside the boundaries of 2784
this state. 2785
The solid waste management plan of the county or joint 2786
district approved under section 3734.521 or 3734.55 of the 2787
Revised Code and any amendments to it, or the resolution adopted 2788
under this division, as appropriate, shall establish the rates 2789
of the fees levied under divisions (B)(1), (2), and (3) of this 2790

Section 114:
section, if any, and shall specify whether the fees are levied 2791
on the basis of tons or cubic yards as the unit of measurement. 2792
A solid waste management district that levies fees under this 2793
division on the basis of cubic yards shall do so in accordance 2794
with division (A) of this section. 2795
The fee levied under division (B)(1) of this section shall 2796
S. B. No. 147 Page 94

be not less than one dollar per ton nor more than two dollars 2797
per ton, the fee levied under division (B)(2) of this section 2798
shall be not less than two dollars per ton nor more than four 2799
dollars per ton, and the fee levied under division (B)(3) of 2800
this section shall be not more than the fee levied under 2801
division (B)(1) of this section. 2802
Prior to the approval of the solid waste management plan 2803
of a district under section 3734.55 of the Revised Code, the 2804
solid waste management policy committee of a district may levy 2805
fees under this division by adopting a resolution establishing 2806
the proposed amount of the fees. Upon adopting the resolution, 2807
the committee shall deliver a copy of the resolution to the 2808
board of county commissioners of each county forming the 2809
district and to the legislative authority of each municipal 2810
corporation and township under the jurisdiction of the district 2811
and shall prepare and publish the resolution and a notice of the 2812
time and location where a public hearing on the fees will be 2813
held. Upon adopting the resolution, the committee shall deliver 2814
written notice of the adoption of the resolution; of the amount 2815
of the proposed fees; and of the date, time, and location of the 2816
public hearing to the director and to the fifty industrial, 2817
commercial, or institutional generators of solid wastes within 2818
the district that generate the largest quantities of solid 2819
wastes, as determined by the committee, and to their local trade 2820
associations. The committee shall make good faith efforts to 2821
identify those generators within the district and their local 2822
trade associations, but the nonprovision of notice under this 2823
division to a particular generator or local trade association 2824
does not invalidate the proceedings under this division. The 2825
publication shall occur at least thirty days before the hearing. 2826
After the hearing, the committee may make such revisions to the 2827
S. B. No. 147 Page 95
As Introduced
proposed fees as it considers appropriate and thereafter, by 2828
resolution, shall adopt the revised fee schedule. Upon adopting 2829
the revised fee schedule, the committee shall deliver a copy of 2830
the resolution doing so to the board of county commissioners of 2831
each county forming the district and to the legislative 2832
authority of each municipal corporation and township under the 2833
jurisdiction of the district. Within sixty days after the 2834
delivery of a copy of the resolution adopting the proposed 2835
revised fees by the policy committee, each such board and 2836
legislative authority, by ordinance or resolution, shall approve 2837
or disapprove the revised fees and deliver a copy of the 2838
ordinance or resolution to the committee. If any such board or 2839
legislative authority fails to adopt and deliver to the policy 2840
committee an ordinance or resolution approving or disapproving 2841
the revised fees within sixty days after the policy committee 2842
delivered its resolution adopting the proposed revised fees, it 2843
shall be conclusively presumed that the board or legislative 2844
authority has approved the proposed revised fees. The committee 2845
shall determine if the resolution has been ratified in the same 2846
manner in which it determines if a draft solid waste management 2847
plan has been ratified under division (B) of section 3734.55 of 2848
the Revised Code. 2849
The committee may amend the schedule of fees levied 2850
pursuant to a resolution adopted and ratified under this 2851
division by adopting a resolution establishing the proposed 2852
amount of the amended fees. The committee may repeal the fees 2853
levied pursuant to such a resolution by adopting a resolution 2854
proposing to repeal them. Upon adopting such a resolution, the 2855
committee shall proceed to obtain ratification of the resolution 2856
in accordance with this division. 2857
Not later than fourteen days after declaring the new fees 2858
S. B. No. 147 Page 96

to be ratified or the fees to be repealed under this division, 2859
the committee shall notify by certified mail the owner or 2860
operator of each solid waste disposal facility that is required 2861
to collect the fees of the ratification and the amount of the 2862
fees or of the repeal of the fees. Collection of any fees shall 2863
commence or collection of repealed fees shall cease on the first 2864
day of the second month following the month in which 2865
notification is sent to the owner or operator. 2866
Fees levied under this division also may be established, 2867
amended, or repealed by a solid waste management policy 2868
committee through the adoption of a new district solid waste 2869
management plan, the adoption of an amended plan, or the 2870
amendment of the plan or amended plan in accordance with 2871

Section 115:

or amendment of a district plan in connection with a change in 2873
district composition under section 3734.521 of the Revised Code. 2874
Not later than fourteen days after the director issues an 2875
order approving a district's solid waste management plan, 2876
amended plan, or amendment to a plan or amended plan that 2877
establishes, amends, or repeals a schedule of fees levied by the 2878
district, the committee shall notify by certified mail the owner 2879

board of directors of a district that is levying fees under 3330
division (A) or (B) of this section shall submit to the director 3331
a proposed budget for the expenditure of moneys from the special 3332
fund of the district created under division (G) of section 3333

Section 133:
3734.57 of the Revised Code. The proposed budget shall be 3334
submitted on a form prescribed by the director. 3335
The director may disapprove in whole or in part such a 3336
proposed quarterly budget for any of the following reasons: 3337
(1) The proposed budget includes expenditures for any 3338
purpose other than those authorized under divisions (G)(1) to 3339
(10)division (G) of section 3734.57 of the Revised Code; 3340
(2) The director reasonably estimates that there will be 3341
insufficient moneys in the special fund created to meet the 3342
proposed expenditures; 3343
(3) The board failed to submit the proposed budget to the 3344
S. B. No. 147 Page 112
As Introduced
director at least thirty days prior to the beginning of the 3345
calendar quarter to which it pertains; 3346
(4) The board failed to submit the latest report of 3347
quarterly expenditures from the fund that it was required to 3348
submit under section 3734.575 of the Revised Code within thirty 3349
days after the end of the calendar quarter to which it pertains; 3350
(5) The district is materially failing to comply with the 3351
implementation schedule contained in the plan or amended plan of 3352
the district prepared and ordered to be implemented under 3353

Section 134:
section 3734.521, 3734.55, or 3734.56 of the Revised Code; 3354
(6) There have been repeated inconsistencies between the 3355
expenditures projected in the proposed budgets submitted under 3356
division (E) of this section and actual expenditures from the 3357
fund. 3358
If the director does not disapprove a proposed quarterly 3359
budget prior to the first day of the calendar quarter to which 3360
it pertains, it is conclusively presumed that the proposed 3361
budget has not been disapproved. 3362
Nothing in division (E) of this section precludes the 3363

BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF OHIO:
Section 1. That sections 343.01, 343.011, 343.012, 10
343.022, 343.08, 3714.07, 3714.073, 3734.521, 3734.53, 3734.56, 11
3734.57, and 3734.574 be amended and section 3734.522 of the 12
Revised Code be enacted to read as follows: 13
Sec. 343.01. (A) In order to comply with division (B) of 14
section 3734.52 of the Revised Code, the board of county 15
commissioners of each county shall do one of the following: 16
(1) Establish, by resolution, and maintain a county solid 17
waste management district under this chapter that consists of 18
all the incorporated and unincorporated territory within the 19
county except as otherwise provided in division (A) of this 20

S. B. No. 147 Page 2
As Introduced
section; 21
(2) With the boards of county commissioners of one or more 22
other counties establish, by agreement, and maintain a joint 23
solid waste management district under this chapter that consists 24
of all the incorporated and unincorporated territory within the 25
counties forming the joint district except as otherwise provided 26
in division (A) of this section. 27
If a municipal corporation is located in more than one 28
solid waste management district, the entire municipal 29
corporation shall be considered to be included in and shall be 30
under the jurisdiction of the district in which a majority of 31
the population of the municipal corporation resides. 32
A county and joint district established to comply with 33
division (B) of section 3734.52 of the Revised Code shall have a 34
population of not less than one hundred twenty thousand unless, 35
in the instance of a county district, the board of county 36
commissioners has obtained an exemption from that requirement 37
under division (C)(1) or (2) of that section. Each joint 38
district established to comply with an order issued under 39
division (D) of that section shall have a population of at least 40
one hundred twenty thousand. 41
(B) The boards of county commissioners of the counties 42
establishing a joint district constitute, collectively, the 43
board of directors of the joint district, except that if a 44
county with a form of legislative authority other than a board 45
of county commissioners participates, it shall be represented on 46
the board of directors by three persons appointed by the 47
legislative authority. 48
The agreement to establish and maintain a joint district 49

S. B. No. 147 Page 3
As Introduced
shall be ratified by resolution of the board of county 50
commissioners of each participating county. Upon ratification, 51
the board of directors shall take control of and manage the 52
joint district subject to this chapter, except that, in the case 53
of a joint district formed pursuant to division (C)(B), (D)(C), 54
or (E) (D) of section 343.012 of the Revised Code, the board of 55
directors shall take control of and manage the district when the 56
formation of the district becomes final under the applicable 57
division. A majority of the board of directors constitutes a 58
quorum, and a majority vote is required for the board to act. 59
A county participating in a joint district may contribute 60
lands or rights or interests therein, money, other personal 61
property or rights or interests therein, or services to the 62
district. The agreement shall specify any contributions of 63
participating counties and the rights of the participating 64
counties in lands or personal property, or rights or interests 65
therein, contributed to or otherwise acquired by the joint 66
district. The agreement may be amended or added to by a majority 67
vote of the board of directors, but no amendment or addition 68
shall divest a participating county of any right or interest in 69
lands or personal property without its consent. 70
The board of directors may appoint and fix the 71
compensation of employees of, accept gifts, devises, and 72
bequests for, and take other actions necessary to control and 73
manage the joint district. Employees of the district shall be 74
considered county employees for the purposes of Chapter 124. of 75
the Revised Code and other provisions of state law applicable to 76
employees. Instead of or in addition to appointing employees of 77
the district, the board of directors may agree to use employees 78
of one or more of the participating counties in the service of 79
the joint district and to share in their compensation in any 80

S. B. No. 147 Page 4
As Introduced
manner that may be agreed upon. 81
The board of directors shall do one of the following: 82
(1) Designate the county auditor, including any other 83
official acting in a capacity similar to a county auditor under 84
a county charter, of a county participating in the joint 85
district as the fiscal officer of the district, and the county 86
treasurer, or other official acting in a capacity similar to a 87
county treasurer under a county charter, of that county as the 88
treasurer of the district. The designated county officials shall 89
perform any applicable duties for the district as each typically 90
performs for the county of which the individual is an official, 91
except as otherwise may be provided in any bylaws or resolutions 92
adopted by the board of directors. The board of directors may 93
pay to that county any amount agreed upon by the board of 94
directors and the board of county commissioners of that county 95
to reimburse that county for the cost properly allocable to the 96
service of its officials as fiscal officer and treasurer of the 97
joint district. 98
(2) Appoint one individual who is neither a county auditor 99
nor a county treasurer, and who may be an employee of the 100
district, to serve as both the treasurer of the district and its 101
fiscal officer. That individual shall act as custodian of the 102
funds of the board and the district and shall maintain all 103
accounts of the district. Any reference in this chapter or 104
Chapter 3734. of the Revised Code to a county auditor or county 105
treasurer serving as fiscal officer of a district or custodian 106
of any funds of a board or district is deemed to refer to an 107
individual appointed under division (B)(2) of this section. 108
The fiscal officer of a district shall establish a general 109
fund and any other necessary funds for the district. 110

S. B. No. 147 Page 5
As Introduced
(C) A board of county commissioners of a county district 111
or board of directors of a joint district may acquire, by 112
purchase or lease, construct, improve, enlarge, replace, 113
maintain, and operate such solid waste collection systems within 114
their respective districts and such solid waste facilities 115
within or outside their respective districts as are necessary 116
for the protection of the public health. A board of county 117
commissioners may acquire within its county real property or any 118
estate, interest, or right therein, by appropriation or any 119
other method, for use by a county or joint district in 120
connection with such facilities. Appropriation proceedings shall 121
be conducted in accordance with sections 163.01 to 163.22 of the 122
Revised Code. 123
(D) The sanitary engineer or sanitary engineering 124
department of a county maintaining a district and any sanitary 125
engineer or sanitary engineering department of a county in a 126
joint district, as determined by the board of directors, in 127
addition to other duties assigned to that engineer or 128
department, shall assist the board of county commissioners or 129
directors in the performance of their duties under this chapter 130
and sections 3734.52 to 3734.575 of the Revised Code and shall 131
be charged with any other duties and services in relation 132
thereto that the board prescribes. A board may employ registered 133
professional engineers to assist the sanitary engineer in those 134
duties and also may employ financial advisers and any other 135
professional services it considers necessary to assist it in the 136
construction, financing, and maintenance of solid waste 137
collection or other solid waste facilities. Such contracts of 138
employment shall not require the certificate provided in section 139
5705.41 of the Revised Code. Payment for such services may be 140
made from the general fund or any other fund legally available 141

S. B. No. 147 Page 6
As Introduced
for that use at times that are agreed upon or as determined by 142
the board of county commissioners or directors, and the funds 143
may be reimbursed from the proceeds of bonds or notes issued to 144
pay the cost of any improvement to which the services related. 145
(E)(1) The prosecuting attorney of the county shall serve 146
as the legal advisor of a county district and shall provide such 147
services to the board of county commissioners of the district as 148
are required or authorized to be provided to other county boards 149
under Chapter 309. of the Revised Code, except that, if the 150
board considers it to be necessary or appropriate, the board, on 151
its own initiative, may employ an attorney or other legal 152
counsel on an annual basis to serve as the legal advisor of the 153
district in place of the prosecuting attorney. When the 154
prosecuting attorney is serving as the district's legal advisor 155
and the board considers it to be necessary or appropriate, the 156
board, on its own initiative, may employ an attorney or other 157
legal counsel to represent or advise the board regarding a 158
particular matter in place of the prosecuting attorney. The 159
employment of an attorney or other legal counsel on an annual 160
basis or in a particular matter is not subject to or governed by 161
sections 305.14 and 309.09 of the Revised Code. 162
Notwithstanding the employment of an attorney or other 163
legal counsel on an annual basis to serve as the district's 164
legal advisor, the board may require written opinions or 165
instructions from the prosecuting attorney under section 309.09 166
of the Revised Code in matters connected with its official 167
duties as though the prosecuting attorney were serving as the 168
legal advisor of the district. 169
(2) The board of directors of a joint district may 170
designate the prosecuting attorney of one of the counties 171

S. B. No. 147 Page 7
As Introduced
forming the district to serve as the legal advisor of the 172
district. When so designated, the prosecuting attorney shall 173
provide such services to the joint district as are required or 174
authorized to be provided to county boards under Chapter 309. of 175
the Revised Code. The board of directors may pay to that county 176
any amount agreed upon by the board of directors and the board 177
of county commissioners of that county to reimburse that county 178
for the cost properly allocable to the services of its 179
prosecuting attorney as the legal advisor of the joint district. 180
When that prosecuting attorney is so serving and the board 181
considers it to be necessary or appropriate, the board, on its 182
own initiative, may employ an attorney or other legal counsel to 183
represent or advise the board regarding a particular matter in 184
place of the prosecuting attorney. 185
Instead of designating the prosecuting attorney of one of 186
the counties forming the district to be the legal advisor of the 187
district, the board of directors may employ on an annual basis 188
an attorney or other legal counsel to serve as the district's 189
legal advisor. Notwithstanding the employment of an attorney or 190
other legal counsel as the district's legal advisor, the board 191
of directors may require written opinions or instructions from 192
the prosecuting attorney of any of the counties forming the 193
district in matters connected with the board's official duties, 194
and the prosecuting attorney shall provide the written opinion 195
or instructions as though the prosecuting attorney had been 196
designated to serve as the district's legal advisor under 197
division (E)(2) of this section. 198
(F) A board of county commissioners may issue bonds or 199
bond anticipation notes of the county to pay the cost of 200
preparing general and detailed plans and other data required for 201
the construction of solid waste facilities in connection with a 202

county or joint district. A board of directors of a joint solid 203
waste management district may issue bonds or bond anticipation 204
notes of the joint solid waste management district to pay the 205
cost of preparing general and detailed plans and other data 206
required for the construction of solid waste facilities in 207
connection with a joint district. The bonds and notes shall be 208
issued in accordance with Chapter 133. of the Revised Code, 209
except that the maximum maturity of bonds issued for that 210
purpose shall not exceed ten years. Bond anticipation notes may 211
be paid from the proceeds of bonds issued either to pay the cost 212
of the solid waste facilities or to pay the cost of the plans 213
and other data. 214
(G) To the extent authorized by the solid waste management 215
plan of the district approved under section 3734.521 or 3734.55 216
of the Revised Code or subsequent amended plans of the district 217
approved under section 3734.521 or 3734.56 of the Revised Code, 218
the board of county commissioners of a county district or board 219
of directors of a joint district may adopt, publish, and enforce 220
rules doing any of the following: 221
(1) Prohibiting or limiting the receipt of solid wastes 222
generated outside the district or outside a service area 223
prescribed in the solid waste management plan or amended plan, 224
at facilities located within the solid waste management 225
district, consistent with the projections contained in the plan 226
or amended plan under divisions (A)(6) and (7) of section 227
3734.53 of the Revised Code. However, rules adopted by a board 228
under division (G)(1) of this section may be adopted and 229
enforced with respect to solid waste disposal facilities in the 230
solid waste management district that are not owned by a county 231
or the solid waste management district only if the board submits 232
an application to the director of environmental protection that 233

S. B. No. 147 Page 9
As Introduced
demonstrates that there is insufficient capacity to dispose of 234
all solid wastes that are generated within the district at the 235
solid waste disposal facilities located within the district and 236
the director approves the application. The demonstration in the 237
application shall be based on projections contained in the plan 238
or amended plan of the district. The director shall establish 239
the form of the application. The approval or disapproval of such 240
an application by the director is an action that is appealable 241
under section 3745.04 of the Revised Code. 242
In addition, the director of environmental protection may 243
issue an order modifying a rule adopted under division (G)(1) of 244
this section to allow the disposal in the district of solid 245
wastes from another county or joint solid waste management 246
district if all of the following apply: 247
(a) The district in which the wastes were generated does 248
not have sufficient capacity to dispose of solid wastes 249
generated within it for six months following the date of the 250
director's order. 251
(b) No new solid waste facilities will begin operation 252
during those six months in the district in which the wastes were 253
generated and, despite good faith efforts to do so, it is 254
impossible to site new solid waste facilities within the 255
district because of its high population density. 256
(c) The district in which the wastes were generated has 257
made good faith efforts to negotiate with other districts to 258
incorporate its disposal needs within those districts' solid 259
waste management plans, including efforts to develop joint 260
facilities authorized under section 343.02 of the Revised Code, 261
and the efforts have been unsuccessful. 262

S. B. No. 147 Page 10
As Introduced
(d) The district in which the wastes were generated has 263
located a facility willing to accept the district's solid wastes 264
for disposal within the receiving district. 265
(e) The district in which the wastes were generated has 266
demonstrated to the director that the conditions specified in 267
divisions (G)(1)(a) to (d) of this section have been met. 268
(f) The director finds that the issuance of the order will 269
be consistent with the state solid waste management plan and 270
that receipt of the out-of-district wastes will not limit the 271
capacity of the receiving district to dispose of its in-district 272
wastes to less than eight years. 273
Any order issued under division (G)(1) of this section 274
shall not become final until thirty days after it has been 275
served upon the county or joint solid waste management district 276
that will receive the out-of-district wastes either by certified 277
mail or, if the director has record of an internet identifier of 278
record associated with the district, by ordinary mail and by 279
that internet identifier of record. 280
(2) Governing the maintenance, protection, and use of 281
solid waste collection or other solid waste facilities located 282
within its district. The rules adopted under division (G)(2) of 283
this section shall not establish design standards for solid 284
waste facilities and shall be consistent with the solid waste 285
provisions of Chapter 3734. of the Revised Code and the rules 286
adopted under those provisions. The rules adopted under division 287
(G)(2) of this section may prohibit any person, municipal 288
corporation, township, or other political subdivision from 289
constructing, enlarging, or modifying any solid waste facility 290
until general plans and specifications for the proposed 291
improvement have been submitted to and approved by the board of 292

S. B. No. 147 Page 11
As Introduced
county commissioners or board of directors as complying with the 293
solid waste management plan or amended plan of the district. The 294
construction of such a facility shall be done under the 295
supervision of the county sanitary engineer or, in the case of a 296
joint district, a county sanitary engineer designated by the 297
board of directors, and any person, municipal corporation, 298
township, or other political subdivision proposing or 299
constructing such improvements shall pay to the county or joint 300
district all expenses incurred by the board in connection 301
therewith. The sanitary engineer may enter upon any public or 302
private property for the purpose of making surveys or 303
examinations necessary for designing solid waste facilities or 304
for supervising the construction, enlargement, modification, or 305
operation of any such facilities. No person, municipal 306
corporation, township, or other political subdivision shall 307
forbid or interfere with the sanitary engineer or the sanitary 308
engineer's authorized assistants entering upon such property for 309
that purpose. If actual damage is done to property by the making 310
of the surveys and examinations, a board shall pay the 311
reasonable value of that damage to the owner of the property 312
damaged, and the cost shall be included in the financing of the 313
improvement for which the surveys and examinations are made. 314
(3) Governing the development and implementation of a 315
program for the inspection of solid wastes generated outside the 316
boundaries of this state that are disposed of at solid waste 317
facilities included in the district's solid waste management 318
plan or amended plan. A board of county commissioners or board 319
of directors or its authorized representative may enter upon the 320
premises of any solid waste facility included in the district's 321
solid waste management plan or amended plan for the purpose of 322
conducting the inspections required or authorized by the rules 323

S. B. No. 147 Page 12

adopted under division (G)(3) of this section. No person, 324
municipal corporation, township, or other political subdivision 325
shall forbid or interfere with a board of county commissioners 326
or directors or its authorized representative entering upon the 327
premises of any such solid waste facility for that purpose. 328
(4) Exempting the owner or operator of any existing or 329
proposed solid waste facility provided for in the plan or 330
amended plan from compliance with any amendment to a township 331
zoning resolution adopted under section 519.12 of the Revised 332
Code or to a county rural zoning resolution adopted under 333
section 303.12 of the Revised Code that rezoned or redistricted 334
the parcel or parcels upon which the facility is to be 335
constructed or modified and that became effective within two 336
years prior to the filing of an application for a permit 337
required under division (A)(2)(a) of section 3734.05 of the 338
Revised Code to open a new or modify an existing solid waste 339
facility. 340
(H) A board of county commissioners or board of directors 341
may enter into a contract with any person, municipal 342
corporation, township, or other political subdivision for the 343
operation and maintenance of any solid waste facilities 344
regardless of whether the facilities are owned or leased by the 345
county or joint district or the contractor. 346
(I)(1) No person, municipal corporation, township, or 347
other political subdivision shall tamper with or damage any 348
solid waste facility constructed under this chapter or any 349
apparatus or accessory connected therewith or pertaining 350
thereto, fail or refuse to comply with the applicable rules 351
adopted by a board of county commissioners or directors under 352
division (G)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section, refuse to 353

S. B. No. 147 Page 13

permit an inspection or examination by a sanitary engineer as 354
authorized under division (G)(2) of this section, or refuse to 355
permit an inspection by a board of county commissioners or 356
directors or its authorized representative as required or 357
authorized by rules adopted under division (G)(3) of this 358
section. 359
(2) If the board of county commissioners of a county 360
district or board of directors of a joint district has 361
established facility designations under section 343.013, 362
343.014, or 343.015 of the Revised Code, or the director has 363
established facility designations in the initial or amended plan 364
of the district prepared and ordered to be implemented under 365
section 3734.521, 3734.55, or 3734.56 of the Revised Code, no 366
person, municipal corporation, township, or other political 367
subdivision shall deliver, or cause the delivery of, any solid 368
wastes generated within a county or joint district to any solid 369
waste facility other than the facility designated under section 370
343.013, 343.014, or 343.015 of the Revised Code, or in the 371
initial or amended plan of the district prepared and ordered to 372
be implemented under section 3734.521, 3734.55, or 3734.56 of 373
the Revised Code, as applicable, except that source separated 374
recyclable materials may be taken to any legitimate recycling 375
facility. Upon the request of a person or the legislative 376
authority of a municipal corporation or township, the board of 377
county commissioners of a county district or board of directors 378
of a joint district may grant a waiver authorizing the delivery 379
of all or any portion of the solid wastes generated in a 380
municipal corporation or township to a solid waste facility 381

own initiative, may employ an attorney or other legal counsel to 726
advise the board regarding a particular matter in place of the 727
prosecuting attorney. 728
Instead of designating the prosecuting attorney of the 729

instructions from the prosecuting attorney of the county or, in 737
the case of a joint district, any of the counties forming the 738
district in matters connected with the board's official duties, 739
and the prosecuting attorney shall provide the written opinion 740
or instructions as though he the prosecuting attorney had been 741
designated to serve as the authority's legal advisor under this 742
division. 743

interest through affiliation with a waste management company or 748
with any entity that is a significant generator of solid wastes 749
shall be added to the board of trustees of a regional authority 750
formed in a county district. In the case of a regional authority 751
formed in a joint district, one member shall be added to the 752
board of trustees from each county that is a member of the joint 753
district to represent industrial, commercial, or institutional 754
generators of solid wastes within the county, and one member 755
shall be added to the board from each such county to represent 756
the general interests of citizens who shall have no conflict of 757
interest through affiliation with a waste management company or 758
with any entity that is a significant generator of solid wastes. 759
The members representing generators and the general interests of 760
citizens shall be added to the board of trustees without the 761
necessity for amending the agreement to form the regional 762
authority. They shall be appointed in the same manner as the 763
public member of the board is required to be appointed under 764
this section and shall serve for terms of the same length as the 765
other members, as provided in the agreement. 766

resolution of disapproval, the board of directors shall declare 796
the proposed withdrawal to be disapproved and shall deliver 797
written notice of the disapproval to the boards of county 798
commissioners of the affected counties. If all of the other 799
boards of county commissioners adopt a resolution approving the 800
proposed withdrawal, the board of directors shall declare the 801
withdrawal to be approved and shall deliver written notice of 802
the approval to the boards of county commissioners of the 803
affected counties. The board of directors shall determine 804

(B) A board of county commissioners or directors may adopt 1316
a cost allocation plan that identifies, accumulates, and 1317
distributes allowable direct and indirect costs that may be paid 1318
from the fund of the district created in division (A) of this 1319
section and prescribes methods for allocating those costs. The 1320
plan shall authorize payment from the fund for only those costs 1321
incurred by the district, the sanitary engineer or sanitary 1322

if any, that is required to submit a preliminary demonstration 1898
of capacity under division (E)(1) or (2) of this section fails 1899
to obtain approval of its plan or amended plan within thirty- 1900
eight months after the submission of its preliminary 1901
demonstration of capacity, the director shall determine what 1902
actions are necessary to ensure that each county involved in the 1903
proposed change will be included in a district that either will 1904
have within its boundaries sufficient solid waste management 1905
facility capacity to provide for the disposal of all of the 1906
solid wastes generated within its boundaries during the 1907
subsequent ten-year period or will have access to sufficient 1908
capacity at facilities located outside the district or this 1909
state by contract or agreement to dispose of all of the solid 1910
wastes generated within the district during that ten-year 1911
period. Based upon that determination, the director shall do 1912
either of the following, as appropriate: 1913
(1) If the director determines that the solid waste 1914
management needs of each of the counties involved can be met if 1915
the proposed change were to occur, he shall prepare an initial 1916
or amended plan that complies with divisions (A) and (D) of 1917
section 3734.53 of the Revised Code for each of the proposed or 1918
existing districts that failed to obtain approval of its plan or 1919
amended plan within thirty-eight months after the districts were 1920
required to submit their preliminary demonstrations of capacity 1921
under division (E)(1) or (2) of this section. None of the plans 1922
or amended plans prepared by the director shall contain any of 1923
the provisions required or authorized to be included in plans 1924
submitted by districts under division (B), (C), or (E) of 1925
section 3734.53 of the Revised Code. Upon completion of each 1926
such plan or amended plan, the director shall issue an order in 1927
accordance with Chapter 3745. of the Revised Code directing the 1928

board of county commissioners or directors of the district for 1929
which the plan or amended plan was prepared to implement it in 1930
compliance with the implementation schedule contained in it. 1931
(2) If the director determines that the solid waste 1932
management needs of each of the counties involved cannot be met 1933
if the proposed change in district composition were to occur, he 1934
shall make a determination as to how county or joint districts 1935
should be formed from among those counties to ensure that each 1936
will be included in a district that either will have within its 1937
boundaries sufficient solid waste management facility capacity 1938
to provide for the disposal of all the solid wastes generated 1939
within the district during the subsequent ten-year period or 1940
will have access to sufficient capacity at facilities located 1941
outside the district or this state by contract or agreement to 1942
dispose of all the solid wastes generated within the district 1943
during that ten-year period. After making his determination, the 1944
director shall prepare an initial or amended solid waste 1945
management plan for each of them. If the director determines 1946
that any existing district involved in the proposed change 1947
should be retained without a modification in its composition, 1948
the director shall prepare an amended plan for the district. The 1949
director shall prepare an initial or amended plan for each 1950
district whose composition would be changed under his 1951
determination. Each such plan or amended plan shall comply with 1952
divisions (A) and (D) of section 3734.53 of the Revised Code. 1953

provisions required or authorized to be included in plans under 1955
division (B), (C), or (E) of that section. 1956
If a plan prepared under this division provides for the 1957
establishment of a joint district by two or more counties that 1958
had each previously formed a county district, the director, in 1959

In the case of solid wastes that are taken to a solid 2653
waste transfer facility located in this state prior to being 2654
transported for disposal at a solid waste disposal facility 2655
located in this state or outside of this state, the fees levied 2656
under this division shall be collected by the owner or operator 2657
of the transfer facility as a trustee for the state. The amount 2658
of fees required to be collected under this division at such a 2659
transfer facility shall equal the total tonnage of solid wastes 2660
received at the facility multiplied by the fees levied under 2661
this division. In the case of solid wastes that are not taken to 2662
a solid waste transfer facility located in this state prior to 2663
being transported to a solid waste disposal facility, the fees 2664
shall be collected by the owner or operator of the solid waste 2665
disposal facility as a trustee for the state. The amount of fees 2666
required to be collected under this division at such a disposal 2667
facility shall equal the total tonnage of solid wastes received 2668
at the facility that was not previously taken to a solid waste 2669
transfer facility located in this state multiplied by the fees 2670
levied under this division. Fees levied under this division do 2671
not apply to materials separated from a mixed waste stream for 2672
recycling by a generator or materials removed from the solid 2673
waste stream through recycling, as "recycling" is defined in 2674
rules adopted under section 3734.02 of the Revised Code. 2675

S. B. No. 147 Page 90
As Introduced
The owner or operator of a solid waste transfer facility 2676
or disposal facility, as applicable, shall prepare and file with 2677
the director of environmental protection each month a return 2678
indicating the total tonnage of solid wastes received at the 2679
facility during that month and the total amount of the fees 2680
required to be collected under this division during that month. 2681
In addition, the owner or operator of a solid waste disposal 2682
facility shall indicate on the return the total tonnage of solid 2683
wastes received from transfer facilities located in this state 2684
during that month for which the fees were required to be 2685
collected by the transfer facilities. The monthly returns shall 2686
be filed on a form prescribed by the director. Not later than 2687
thirty days after the last day of the month to which a return 2688
applies, the owner or operator shall mail to the director the 2689
return for that month together with the fees required to be 2690
collected under this division during that month as indicated on 2691
the return or may submit the return and fees electronically in a 2692
manner approved by the director. If the return is filed and the 2693
amount of the fees due is paid in a timely manner as required in 2694
this division, the owner or operator may retain a discount of 2695
three-fourths of one per cent of the total amount of the fees 2696
that are required to be paid as indicated on the return. 2697
The owner or operator may request an extension of not more 2698
than thirty days for filing the return and remitting the fees, 2699
provided that the owner or operator has submitted such a request 2700
in writing to the director together with a detailed description 2701
of why the extension is requested, the director has received the 2702
request not later than the day on which the return is required 2703
to be filed, and the director has approved the request. If the 2704
fees are not remitted within thirty days after the last day of 2705
the month to which the return applies or are not remitted by the 2706

S. B. No. 147 Page 91
As Introduced
last day of an extension approved by the director, the owner or 2707
operator shall not retain the three-fourths of one per cent 2708
discount and shall pay an additional ten per cent of the amount 2709
of the fees for each month that they are late. For purposes of 2710
calculating the late fee, the first month in which fees are late 2711
begins on the first day after the deadline has passed for timely 2712
submitting the return and fees, and one additional month shall 2713
be counted every thirty days thereafter. 2714
The owner or operator of a solid waste facility may 2715
request a refund or credit of fees levied under this division 2716
and remitted to the director that have not been paid to the 2717
owner or operator. Such a request shall be made only if the fees 2718
have not been collected by the owner or operator, have become a 2719
debt that has become worthless or uncollectable for a period of 2720
six months or more, and may be claimed as a deduction, including 2721
a deduction claimed if the owner or operator keeps accounts on 2722
an accrual basis, under the "Internal Revenue Code of 1954," 68A 2723
Stat. 50, 26 U.S.C. 166, as amended, and regulations adopted 2724
under it. Prior to making a request for a refund or credit, an 2725
owner or operator shall make reasonable efforts to collect the 2726
applicable fees. A request for a refund or credit shall not 2727
include any costs resulting from those efforts to collect unpaid 2728
fees. 2729
A request for a refund or credit of fees shall be made in 2730
writing, on a form prescribed by the director, and shall be 2731
supported by evidence that may be required in rules adopted by 2732
the director under this chapter. After reviewing the request, 2733
and if the request and evidence submitted with the request 2734
indicate that a refund or credit is warranted, the director 2735
shall grant a refund to the owner or operator or shall permit a 2736
credit to be taken by the owner or operator on a subsequent 2737

S. B. No. 147 Page 92
As Introduced
monthly return submitted by the owner or operator. The amount of 2738
a refund or credit shall not exceed an amount that is equal to 2739
ninety days' worth of fees owed to an owner or operator by a 2740
particular debtor of the owner or operator. A refund or credit 2741
shall not be granted by the director to an owner or operator 2742
more than once in any twelve-month period for fees owed to the 2743
owner or operator by a particular debtor. 2744
If, after receiving a refund or credit from the director, 2745
an owner or operator receives payment of all or part of the 2746
fees, the owner or operator shall remit the fees with the next 2747
monthly return submitted to the director together with a written 2748
explanation of the reason for the submittal. 2749
For purposes of computing the fees levied under this 2750
division or division (B) of this section, any solid waste 2751
transfer or disposal facility that does not use scales as a 2752
means of determining gate receipts shall use a conversion factor 2753
of three cubic yards per ton of solid waste or one cubic yard 2754
per ton for baled waste, as applicable. 2755
The fees levied under this division and divisions (B) and 2756
(C) of this section are in addition to all other applicable fees 2757
and taxes and shall be paid by the customer or a political 2758
subdivision to the owner or operator of a solid waste transfer 2759
or disposal facility. In the alternative, the fees shall be paid 2760
by a customer or political subdivision to a transporter of waste 2761
who subsequently transfers the fees to the owner or operator of 2762
such a facility. The fees shall be paid notwithstanding the 2763
existence of any provision in a contract that the customer or a 2764
political subdivision may have with the owner or operator or 2765
with a transporter of waste to the facility that would not 2766
require or allow such payment regardless of whether the contract 2767

S. B. No. 147 Page 93
As Introduced
was entered prior to or after October 16, 2009. For those 2768
purposes, "customer" means a person who contracts with, or 2769
utilizes the solid waste services of, the owner or operator of a 2770
solid waste transfer or disposal facility or a transporter of 2771
solid waste to such a facility. 2772
(B) For the purposes specified in division (G) of this 2773
section, the solid waste management policy committee of a county 2774
or joint solid waste management district may levy fees upon the 2775
following activities: 2776
(1) The disposal at a solid waste disposal facility 2777
located in the district of solid wastes generated within the 2778
district; 2779
(2) The disposal at a solid waste disposal facility within 2780
the district of solid wastes generated outside the boundaries of 2781
the district, but inside this state; 2782
(3) The disposal at a solid waste disposal facility within 2783
the district of solid wastes generated outside the boundaries of 2784
this state. 2785
The solid waste management plan of the county or joint 2786
district approved under section 3734.521 or 3734.55 of the 2787
Revised Code and any amendments to it, or the resolution adopted 2788
under this division, as appropriate, shall establish the rates 2789
of the fees levied under divisions (B)(1), (2), and (3) of this 2790
section, if any, and shall specify whether the fees are levied 2791
on the basis of tons or cubic yards as the unit of measurement. 2792
A solid waste management district that levies fees under this 2793
division on the basis of cubic yards shall do so in accordance 2794
with division (A) of this section. 2795
The fee levied under division (B)(1) of this section shall 2796

S. B. No. 147 Page 94
As Introduced
be not less than one dollar per ton nor more than two dollars 2797
per ton, the fee levied under division (B)(2) of this section 2798
shall be not less than two dollars per ton nor more than four 2799
dollars per ton, and the fee levied under division (B)(3) of 2800
this section shall be not more than the fee levied under 2801
division (B)(1) of this section. 2802
Prior to the approval of the solid waste management plan 2803
of a district under section 3734.55 of the Revised Code, the 2804
solid waste management policy committee of a district may levy 2805
fees under this division by adopting a resolution establishing 2806
the proposed amount of the fees. Upon adopting the resolution, 2807
the committee shall deliver a copy of the resolution to the 2808
board of county commissioners of each county forming the 2809
district and to the legislative authority of each municipal 2810
corporation and township under the jurisdiction of the district 2811
and shall prepare and publish the resolution and a notice of the 2812
time and location where a public hearing on the fees will be 2813
held. Upon adopting the resolution, the committee shall deliver 2814
written notice of the adoption of the resolution; of the amount 2815
of the proposed fees; and of the date, time, and location of the 2816
public hearing to the director and to the fifty industrial, 2817
commercial, or institutional generators of solid wastes within 2818
the district that generate the largest quantities of solid 2819
wastes, as determined by the committee, and to their local trade 2820
associations. The committee shall make good faith efforts to 2821
identify those generators within the district and their local 2822
trade associations, but the nonprovision of notice under this 2823
division to a particular generator or local trade association 2824
does not invalidate the proceedings under this division. The 2825
publication shall occur at least thirty days before the hearing. 2826
After the hearing, the committee may make such revisions to the 2827

S. B. No. 147 Page 95
As Introduced
proposed fees as it considers appropriate and thereafter, by 2828
resolution, shall adopt the revised fee schedule. Upon adopting 2829
the revised fee schedule, the committee shall deliver a copy of 2830
the resolution doing so to the board of county commissioners of 2831
each county forming the district and to the legislative 2832
authority of each municipal corporation and township under the 2833
jurisdiction of the district. Within sixty days after the 2834
delivery of a copy of the resolution adopting the proposed 2835
revised fees by the policy committee, each such board and 2836
legislative authority, by ordinance or resolution, shall approve 2837
or disapprove the revised fees and deliver a copy of the 2838
ordinance or resolution to the committee. If any such board or 2839
legislative authority fails to adopt and deliver to the policy 2840
committee an ordinance or resolution approving or disapproving 2841
the revised fees within sixty days after the policy committee 2842
delivered its resolution adopting the proposed revised fees, it 2843
shall be conclusively presumed that the board or legislative 2844
authority has approved the proposed revised fees. The committee 2845
shall determine if the resolution has been ratified in the same 2846
manner in which it determines if a draft solid waste management 2847
plan has been ratified under division (B) of section 3734.55 of 2848
the Revised Code. 2849
The committee may amend the schedule of fees levied 2850
pursuant to a resolution adopted and ratified under this 2851
division by adopting a resolution establishing the proposed 2852
amount of the amended fees. The committee may repeal the fees 2853
levied pursuant to such a resolution by adopting a resolution 2854
proposing to repeal them. Upon adopting such a resolution, the 2855
committee shall proceed to obtain ratification of the resolution 2856
in accordance with this division. 2857
Not later than fourteen days after declaring the new fees 2858

S. B. No. 147 Page 96

to be ratified or the fees to be repealed under this division, 2859
the committee shall notify by certified mail the owner or 2860
operator of each solid waste disposal facility that is required 2861
to collect the fees of the ratification and the amount of the 2862
fees or of the repeal of the fees. Collection of any fees shall 2863
commence or collection of repealed fees shall cease on the first 2864
day of the second month following the month in which 2865
notification is sent to the owner or operator. 2866
Fees levied under this division also may be established, 2867
amended, or repealed by a solid waste management policy 2868
committee through the adoption of a new district solid waste 2869
management plan, the adoption of an amended plan, or the 2870
amendment of the plan or amended plan in accordance with 2871
sections 3734.55 and 3734.56 of the Revised Code or the adoption 2872
or amendment of a district plan in connection with a change in 2873
district composition under section 3734.521 of the Revised Code. 2874
Not later than fourteen days after the director issues an 2875
order approving a district's solid waste management plan, 2876
amended plan, or amendment to a plan or amended plan that 2877
establishes, amends, or repeals a schedule of fees levied by the 2878
district, the committee shall notify by certified mail the owner 2879

required to collect the fees of the approval of the plan or 2881
amended plan, or the amendment to the plan, as appropriate, and 2882
the amount of the fees, if any. In the case of an initial or 2883
amended plan approved under section 3734.521 of the Revised Code 2884
in connection with a change in district composition, other than 2885
one involving the withdrawal of a county from a joint district, 2886

fund. 3358
If the director does not disapprove a proposed quarterly 3359

board of county commissioners or directors of a district from 3364
making necessary expenditures to meet unforeseen circumstances 3365
that occur during a calendar quarter that were not provided for 3366
in the proposed budget for that quarter. Prior to making any 3367
such expenditure, the board shall notify the director of the 3368
nature of the unforeseen circumstances and of the amount of the 3369
expenditure needed to meet them. The board shall include an 3370
explanation of the nature of the unforeseen circumstances and of 3371
the necessity and amount of the expenditures to meet them in the 3372

or 3734.56 of the Revised Code, or if repeated whole or partial 3382
disapprovals of the proposed quarterly budgets of the district 3383

may issue an order to the board terminating the collection of 3385
all of the fees levied by the district under division (A) or (B) 3386
of this section. 3387
Notwithstanding section 119.06 of the Revised Code, the 3388
director may issue an order under this division or disapprove in 3389

section by issuance of a final action that is effective upon 3391
issuance without the necessity to hold any adjudication hearing 3392
in connection with the order or disapproval and without the 3393
issuance of a proposed action under section 3745.07 of the 3394
Revised Code. 3395
(G) The director, in accordance with Chapter 119. of the 3396
Revised Code, may adopt, amend, suspend, and rescind such rules 3397

Section 3. Section 3734.56 of the Revised Code is 3413
presented in this act as a composite of the section as amended 3414
by both S.B. 153 and S.B. 165 of the 120th General Assembly. The 3415
