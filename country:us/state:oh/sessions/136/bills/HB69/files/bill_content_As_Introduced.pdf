the numerator of which is the sum of the book value of the 1287
qualifying investee's physical assets in this state on the last 1288

immediately prior to the day on which the trust recognizes the 1290
qualifying trust amount, and the denominator of which is the sum 1291
of the book value of the qualifying investee's total physical 1292
assets everywhere on the last day of the qualifying investee's 1293
fiscal or calendar year ending immediately prior to the day on 1294
which the trust recognizes the qualifying trust amount. If, for 1295

section, the trust's portion of modified nonbusiness income 1312
recognized from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of a 1313
debt interest in or equity interest in a section 5747.212 1314
entity, as defined in section 5747.212 of the Revised Code, 1315
without regard to division (A) of that section, shall not be 1316

the Revised Code but shall be apportioned to this state in 1318
accordance with division (B) of section 5747.212 of the Revised 1319
Code without regard to division (A) of that section. 1320
If the allocation and apportionment of a trust's income 1321
under divisions (AA)(4)(a) and (c) of this section do not fairly 1322
represent the modified Ohio taxable income of the trust in this 1323
state, the alternative methods described in division (C) of 1324

a trust. For the purposes of division (AA)(2)(a) of this section 1331
and for the purpose of computing the fraction described in 1332
division (AA)(4)(b) of this section, all of the following apply: 1333
(i) If the qualifying investee is a member of a qualifying 1334
controlled group on the last day of the qualifying investee's 1335
fiscal or calendar year ending immediately prior to the date on 1336
which the trust recognizes the gain or loss, then "qualifying 1337
investee" includes all persons in the qualifying controlled 1338
group on such last day. 1339

loss, separately or cumulatively own, directly or indirectly, on 1345
the last day of the qualifying investee's fiscal or calendar 1346
year ending immediately prior to the date on which the trust 1347
recognizes the qualifying trust amount, more than fifty per cent 1348
of the equity of a pass-through entity, then the qualifying 1349
investee and the other members are deemed to own the 1350
proportionate share of the pass-through entity's physical assets 1351
which the pass-through entity directly or indirectly owns on the 1352
last day of the pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year 1353
ending within or with the last day of the qualifying investee's 1354
fiscal or calendar year ending immediately prior to the date on 1355

also a qualifying investee, is deemed to own, on the last day of 1363
the upper level pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year, 1364
the proportionate share of the lower level pass-through entity's 1365
physical assets that the lower level pass-through entity 1366
directly or indirectly owns on the last day of the lower level 1367
pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year ending within or 1368
with the last day of the upper level pass-through entity's 1369
fiscal or calendar year. If the upper level pass-through entity 1370
directly and indirectly owns less than fifty per cent of the 1371

equity of the lower level pass-through entity on each day of the 1372
upper level pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year in 1373
which or with which ends the calendar or fiscal year of the 1374
lower level pass-through entity and if, based upon clear and 1375
convincing evidence, complete information about the location and 1376
cost of the physical assets of the lower pass-through entity is 1377
not available to the upper level pass-through entity, then 1378
solely for purposes of ascertaining if a gain or loss 1379
constitutes a qualifying trust amount, the upper level pass- 1380
through entity shall be deemed as owning no equity of the lower 1381
level pass-through entity for each day during the upper level 1382
pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year in which or with 1383
which ends the lower level pass-through entity's calendar or 1384
fiscal year. Nothing in division (AA)(5)(a)(iii) of this section 1385
shall be construed to provide for any deduction or exclusion in 1386
computing any trust's Ohio taxable income. 1387
(b) With respect to a trust that is not a resident for the 1388
taxable year and with respect to a part of a trust that is not a 1389
resident for the taxable year, "qualifying investee" for that 1390
taxable year does not include a C corporation if both of the 1391
following apply: 1392
(i) During the taxable year the trust or part of the trust 1393
recognizes a gain or loss from the sale, exchange, or other 1394
disposition of equity or ownership interests in, or debt 1395

(ii) Such gain or loss constitutes nonbusiness income. 1397
(6) "Available" means information is such that a person is 1398
able to learn of the information by the due date plus 1399
