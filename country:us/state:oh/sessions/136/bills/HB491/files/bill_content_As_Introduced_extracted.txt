H. B. No. 491 Page 12
As Introduced

time after the removal or resignation, the probate court may 311
appoint, ex parte and with or without notice to the ward or 312
interested parties, an interim guardian for a maximum period of 313
fifteen days. If the court appoints the interim guardian ex 314
parte or without notice to the ward, the court, at its first 315
opportunity, shall enter upon its journal with specificity the 316
reason for acting ex parte or without notice, and, as soon as 317
possible, shall serve upon the ward a copy of the order 318
appointing the interim guardian. For good cause shown, after 319
notice to the ward and interested parties and after a hearing, 320
the court may extend an interim guardianship for a specified 321
period, but not to exceed an additional thirty daystwo 322
subsequent thirty-day periods. 323

this section dies, resigns, is removed, or an interim 325

the person, the estate, or both, notice of the vacancy shall be 328
provided to the ward and sent to the ward's nearest next of kin 329

address of that next of kin. The court may appoint a successor 331
guardian upon application by any interested party after 332
providing notice to the ward, or may appoint a successor 333
guardian subject to divisions (C) and (D) of this section if the 334
court finds it necessary to determine the suitability of the 335
applicants or it would otherwise be in the ward's best interest. 336
If a successor guardian application has not been filed by an 337
interested party within thirty days of the notice of the 338
vacancy, the court may appoint a successor guardian sua sponte 339
and without a hearing or further notice to the ward, except that 340
H. B. No. 491 Page 13
As Introduced
the court shall provide notice to the ward following the 341
appointment of the successor guardian. 342
(4) If a minor or incompetent adult has not been placed 343
under a guardianship pursuant to division (A) of this section 344
and if an emergency exists and it is reasonably certain that 345
immediate action is required to prevent significant injury to 346
the person or estate of the minor or incompetent adult, at any 347
time after it receives notice of the emergency, the court, ex 348
parte, may issue any order that it considers necessary to 349
prevent injury to the person or estate of the minor or 350
incompetent adult, or may appoint an emergency guardian for a 351
maximum period of seventy-two hours. A written copy of any order 352
issued by a court under this division shall be served upon the 353
incompetent or minor or incompetent adult as soon as possible 354
after its issuance. Failure to serve that order after its 355
issuance or prior to the taking of any action under its 356
authority does not invalidate the order or the actions taken. 357
The powers of an emergency guardian shall be specified in the 358
letters of appointment, and shall be limited to those powers 359
that are necessary to prevent injury to the person or estate of 360
the minor or incompetent adult. If the court acts ex parte or 361
without notice to the minor or incompetent adult, the court, at 362
its first opportunity, shall enter upon its journal a record of 363
the case and, with specificity, the reason for acting ex parte 364
or without notice. For good cause shown, after notice to the 365
minor or incompetent adult and interested parties, and after a 366
hearing, the court may extend an emergency guardianship for a 367
specified period, but not to exceed an additional thirty days. 368

guardian under division (A) or (B)(1) of this section, the court 370

considered by the court. 396

powers granted by law to the conservator or court, except that 445
the petitioner may not limit the powers granted to the court by 446
this section and may not limit the requirement for bond as 447

(B)(1) If the probate court finds it to be in the best 293
interest of a minor or an incompetent or minoradult, it may 294
appoint pursuant to divisions (A) and (C) of this section, on 295
its own motion or on application by an interested party, a 296
limited guardian with specific limited powers. The sections of 297
the Revised Code, rules, and procedures governing guardianships 298
apply to a limited guardian, except that the order of 299
appointment and letters of authority of a limited guardian shall 300
state the reasons for, and specify the limited powers of, the 301
guardian. The court may appoint a limited guardian for a 302
definite or indefinite period. An incompetent or A minor or an 303
incompetent adult for whom a limited guardian has been appointed 304
retains all of the incompetent's or minor's or incompetent 305
adult's rights in all areas not affected by the court order 306
appointing the limited guardian. 307
(2) If a guardian appointed pursuant to division (A) of 308
this section is temporarily or permanently removed or resigns, 309

H. B. No. 491 Page 12
As Introduced
and if the welfare of the ward requires immediate action, at any 310
time after the removal or resignation, the probate court may 311
appoint, ex parte and with or without notice to the ward or 312
interested parties, an interim guardian for a maximum period of 313
fifteen days. If the court appoints the interim guardian ex 314
parte or without notice to the ward, the court, at its first 315
opportunity, shall enter upon its journal with specificity the 316
reason for acting ex parte or without notice, and, as soon as 317
possible, shall serve upon the ward a copy of the order 318
appointing the interim guardian. For good cause shown, after 319
notice to the ward and interested parties and after a hearing, 320
the court may extend an interim guardianship for a specified 321
period, but not to exceed an additional thirty daystwo 322
subsequent thirty-day periods. 323

this section dies, resigns, is removed, or an interim 325
guardianship established pursuant to division (B)(2) of this 326
section expires, and the ward is still in need of a guardian of 327
the person, the estate, or both, notice of the vacancy shall be 328
provided to the ward and sent to the ward's nearest next of kin 329
by regular United States mail, provided the court knows the 330
address of that next of kin. The court may appoint a successor 331
guardian upon application by any interested party after 332
providing notice to the ward, or may appoint a successor 333
guardian subject to divisions (C) and (D) of this section if the 334
court finds it necessary to determine the suitability of the 335
applicants or it would otherwise be in the ward's best interest. 336
If a successor guardian application has not been filed by an 337
interested party within thirty days of the notice of the 338
vacancy, the court may appoint a successor guardian sua sponte 339
and without a hearing or further notice to the ward, except that 340

H. B. No. 491 Page 13

the court shall provide notice to the ward following the 341
appointment of the successor guardian. 342
(4) If a minor or incompetent adult has not been placed 343
under a guardianship pursuant to division (A) of this section 344
and if an emergency exists and it is reasonably certain that 345
immediate action is required to prevent significant injury to 346
the person or estate of the minor or incompetent adult, at any 347
time after it receives notice of the emergency, the court, ex 348
parte, may issue any order that it considers necessary to 349
prevent injury to the person or estate of the minor or 350
incompetent adult, or may appoint an emergency guardian for a 351
maximum period of seventy-two hours. A written copy of any order 352
issued by a court under this division shall be served upon the 353
incompetent or minor or incompetent adult as soon as possible 354
after its issuance. Failure to serve that order after its 355
issuance or prior to the taking of any action under its 356
authority does not invalidate the order or the actions taken. 357
The powers of an emergency guardian shall be specified in the 358
letters of appointment, and shall be limited to those powers 359
that are necessary to prevent injury to the person or estate of 360
the minor or incompetent adult. If the court acts ex parte or 361
without notice to the minor or incompetent adult, the court, at 362
its first opportunity, shall enter upon its journal a record of 363
the case and, with specificity, the reason for acting ex parte 364
or without notice. For good cause shown, after notice to the 365
minor or incompetent adult and interested parties, and after a 366
hearing, the court may extend an emergency guardianship for a 367
specified period, but not to exceed an additional thirty days. 368

(5) Evidence of a less restrictive alternative to 394
guardianship may be introduced, and when introduced, shall be 395
considered by the court. 396
(6) The court may deny a guardianship based upon a finding 397
that a less restrictive alternative to guardianship exists. 398

attorney under section 1337.24 of the Revised Code or a writing 418
as described in division (A) of section 2111.121 of the Revised 419
Code, the person nominated has preference in appointment over a 420
person selected by the minor. A person who has been nominated to 421
be a guardian of the person of a minor in or pursuant to a 422
durable power of attorney or writing of that nature does not 423
have preference in appointment over a person selected by the 424
minor, but the probate court may appoint the person named in the 425
durable power of attorney or the writing, the person selected by 426
the minor, or another person as guardian of the person of the 427

not have a spouse or an adult child and has not designated a 436
guardian prior to the court finding the adult child incompetent. 437
Sec. 2111.021. A competent adult who is physically infirm 438
may petition the probate court of the county in which the 439
petitioner resides, to place, for a definite or indefinite 440
period of time, the petitioner's person, any or all of the 441
petitioner's real or personal property, or both under a 442
conservatorship with the court. A petitioner either may grant 443
specific powers to the conservator or court or may limit any 444
powers granted by law to the conservator or court, except that 445
the petitioner may not limit the powers granted to the court by 446
this section and may not limit the requirement for bond as 447
determined by the court. The petition shall state whether the 448
person of the competent adult will be placed under the 449
conservatorship, shall state with particularity all real and 450
personal property that will be placed under the conservatorship, 451
shall state the powers granted and any limitation upon the 452
powers of the conservator or court, and shall state the name of 453
a proposed suitable conservator. 454
After a hearing, if the court finds that the petition was 455
voluntarily filed and that the proposed conservator is suitable, 456

A conservatorship shall terminate upon a judicial 465
determination of incompetency, the death of the petitioner, the 466
order of the probate court, or the execution of a written 467
termination notice by the petitioner. A termination notice shall 468
take effect upon execution by the petitioner, and shall be filed 469
with the court and served upon the conservator. A termination 470
notice executed by a petitioner relative to a conservatorship of 471
the estate and the termination of a conservatorship of the 472
estate based upon a termination notice are void unless the 473
termination notice is filed with the court within fourteen days 474
after its execution. Modification of the powers of a conservator 475
or the court may be made by the petitioner upon motion to the 476
court at any time during the conservatorship. Neither the 477
establishment of a conservatorship nor the filing of a petition 478

Revised Code. 481

pertains to a conservatorship and that is in the possession of 486
the court. 487

the court or applicant has reason to believe is missing or has 491

financial harm to the individual. The order may freeze the 494
individual's assets for a period not exceeding seventy-two 495
hours. If the individual is located, a written copy of the order 496
shall be served upon the individual as soon as possible after 497
its issuance. The court, at its first opportunity, shall enter 498
upon its journal a record of the case and, with specificity, the 499
reason for the action. For good cause shown, after notice to the 500
individual and after a hearing, the court may extend the 501
emergency order for a specified period of not more than thirty 502
additional days. 503
