year pursuant to this division shall be reduced on a basis 864
proportionate to the amount by which the amount of the undivided 865
local government fund for that calendar year is less than the 866

the calendar year 1970. 868
(J) On the basis of such apportionment, the county auditor 869
shall compute the percentage share of each such subdivision in 870
the undivided local government fund and shall at the same time 871
certify to the tax commissioner the percentage share of the 872
county as a subdivision. No payment shall be made from the 873
undivided local government fund, except in accordance with such 874
percentage shares. 875
Within ten days after the budget commission has made its 876
apportionment, whether conducted pursuant to section 5747.51 or 877

Section 39:
5747.53 of the Revised Code, the auditor shall publish a list of 878
the subdivisions and the amount each is to receive from the 879
undivided local government fund and the percentage share of each 880
subdivision, in a newspaper or newspapers of countywide 881
circulation, and send a copy of such allocation to the tax 882
commissioner. 883
The county auditor shall also send a copy of such 884
allocation by ordinary or electronic mail to the fiscal officer 885
of each subdivision entitled to participate in the allocation of 886
the undivided local government fund of the county. This copy 887
shall constitute the official notice of the commission action 888
referred to in section 5705.37 of the Revised Code. 889
All money received into the treasury of a subdivision from 890
the undivided local government fund in a county treasury shall 891

As Introduced
If a municipal corporation maintains a municipal 894
university, such municipal university, when the board of 895
trustees so requests the legislative authority of the municipal 896
corporation, shall participate in the money apportioned to such 897
municipal corporation from the total local government fund, 898
however created and constituted, in such amount as requested by 899
the board of trustees, provided such sum does not exceed nine 900
per cent of the total amount paid to the municipal corporation. 901
If any public official fails to maintain the records 902
required by sections 5747.50 to 5747.55 of the Revised Code or 903
by the rules issued by the tax commissioner, the auditor of 904
state, or the treasurer of state pursuant to such sections, or 905
fails to comply with any law relating to the enforcement of such 906

Section 40:
sections, the local government fund money allocated to the 907
county may be withheld until such time as the public official 908
has complied with such sections or such law or the rules issued 909
pursuant thereto. 910
Sec. 5747.53. (A) As used in this section: 911
(1) "City, located wholly or partially in the county, with 912
the greatest population" means the city, located wholly or 913
partially in the county, with the greatest population residing 914
in the county; however, if the county budget commission on or 915
before January 1, 1998, adopted an alternative method of 916
apportionment that was approved by the legislative authority of 917
the city, located partially in the county, with the greatest 918
population but not the greatest population residing in the 919
county, "city, located wholly or partially in the county, with 920
the greatest population" means the city, located wholly or 921
partially in the county, with the greatest population whether 922
residing in the county or not, if this alternative meaning is 923
H. B. No. 26 Page 33

adopted by action of the board of county commissioners and a 924
majority of the boards of township trustees and legislative 925
authorities of municipal corporations located wholly or 926
partially in the county. 927
(2) "Participating political subdivision" means a 928
municipal corporation or township that satisfies all of the 929

(b) It is not the city, located wholly or partially in the 932
county, with the greatest population. 933
(c) Undivided local government fund moneys are apportioned 934
to it under the county's alternative method or formula of 935
apportionment in the current calendar year. 936
(B) In lieu of the method of apportionment of the 937
undivided local government fund of the county provided by 938

Section 41:
section 5747.51 of the Revised Code, the county budget 939
commission may provide for the apportionment of the fund under 940
an alternative method or on a formula basis as authorized by 941
this section. The commissioner shall reduce the amount of funds 942
from the undivided local government fund to a subdivision 943
required to receive reduced funds under section 5747.502 or 944

Section 42:
5747.504 of the Revised Code. 945
Except as otherwise provided in division (C) of this 946

Section 43:
section, the alternative method of apportionment shall have 947
first been approved by all of the following governmental units: 948
the board of county commissioners; the legislative authority of 949
the city, located wholly or partially in the county, with the 950
greatest population; and a majority of the boards of township 951

H. B. No. 26 Page 34
As Introduced
located wholly or partially in the county, excluding the 953
legislative authority of the city, located wholly or partially 954
in the county, with the greatest population. In granting or 955
denying approval for an alternative method of apportionment, the 956
board of county commissioners, boards of township trustees, and 957
legislative authorities of municipal corporations shall act by 958
motion. A motion to approve shall be passed upon a majority vote 959
of the members of a board of county commissioners, board of 960
township trustees, or legislative authority of a municipal 961
corporation, shall take effect immediately, and need not be 962
published. 963
Any alternative method of apportionment adopted and 964
approved under this division shall be reviewed by the county 965
budget commission at a public hearing held at least once in the 966
year following the effective date of this amendment October 3, 967
2023, and in every fifth year thereafter. The county budget 968
commission shall provide reasonable advance notice of the 969
hearing to all political subdivisions eligible to participate in 970
the fund and shall take public testimony from any such political 971
subdivision that wishes to testify. 972
Any alternative method of apportionment adopted and 973
approved under this division may be revised, amended, or 974
repealed in the same manner as it may be adopted and approved. 975
If an alternative method of apportionment adopted and approved 976
under this division is repealed, the undivided local government 977
fund of the county shall be apportioned among the subdivisions 978
eligible to participate in the fund, commencing in the ensuing 979
calendar year, under the apportionment provided in section 980

Section 44:
5747.52 of the Revised Code, unless the repeal occurs by 981
operation of division (C) of this section or a new method for 982
apportionment of the fund is provided in the action of repeal. 983
H. B. No. 26 Page 35
As Introduced

city, located wholly or partially in the county, with the 985
greatest population has a population of twenty thousand or less 986
and a population that is less than fifteen per cent of the total 987
population of the county. In such a county, the legislative 988
authorities or boards of township trustees of two or more 989
participating political subdivisions, which together have a 990
population residing in the county that is a majority of the 991
total population of the county, each may adopt a resolution to 992
exclude the approval otherwise required of the legislative 993
authority of the city, located wholly or partially in the 994
county, with the greatest population. All of the resolutions to 995
exclude that approval shall be adopted not later than the first 996
Monday of August of the year preceding the calendar year in 997
which distributions are to be made under an alternative method 998
of apportionment. 999
A motion granting or denying approval of an alternative 1000
method of apportionment under this division shall be adopted by 1001
a majority vote of the members of the board of county 1002
commissioners and by a majority vote of a majority of the boards 1003
of township trustees and legislative authorities of the 1004
municipal corporations located wholly or partially in the 1005
county, other than the city, located wholly or partially in the 1006
county, with the greatest population, shall take effect 1007
immediately, and need not be published. The alternative method 1008
of apportionment under this division shall be adopted and 1009
approved annually, not later than the first Monday of August of 1010
the year preceding the calendar year in which distributions are 1011
to be made under it. A motion granting approval of an 1012
alternative method of apportionment under this division repeals 1013
any existing alternative method of apportionment, effective with 1014
H. B. No. 26 Page 36

distributions to be made from the fund in the ensuing calendar 1015
year. An alternative method of apportionment under this division 1016
shall not be revised or amended after the first Monday of August 1017
of the year preceding the calendar year in which distributions 1018
are to be made under it. 1019
(D) In determining an alternative method of apportionment 1020
authorized by this section, the county budget commission may 1021
include in the method any factor considered to be appropriate 1022
and reliable, in the sole discretion of the county budget 1023
commission. 1024
(E) The limitations set forth in section 5747.51 of the 1025
Revised Code, stating the maximum amount that the county may 1026
receive from the undivided local government fund and the minimum 1027
amount the townships in counties having a population of less 1028
than one hundred thousand may receive from the fund, are 1029
applicable to any alternative method of apportionment authorized 1030
under this section. 1031
(F) On the basis of any alternative method of 1032
apportionment adopted and approved as authorized by this 1033

Section 45:
section, as certified by the auditor to the county treasurer, 1034
the county treasurer shall make distribution of the money in the 1035
undivided local government fund to each subdivision eligible to 1036
participate in the fund, and the auditor, when the amount of 1037
those shares is in the custody of the treasurer in the amounts 1038
so computed to be due the respective subdivisions, shall at the 1039
same time certify to the tax commissioner the percentage share 1040
of the county as a subdivision. All money received into the 1041
treasury of a subdivision from the undivided local government 1042
fund in a county treasury shall be paid into the general fund 1043
and used for the current operating expenses of the subdivision. 1044
H. B. No. 26 Page 37
As Introduced
If a municipal corporation maintains a municipal university, the 1045
university, when the board of trustees so requests the 1046
legislative authority of the municipal corporation, shall 1047
participate in the money apportioned to the municipal 1048
corporation from the total local government fund, however 1049
created and constituted, in the amount requested by the board of 1050
trustees, provided that amount does not exceed nine per cent of 1051
the total amount paid to the municipal corporation. 1052
(G) The actions of the county budget commission taken 1053
pursuant to this section are final and may not be appealed to 1054
the board of tax appeals, except on the issues of abuse of 1055
discretion and failure to comply with the formula. 1056

Section 46:
Section 2. That existing sections 9.63, 4501.06, 5747.50, 1057

Section 47:
5747.502, 5747.51, and 5747.53 of the Revised Code are hereby 1058
repealed. 1059

Section 48:
Section 3. If any provision of this act or the application 1060
of this act to any person or circumstance is held invalid, that 1061
invalidity does not affect any other provisions or applications 1062
of this act that can be given effect without the invalid 1063
provision or application. 1064

Section 49:
Section 4. (A) The General Assembly finds that all of the 1065
following are true: 1066
(1) Sanctuary policies that restrict, obstruct, or 1067
discourage cooperation with federal immigration authorities are 1068
prohibited by such federal laws as Section 642 of the "Omnibus 1069
Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1996," 8 U.S.C. 1373, which 1070
states that "a Federal, State, or local government entity or 1071
official may not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any 1072
government entity or official from sending to, or receiving 1073
H. B. No. 26 Page 38
As Introduced
from, the Immigration and Naturalization Service information 1074
regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or 1075
unlawful, of any individual." 1076
(2) In Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387 (2012), the 1077
Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the United States 1078
Congress has the exclusive authority to legislate on immigration 1079
matters, that states may not augment the penalties for violating 1080
federal immigration laws, that "consultation between federal and 1081
state officials is an important feature of the immigration 1082
system," and that "Congress has encouraged the sharing of 1083
information about possible immigration violations." 1084
(B) The General Assembly declares all of the following: 1085
(1) Given the supremacy of all federal laws pertaining to 1086
immigration, including Section 274 of the "Immigration and 1087
Nationality Act," 8 U.S.C. 1324, as amended, which prohibits 1088
knowingly harboring persons who are unlawfully present in the 1089
United States, it is inappropriate and contrary to the public 1090
safety and welfare of this state for any public official to 1091
encourage, endorse, or otherwise support any public or private 1092
organization that seeks to offer so-called "sanctuary 1093
protection" to persons who are unlawfully present in the United 1094
States. 1095
(2) Policies that direct state or local employees not to 1096
cooperate with federal immigration authorities or that protect 1097
persons who are unlawfully present in the United States are 1098
contrary to federal law, the interests of this state, and the 1099
safety and welfare of the people of this state. 1100
(3) This act is necessary to ensure consistency and 1101
fairness in the enforcement of the laws of this state. 1102
H. B. No. 26 Page 39
As Introduced
(4) The subject of this act is a matter of statewide 1103
concern. 1104

Section 50:
Section 5. This act shall be known as the Protecting Ohio 1105
Communities Act. 1106

Section 51:
Section 6. Section 5747.53 of the Revised Code is 1107
presented in this act as a composite of the section as amended 1108
by H.B. 33 of the 135th General Assembly and H.B. 62 of the 1109
133rd General Assembly. The General Assembly, applying the 1110
principle stated in division (B) of section 1.52 of the Revised 1111
Code that amendments are to be harmonized if reasonably capable 1112
of simultaneous operation, finds that the composite is the 1113
resulting version of the section in effect prior to the 1114
effective date of the section as presented in this act. 1115

Section 52:
Section 7. This act is declared to be an emergency measure 1116
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, 1117
health, and safety. The reason for that necessity is that 1118
government policies that prohibit cooperation with federal 1119
authorities in the enforcement of immigration laws endanger the 1120
public safety and welfare. Therefore, this act shall go into 1121
immediate effect. 1122

amount of the reductions required under division (C) of this 489
section starting with the next required reduction. The LGF 490
adjustment ceases to apply on the thirty-first day of the 491
ensuing July, following which, if an LGF adjustment continues to 492

Nothing in this section prevents the budget commission, 727
for the purpose of apportioning the undivided local government 728

additions to the principal arising from sources other than the 803
reinvestment of investment earnings arising from such a fund, 804
shall not be considered an unencumbered balance or revenue under 805
division (E)(3) or (4) of this section. Only investment earnings 806
arising from investment of the principal or investment of such 807
additions to principal may be considered an unencumbered balance 808
or revenue under those divisions. 809
(F) The total expenditures calculated pursuant to division 810

all participating subdivisions in the county, and shall compute 815
a relative need factor by dividing the total estimate of the 816
undivided local government fund by the total relative need of 817
all participating subdivisions. 818
(H) The relative need of each subdivision shall be 819
multiplied by the relative need factor to determine the 820
proportionate share of the subdivision in the undivided local 821
government fund of the county; provided, that the maximum 822
proportionate share of a county shall not exceed the following 823
maximum percentages of the total estimate of the undivided local 824
government fund governed by the relationship of the percentage 825
of the population of the county that resides within municipal 826
corporations within the county to the total population of the 827

Where the proportionate share of the county exceeds the 833
limitations established in this division, the budget commission 834
shall adjust the proportionate shares determined pursuant to 835
this division so that the proportionate share of the county does 836
not exceed these limitations, and it shall increase the 837
proportionate shares of all other subdivisions on a pro rata 838
basis. In counties having a population of less than one hundred 839
thousand, not less than ten per cent shall be distributed to the 840
townships therein. 841
(I) The proportionate share of each subdivision in the 842
undivided local government fund determined pursuant to division 843

the product of the average of the percentages of the undivided 845
local government fund of the county as apportioned to that 846
subdivision for the calendar years 1968, 1969, and 1970, 847
multiplied by the total amount of the undivided local government 848
fund of the county apportioned pursuant to former section 849
5739.23 of the Revised Code for the calendar year 1970. For the 850
purposes of this division, the total apportioned amount for the 851
calendar year 1970 shall be the amount actually allocated to the 852
county in 1970 from the state collected intangible tax as levied 853
by section 5707.03 of the Revised Code and distributed pursuant 854
to section 5725.24 of the Revised Code, plus the amount received 855

Code. If the total amount of the undivided local government fund 859
for any calendar year is less than the amount of the undivided 860
local government fund apportioned pursuant to former section 861

proportionate to the amount by which the amount of the undivided 865
local government fund for that calendar year is less than the 866
amount of the undivided local government fund apportioned for 867
the calendar year 1970. 868
(J) On the basis of such apportionment, the county auditor 869
shall compute the percentage share of each such subdivision in 870
the undivided local government fund and shall at the same time 871
certify to the tax commissioner the percentage share of the 872
county as a subdivision. No payment shall be made from the 873
undivided local government fund, except in accordance with such 874
percentage shares. 875
Within ten days after the budget commission has made its 876
apportionment, whether conducted pursuant to section 5747.51 or 877
5747.53 of the Revised Code, the auditor shall publish a list of 878
the subdivisions and the amount each is to receive from the 879
undivided local government fund and the percentage share of each 880
subdivision, in a newspaper or newspapers of countywide 881
circulation, and send a copy of such allocation to the tax 882
commissioner. 883
The county auditor shall also send a copy of such 884
allocation by ordinary or electronic mail to the fiscal officer 885
of each subdivision entitled to participate in the allocation of 886
the undivided local government fund of the county. This copy 887

Sec. 5747.53. (A) As used in this section: 911
(1) "City, located wholly or partially in the county, with 912
the greatest population" means the city, located wholly or 913
partially in the county, with the greatest population residing 914
in the county; however, if the county budget commission on or 915
before January 1, 1998, adopted an alternative method of 916
apportionment that was approved by the legislative authority of 917
the city, located partially in the county, with the greatest 918
population but not the greatest population residing in the 919
county, "city, located wholly or partially in the county, with 920
the greatest population" means the city, located wholly or 921
partially in the county, with the greatest population whether 922
residing in the county or not, if this alternative meaning is 923

adopted by action of the board of county commissioners and a 924
majority of the boards of township trustees and legislative 925
authorities of municipal corporations located wholly or 926
partially in the county. 927
(2) "Participating political subdivision" means a 928
municipal corporation or township that satisfies all of the 929
following: 930
(a) It is located wholly or partially in the county. 931
(b) It is not the city, located wholly or partially in the 932
county, with the greatest population. 933
(c) Undivided local government fund moneys are apportioned 934
to it under the county's alternative method or formula of 935
apportionment in the current calendar year. 936
(B) In lieu of the method of apportionment of the 937
undivided local government fund of the county provided by 938
section 5747.51 of the Revised Code, the county budget 939
commission may provide for the apportionment of the fund under 940
an alternative method or on a formula basis as authorized by 941
this section. The commissioner shall reduce the amount of funds 942
from the undivided local government fund to a subdivision 943
required to receive reduced funds under section 5747.502 or 944
5747.504 of the Revised Code. 945
Except as otherwise provided in division (C) of this 946
section, the alternative method of apportionment shall have 947
first been approved by all of the following governmental units: 948
the board of county commissioners; the legislative authority of 949
the city, located wholly or partially in the county, with the 950
greatest population; and a majority of the boards of township 951
trustees and legislative authorities of municipal corporations, 952

H. B. No. 26 Page 34

located wholly or partially in the county, excluding the 953
legislative authority of the city, located wholly or partially 954
in the county, with the greatest population. In granting or 955
denying approval for an alternative method of apportionment, the 956
board of county commissioners, boards of township trustees, and 957
legislative authorities of municipal corporations shall act by 958
motion. A motion to approve shall be passed upon a majority vote 959
of the members of a board of county commissioners, board of 960
township trustees, or legislative authority of a municipal 961
corporation, shall take effect immediately, and need not be 962
published. 963
Any alternative method of apportionment adopted and 964
approved under this division shall be reviewed by the county 965
budget commission at a public hearing held at least once in the 966
year following the effective date of this amendment October 3, 967
2023, and in every fifth year thereafter. The county budget 968
commission shall provide reasonable advance notice of the 969
hearing to all political subdivisions eligible to participate in 970
the fund and shall take public testimony from any such political 971
subdivision that wishes to testify. 972
Any alternative method of apportionment adopted and 973
approved under this division may be revised, amended, or 974
repealed in the same manner as it may be adopted and approved. 975
If an alternative method of apportionment adopted and approved 976
under this division is repealed, the undivided local government 977
fund of the county shall be apportioned among the subdivisions 978
eligible to participate in the fund, commencing in the ensuing 979
calendar year, under the apportionment provided in section 980
5747.52 of the Revised Code, unless the repeal occurs by 981
operation of division (C) of this section or a new method for 982
apportionment of the fund is provided in the action of repeal. 983

(C) This division applies only in counties in which the 984
city, located wholly or partially in the county, with the 985
greatest population has a population of twenty thousand or less 986
and a population that is less than fifteen per cent of the total 987
population of the county. In such a county, the legislative 988
authorities or boards of township trustees of two or more 989
participating political subdivisions, which together have a 990
population residing in the county that is a majority of the 991
total population of the county, each may adopt a resolution to 992
exclude the approval otherwise required of the legislative 993
authority of the city, located wholly or partially in the 994
county, with the greatest population. All of the resolutions to 995
exclude that approval shall be adopted not later than the first 996
Monday of August of the year preceding the calendar year in 997
which distributions are to be made under an alternative method 998
of apportionment. 999
A motion granting or denying approval of an alternative 1000
method of apportionment under this division shall be adopted by 1001
a majority vote of the members of the board of county 1002
commissioners and by a majority vote of a majority of the boards 1003
of township trustees and legislative authorities of the 1004
municipal corporations located wholly or partially in the 1005
county, other than the city, located wholly or partially in the 1006
county, with the greatest population, shall take effect 1007
immediately, and need not be published. The alternative method 1008
of apportionment under this division shall be adopted and 1009
approved annually, not later than the first Monday of August of 1010
the year preceding the calendar year in which distributions are 1011
to be made under it. A motion granting approval of an 1012
alternative method of apportionment under this division repeals 1013
any existing alternative method of apportionment, effective with 1014

H. B. No. 26 Page 36

distributions to be made from the fund in the ensuing calendar 1015
year. An alternative method of apportionment under this division 1016
shall not be revised or amended after the first Monday of August 1017
of the year preceding the calendar year in which distributions 1018
are to be made under it. 1019
(D) In determining an alternative method of apportionment 1020
authorized by this section, the county budget commission may 1021
include in the method any factor considered to be appropriate 1022
and reliable, in the sole discretion of the county budget 1023
commission. 1024
(E) The limitations set forth in section 5747.51 of the 1025
Revised Code, stating the maximum amount that the county may 1026
receive from the undivided local government fund and the minimum 1027
amount the townships in counties having a population of less 1028
than one hundred thousand may receive from the fund, are 1029
applicable to any alternative method of apportionment authorized 1030
under this section. 1031
(F) On the basis of any alternative method of 1032
apportionment adopted and approved as authorized by this 1033
section, as certified by the auditor to the county treasurer, 1034
the county treasurer shall make distribution of the money in the 1035
undivided local government fund to each subdivision eligible to 1036
participate in the fund, and the auditor, when the amount of 1037
those shares is in the custody of the treasurer in the amounts 1038
so computed to be due the respective subdivisions, shall at the 1039
same time certify to the tax commissioner the percentage share 1040
of the county as a subdivision. All money received into the 1041
treasury of a subdivision from the undivided local government 1042
fund in a county treasury shall be paid into the general fund 1043
and used for the current operating expenses of the subdivision. 1044

If a municipal corporation maintains a municipal university, the 1045
university, when the board of trustees so requests the 1046
legislative authority of the municipal corporation, shall 1047
participate in the money apportioned to the municipal 1048
corporation from the total local government fund, however 1049
created and constituted, in the amount requested by the board of 1050
trustees, provided that amount does not exceed nine per cent of 1051
the total amount paid to the municipal corporation. 1052
(G) The actions of the county budget commission taken 1053
pursuant to this section are final and may not be appealed to 1054
the board of tax appeals, except on the issues of abuse of 1055
discretion and failure to comply with the formula. 1056
Section 2. That existing sections 9.63, 4501.06, 5747.50, 1057
5747.502, 5747.51, and 5747.53 of the Revised Code are hereby 1058
repealed. 1059
Section 3. If any provision of this act or the application 1060
of this act to any person or circumstance is held invalid, that 1061
invalidity does not affect any other provisions or applications 1062
of this act that can be given effect without the invalid 1063
provision or application. 1064
Section 4. (A) The General Assembly finds that all of the 1065
following are true: 1066
(1) Sanctuary policies that restrict, obstruct, or 1067
discourage cooperation with federal immigration authorities are 1068
prohibited by such federal laws as Section 642 of the "Omnibus 1069
Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1996," 8 U.S.C. 1373, which 1070
states that "a Federal, State, or local government entity or 1071
official may not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any 1072
government entity or official from sending to, or receiving 1073

H. B. No. 26 Page 38

from, the Immigration and Naturalization Service information 1074
regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or 1075
unlawful, of any individual." 1076
(2) In Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387 (2012), the 1077
Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the United States 1078
Congress has the exclusive authority to legislate on immigration 1079
matters, that states may not augment the penalties for violating 1080
federal immigration laws, that "consultation between federal and 1081
state officials is an important feature of the immigration 1082
system," and that "Congress has encouraged the sharing of 1083
information about possible immigration violations." 1084
(B) The General Assembly declares all of the following: 1085
(1) Given the supremacy of all federal laws pertaining to 1086
immigration, including Section 274 of the "Immigration and 1087
Nationality Act," 8 U.S.C. 1324, as amended, which prohibits 1088
knowingly harboring persons who are unlawfully present in the 1089
United States, it is inappropriate and contrary to the public 1090
safety and welfare of this state for any public official to 1091
encourage, endorse, or otherwise support any public or private 1092
organization that seeks to offer so-called "sanctuary 1093
protection" to persons who are unlawfully present in the United 1094
States. 1095
(2) Policies that direct state or local employees not to 1096
cooperate with federal immigration authorities or that protect 1097
persons who are unlawfully present in the United States are 1098
contrary to federal law, the interests of this state, and the 1099
safety and welfare of the people of this state. 1100
(3) This act is necessary to ensure consistency and 1101
fairness in the enforcement of the laws of this state. 1102

H. B. No. 26 Page 39

(4) The subject of this act is a matter of statewide 1103
concern. 1104
Section 5. This act shall be known as the Protecting Ohio 1105
Communities Act. 1106
Section 6. Section 5747.53 of the Revised Code is 1107
presented in this act as a composite of the section as amended 1108
by H.B. 33 of the 135th General Assembly and H.B. 62 of the 1109
133rd General Assembly. The General Assembly, applying the 1110
principle stated in division (B) of section 1.52 of the Revised 1111
Code that amendments are to be harmonized if reasonably capable 1112
of simultaneous operation, finds that the composite is the 1113
resulting version of the section in effect prior to the 1114
effective date of the section as presented in this act. 1115
Section 7. This act is declared to be an emergency measure 1116
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, 1117
health, and safety. The reason for that necessity is that 1118
government policies that prohibit cooperation with federal 1119
authorities in the enforcement of immigration laws endanger the 1120
public safety and welfare. Therefore, this act shall go into 1121
immediate effect. 1122
