(3) "Donation leave benefits" means compensation paid to 18
an employee donor while the employee is on leave for a period 19
that is medically necessary for such employee to recover from 20
the employee's living donation, provided that the compensation 21
is equal to the compensation the employee would have received if 22
the employee had worked for the qualifying employer in the 23
employee's job for that period and is paid as part of a policy 24
of the employer for living donation that does not deduct time 25
from the employee's other paid leave time. 26
(B)(1) There is hereby allowed a nonrefundable credit 27
against a taxpayer's aggregate tax liability for a taxpayer who 28
is a qualifying employer, or who owns a direct or indirect 29
interest in a qualifying employer, that paid donation leave 30
benefits to an employee donor. The total credit available with 31

donation leave benefits paid, provided that the credit shall not 35
be allowed for more than thirty days of donation leave benefits 36
paid. 37
In the case of a taxpayer who is a qualifying employer, 38
the credit shall be claimed for the taxable year in which the 39

or indirect equity interest in a qualifying employer that paid 41

distributive or proportionate share of the credit for the 43
taxpayer's taxable year that includes the last day of the 44

excess of the aggregate amount of tax due under section 5747.02 52
of the Revised Code, after allowing for any other credits 53
preceding the credit in that order, may be carried forward for 54
three taxable years, but the amount of the excess credit allowed 55
in any such year shall be deducted from the balance carried 56
forward to the next year. 57
(D) On or before the first day of September of the year 58
following the effective date of the enactment of this section, 59
and on the first day of each September thereafter, the tax 60

that deal primarily with taxation. The report shall include, for 64
the preceding taxable year, the total number of taxpayers that 65
claimed a credit under this section and the total value of all 66
