To urge Congress to reissue Department of Defense 1
Civilian Retiree Identification Cards. 2
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE STATE OF OHIO (THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING):
WHEREAS, In February 2023, the United States Department of 3
Defense, pursuant to the federal REAL ID Act, stopped issuing 4
new Civilian Retiree Identification Cards and no longer renews 5
existing cards; and 6
WHEREAS, Civilian Retiree Identification Cards allowed 7
retired civilian Department of Defense personnel to easily 8
access military recreational areas such as Wright-Patterson Air 9
Force Base FamCamp and other camps, parks, and historic sites; 10
and 11
WHEREAS, In order to access these sites, civilian retirees 12
must now request access from the installation commander and 13
present a REAL ID Act-compliant driver's license and retirement 14
documentation; and 15

S. C. R. No. 7 Page 2
As Adopted by the Senate
WHEREAS, The new access requirements are significantly more 16
onerous and restrictive than was previously the case when 17
Civilian Retiree Identification Cards were issued and honored; 18
and 19
WHEREAS, Civilian employees of the Department of Defense 20
form a vital and indispensable component of our national 21
defense; and 22
WHEREAS, Our "civilian retired veterans" deserve full 23
recognition and benefits for their service to our country, 24
including continuing ease of access to military recreational 25
areas upon their retirement; now therefore be it 26
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the 136th General 27
Assembly of the State of Ohio, urge the Congress of the United 28
States to issue Civilian Retiree Identification Cards to 29
qualifying Department of Defense retirees, and to ensure the 30
cards are accepted for access to military recreational areas 31
without the need for further documentation; and be it further 32
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit duly 33
authenticated copies of this resolution to the President of the 34
United States, President Pro Tempore and Secretary of the United 35
States Senate, the Speaker and Clerk of the United States House 36
of Representatives, the members of the Ohio Congressional 37
delegation, and the news media of Ohio. 38
