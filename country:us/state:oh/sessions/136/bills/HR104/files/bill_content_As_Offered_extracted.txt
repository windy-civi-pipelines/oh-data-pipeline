WHEREAS, John Saunders left an indelible impression on the people 5
whose lives he touched, and he will be remembered as a spirited 6
individual who contributed immeasurably to the world around him. An 7
employee of R & L Carriers of Norwalk, a member of the Central Ohio 8
Truck Pulling Circuit, and a fifteen-year member of the Tri-Community 9

night of April 16, 2025, when he tragically passed away in the line of 11
duty; and 12
WHEREAS, Giving generously of his energy and abilities, John 13
Saunders displayed exceptional concern and insight and was tireless in 14
his work to better the world around him. A loving father to his 15
children, Kila and Kaden, and a devoted son, brother, and friend, he 16
always used his talents to the benefit of those around him, and 17
although the void his death has created can never be filled, the 18
legacy of care and commitment he established will surely live on. His 19
absence will be keenly felt; and 20
WHEREAS, At a time when many people are content to take a passive 21
role in life, firefighters often risk their own safety, and in fact 22
their lives, to ensure the well-being of their fellow citizens. The 23
devotion to duty that John Saunders showed in all of his endeavors 24
earned him the genuine respect and gratitude of his colleagues and of 25
the communities he so capably served. The world is a richer place for 26
his having been in it, and he will be sorely missed; therefore be it 27
