quickly to meet the rapidly changing conditions of the twenty- 280
first century. National studies indicate that all high school 281
graduates need the same academic foundation, regardless of the 282
opportunities they pursue after graduation. The goal of Ohio's 283
system of elementary and secondary education is to prepare all 284
students for and seamlessly connect all students to success in 285
life beyond high school graduation, regardless of whether the 286
next step is entering the workforce, beginning an 287
apprenticeship, engaging in post-secondary training, serving in 288
the military, or pursuing a college degree. 289
The requirements for graduation prescribed in division (C) 290
of this section are the standard expectation for all students 291
entering ninth grade for the first time at a public or chartered 292
nonpublic high school on or after July 1, 2010. A student may 293
satisfy this expectation through a variety of methods, 294
including, but not limited to, integrated, applied, career- 295
technical, and traditional coursework. 296
Stronger coordination between high schools and 297
institutions of higher education is necessary to prepare 298
students for more challenging academic endeavors and to lessen 299
the need for academic remediation in college, thereby reducing 300
the costs of higher education for Ohio's students, families, and 301
the state. The department and the chancellor of higher education 302
shall develop policies to ensure that only in rare instances 303
will students who complete the requirements for graduation 304
prescribed in division (C) of this section require academic 305
remediation after high school. 306
School districts, community schools, and chartered 307
nonpublic schools shall integrate technology into learning 308
experiences across the curriculum in order to maximize 309
H. B. No. 304 Page 12
As Introduced
efficiency, enhance learning, and prepare students for success 310
in the technology-driven twenty-first century. Districts and 311
schools shall use distance and web-based course delivery as a 312
method of providing or augmenting all instruction required under 313
this division, including laboratory experience in science. 314
Districts and schools shall utilize technology access and 315
electronic learning opportunities provided by the broadcast 316
educational media commission, chancellor, the Ohio learning 317
network, education technology centers, public television 318
stations, and other public and private providers. 319
(D) Except as provided in division (E) of this section, a 320
student who enters ninth grade on or after July 1, 2010, and 321
before July 1, 2016, may qualify for graduation from a public or 322
chartered nonpublic high school even though the student has not 323
completed the requirements for graduation prescribed in division 324
(C) of this section if all of the following conditions are 325
satisfied: 326
(1) During the student's third year of attending high 327
school, as determined by the school, the student and the 328
student's parent, guardian, or custodian sign and file with the 329
school a written statement asserting the parent's, guardian's, 330
or custodian's consent to the student's graduating without 331
completing the requirements for graduation prescribed in 332
division (C) of this section and acknowledging that one 333
consequence of not completing those requirements is 334
ineligibility to enroll in most state universities in Ohio 335
without further coursework. 336
(2) The student and parent, guardian, or custodian fulfill 337
any procedural requirements the school stipulates to ensure the 338

(J)(1) The department, in consultation with the 516
chancellor, shall adopt a statewide plan implementing methods 517
for students to earn units of high school credit based on a 518
demonstration of subject area competency, instead of or in 519
combination with completing hours of classroom instruction. The 520
plan shall include a standard method for recording demonstrated 521
proficiency on high school transcripts. Each school district and 522
community school shall comply with the department's plan adopted 523
under this division and award units of high school credit in 524
accordance with the plan. The department may adopt existing 525
methods for earning high school credit based on a demonstration 526

school year. 528
(2) The department shall update the statewide plan adopted 529
pursuant to division (J)(1) of this section to also include 530
methods for students enrolled in seventh and eighth grade to 531
meet curriculum requirements based on a demonstration of subject 532

school year, each school district and community school also 535
shall comply with the updated plan adopted pursuant to this 536
division and permit students enrolled in seventh and eighth 537
grade to meet curriculum requirements based on subject area 538
competency in accordance with the plan. 539

or cooperative education. Beginning with the 2018-2019 school 544
year, each district and community school shall comply with the 545
framework. Each district and community school also shall review 546
any policy it has adopted regarding the demonstration of subject 547
area competency to identify ways to incorporate work-based 548
learning experiences, internships, and cooperative education 549
into the policy in order to increase student engagement and 550
opportunities to earn units of high school credit. 551
(K) This division does not apply to students who qualify 552
for graduation from high school under division (D) or (F) of 553
this section, or to students pursuing a career-technical 554
instructional track as determined by the school district board 555
of education or the chartered nonpublic school's governing 556
authority. Nevertheless, the general assembly encourages such 557
students to consider enrolling in a fine arts course as an 558
elective. 559
Beginning with students who enter ninth grade for the 560
first time on or after July 1, 2010, each student enrolled in a 561
public or chartered nonpublic high school shall complete two 562
semesters or the equivalent of fine arts to graduate from high 563
school. The coursework may be completed in any of grades seven 564
to twelve. Each student who completes a fine arts course in 565
grade seven or eight may elect to count that course toward the 566
five units of electives required for graduation under division 567
(C)(8) of this section, if the course satisfied the requirements 568
of division (G) of this section. In that case, the high school 569
shall award the student high school credit for the course and 570
count the course toward the five units required under division 571
(C)(8) of this section. If the course in grade seven or eight 572
did not satisfy the requirements of division (G) of this 573

Section 22:
section, the high school shall not award the student high school 574

(L) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 578

Section 23:
section, the board of education of each school district and the 579
governing authority of each chartered nonpublic school may adopt 580
a policy to excuse from the high school physical education 581
requirement each student who, during high school, has 582
participated in interscholastic athletics, club sports, marching 583
band, show choir, or cheerleading for at least two full seasons, 584
in other athletic activities for at least one hundred twenty 585
hours, or in the junior reserve officer training corps for at 586
least two full school years. If the board or authority adopts 587
such a policy, the board or authority shall not require the 588
student to complete any physical education course as a condition 589
to graduate. However, the student shall be required to complete 590
one-half unit, consisting of at least sixty hours of 591
instruction, in another course of study. In the case of a 592
student who has participated in the junior reserve officer 593
training corps for at least two full school years, credit 594
received for that participation may be used to satisfy the 595
requirement to complete one-half unit in another course of 596
study. 597
(M) It is important that high school students learn and 598
understand United States history and the governments of both the 599

(N) A student may apply one unit of instruction in 620
computer science to satisfy one unit of mathematics or one unit 621
of science under division (C) of this section as the student 622

to the operator, shall enter into a written agreement 90
prescribing reasonable accommodations to meet the scheduling 91
needs of the community school prior to implementation of the 92
change. 93
(F) Subject to section 3327.016 of the Revised Code, prior 94
to making any change in the hours or days in which the schools 95
under its jurisdiction are open for instruction, the board of 96
education of each city, exempted village, and local school 97
district shall consult with the chartered nonpublic schools to 98
which the district is required to transport students under 99
section 3327.01 of the Revised Code and shall consider the 100
effect of the proposed change on the schedule for transportation 101
of those students to their nonpublic schools. The governing 102
authority of a chartered nonpublic school shall consult with 103
each school district board of education that transports students 104

unless that student is attending the school under a state 263
scholarship program as defined in section 3301.0711 of the 264
Revised Code. 265
The study and instruction of financial literacy required 266

As Introduced
quickly to meet the rapidly changing conditions of the twenty- 280
first century. National studies indicate that all high school 281
graduates need the same academic foundation, regardless of the 282
opportunities they pursue after graduation. The goal of Ohio's 283
system of elementary and secondary education is to prepare all 284
students for and seamlessly connect all students to success in 285
life beyond high school graduation, regardless of whether the 286
next step is entering the workforce, beginning an 287
apprenticeship, engaging in post-secondary training, serving in 288
the military, or pursuing a college degree. 289
The requirements for graduation prescribed in division (C) 290
of this section are the standard expectation for all students 291
entering ninth grade for the first time at a public or chartered 292
nonpublic high school on or after July 1, 2010. A student may 293
satisfy this expectation through a variety of methods, 294
including, but not limited to, integrated, applied, career- 295
technical, and traditional coursework. 296
Stronger coordination between high schools and 297
institutions of higher education is necessary to prepare 298
students for more challenging academic endeavors and to lessen 299
the need for academic remediation in college, thereby reducing 300
the costs of higher education for Ohio's students, families, and 301
the state. The department and the chancellor of higher education 302
shall develop policies to ensure that only in rare instances 303
will students who complete the requirements for graduation 304
prescribed in division (C) of this section require academic 305
remediation after high school. 306
School districts, community schools, and chartered 307
nonpublic schools shall integrate technology into learning 308
experiences across the curriculum in order to maximize 309

H. B. No. 304 Page 12
As Introduced
efficiency, enhance learning, and prepare students for success 310
in the technology-driven twenty-first century. Districts and 311
schools shall use distance and web-based course delivery as a 312
method of providing or augmenting all instruction required under 313
this division, including laboratory experience in science. 314
Districts and schools shall utilize technology access and 315
electronic learning opportunities provided by the broadcast 316
educational media commission, chancellor, the Ohio learning 317
network, education technology centers, public television 318
stations, and other public and private providers. 319
(D) Except as provided in division (E) of this section, a 320
student who enters ninth grade on or after July 1, 2010, and 321
before July 1, 2016, may qualify for graduation from a public or 322
chartered nonpublic high school even though the student has not 323
completed the requirements for graduation prescribed in division 324
(C) of this section if all of the following conditions are 325
satisfied: 326
(1) During the student's third year of attending high 327
school, as determined by the school, the student and the 328
student's parent, guardian, or custodian sign and file with the 329
school a written statement asserting the parent's, guardian's, 330
or custodian's consent to the student's graduating without 331
completing the requirements for graduation prescribed in 332
division (C) of this section and acknowledging that one 333
consequence of not completing those requirements is 334
ineligibility to enroll in most state universities in Ohio 335
without further coursework. 336
(2) The student and parent, guardian, or custodian fulfill 337
any procedural requirements the school stipulates to ensure the 338
student's and parent's, guardian's, or custodian's informed 339

H. B. No. 304 Page 13
As Introduced
consent and to facilitate orderly filing of statements under 340
division (D)(1) of this section. Annually, each district or 341
school shall notify the department of the number of students who 342
choose to qualify for graduation under division (D) of this 343
section and the number of students who complete the student's 344
success plan and graduate from high school. 345
(3) The student and the student's parent, guardian, or 346
custodian and a representative of the student's high school 347
jointly develop a student success plan for the student in the 348
manner described in division (C)(1) of section 3313.6020 of the 349
Revised Code that specifies the student matriculating to a two- 350
year degree program, acquiring a business and industry- 351
recognized credential, or entering an apprenticeship. 352
(4) The student's high school provides counseling and 353
support for the student related to the plan developed under 354
division (D)(3) of this section during the remainder of the 355
student's high school experience. 356
(5)(a) Except as provided in division (D)(5)(b) of this 357
section, the student successfully completes, at a minimum, the 358
curriculum prescribed in division (B) of this section. 359

(iii) Science, three units as prescribed by division (B) 373
of this section which shall include inquiry-based laboratory 374
experience that engages students in asking valid scientific 375
questions and gathering and analyzing information. 376
(E) Each school district and chartered nonpublic school 377
retains the authority to require an even more challenging 378
minimum curriculum for high school graduation than specified in 379
division (B) or (C) of this section. A school district board of 380
education, through the adoption of a resolution, or the 381
governing authority of a chartered nonpublic school may 382
stipulate any of the following: 383
(1) A minimum high school curriculum that requires more 384
than twenty units of academic credit to graduate; 385
(2) An exception to the district's or school's minimum 386
high school curriculum that is comparable to the exception 387
provided in division (D) of this section but with additional 388
requirements, which may include a requirement that the student 389
successfully complete more than the minimum curriculum 390
prescribed in division (B) of this section; 391
(3) That no exception comparable to that provided in 392
division (D) of this section is available. 393
If a school district or chartered nonpublic school 394
requires a foreign language as an additional graduation 395

H. B. No. 304 Page 15

requirement under division (E) of this section, a student may 396
apply one unit of instruction in computer coding to satisfy one 397
unit of foreign language. If a student applies more than one 398
computer coding course to satisfy the foreign language 399
requirement, the courses shall be sequential and progressively 400
more difficult. 401
(F) A student enrolled in a dropout prevention and 402
recovery program, which program has received a waiver from the 403
department, may qualify for graduation from high school by 404
successfully completing a competency-based instructional program 405
administered by the dropout prevention and recovery program in 406
lieu of completing the requirements for graduation prescribed in 407
division (C) of this section. The department shall grant a 408
waiver to a dropout prevention and recovery program, within 409
sixty days after the program applies for the waiver, if the 410
program meets all of the following conditions: 411
(1) The program serves only students not younger than 412
sixteen years of age and not older than twenty-one years of age. 413
(2) The program enrolls students who, at the time of their 414
initial enrollment, either, or both, are at least one grade 415
level behind their cohort age groups or experience crises that 416
significantly interfere with their academic progress such that 417
they are prevented from continuing their traditional programs. 418
(3) The program requires students to attain at least the 419
applicable score designated for each of the assessments 420
prescribed under division (B)(1) of section 3301.0710 of the 421

For purposes of meeting graduation requirements, if an 505
end-of-course examination has been prescribed under section 506
3301.0712 of the Revised Code for the subject area delivered 507
through integrated instruction, the school district or school 508
may administer the related subject area examinations upon the 509
student's completion of the integrated course. 510

curriculum, assessments, or the awarding of a high school 514

(J)(1) The department, in consultation with the 516
chancellor, shall adopt a statewide plan implementing methods 517
for students to earn units of high school credit based on a 518
demonstration of subject area competency, instead of or in 519
combination with completing hours of classroom instruction. The 520
plan shall include a standard method for recording demonstrated 521
proficiency on high school transcripts. Each school district and 522
community school shall comply with the department's plan adopted 523
under this division and award units of high school credit in 524
accordance with the plan. The department may adopt existing 525
methods for earning high school credit based on a demonstration 526
of subject area competency as necessary prior to the 2009-2010 527
school year. 528
(2) The department shall update the statewide plan adopted 529
pursuant to division (J)(1) of this section to also include 530
methods for students enrolled in seventh and eighth grade to 531
meet curriculum requirements based on a demonstration of subject 532
area competency, instead of or in combination with completing 533
hours of classroom instruction. Beginning with the 2017-2018 534
school year, each school district and community school also 535
shall comply with the updated plan adopted pursuant to this 536
division and permit students enrolled in seventh and eighth 537
grade to meet curriculum requirements based on subject area 538
competency in accordance with the plan. 539
(3) The department shall develop a framework for school 540
districts and community schools to use in granting units of high 541
school credit to students who demonstrate subject area 542
competency through work-based learning experiences, internships, 543

H. B. No. 304 Page 20

or cooperative education. Beginning with the 2018-2019 school 544
year, each district and community school shall comply with the 545
framework. Each district and community school also shall review 546
any policy it has adopted regarding the demonstration of subject 547
area competency to identify ways to incorporate work-based 548
learning experiences, internships, and cooperative education 549
into the policy in order to increase student engagement and 550
opportunities to earn units of high school credit. 551
(K) This division does not apply to students who qualify 552
for graduation from high school under division (D) or (F) of 553
this section, or to students pursuing a career-technical 554
instructional track as determined by the school district board 555
of education or the chartered nonpublic school's governing 556
authority. Nevertheless, the general assembly encourages such 557
students to consider enrolling in a fine arts course as an 558
elective. 559
Beginning with students who enter ninth grade for the 560
first time on or after July 1, 2010, each student enrolled in a 561
public or chartered nonpublic high school shall complete two 562
semesters or the equivalent of fine arts to graduate from high 563
school. The coursework may be completed in any of grades seven 564
to twelve. Each student who completes a fine arts course in 565
grade seven or eight may elect to count that course toward the 566
five units of electives required for graduation under division 567
(C)(8) of this section, if the course satisfied the requirements 568
of division (G) of this section. In that case, the high school 569
shall award the student high school credit for the course and 570
count the course toward the five units required under division 571
(C)(8) of this section. If the course in grade seven or eight 572
did not satisfy the requirements of division (G) of this 573
section, the high school shall not award the student high school 574

H. B. No. 304 Page 21

semesters or the equivalent of fine arts required by this 576
division. 577
(L) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 578
section, the board of education of each school district and the 579
governing authority of each chartered nonpublic school may adopt 580
a policy to excuse from the high school physical education 581
requirement each student who, during high school, has 582
participated in interscholastic athletics, club sports, marching 583
band, show choir, or cheerleading for at least two full seasons, 584
in other athletic activities for at least one hundred twenty 585
hours, or in the junior reserve officer training corps for at 586
least two full school years. If the board or authority adopts 587
such a policy, the board or authority shall not require the 588
student to complete any physical education course as a condition 589
to graduate. However, the student shall be required to complete 590
one-half unit, consisting of at least sixty hours of 591
instruction, in another course of study. In the case of a 592
student who has participated in the junior reserve officer 593
training corps for at least two full school years, credit 594
received for that participation may be used to satisfy the 595
requirement to complete one-half unit in another course of 596
study. 597
(M) It is important that high school students learn and 598
understand United States history and the governments of both the 599
United States and the state of Ohio. Therefore, beginning with 600
students who enter ninth grade for the first time on or after 601
July 1, 2012, the study of American history and American 602
government required by divisions (B)(6) and (C)(6) of this 603

divisions (B)(6) and (C)(6) of this section shall include the 615
historical evidence of the role of documents such as the 616

(N) A student may apply one unit of instruction in 620
computer science to satisfy one unit of mathematics or one unit 621
of science under division (C) of this section as the student 622
chooses, regardless of the field of certification of the teacher 623
who teaches the course, so long as that teacher meets the 624
licensure requirements prescribed by section 3319.236 of the 625
Revised Code and, prior to teaching the course, completes a 626
professional development program determined to be appropriate by 627
the district board. 628
