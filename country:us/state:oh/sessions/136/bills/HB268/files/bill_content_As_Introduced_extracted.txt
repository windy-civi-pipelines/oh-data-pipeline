opportunity, or certification in question. Notwithstanding the 316
H. B. No. 268 Page 12

person's employment with the employer or licensure for the 324
employer because of a mandatory civil impact, the agency shall 325
give the person individualized consideration, notwithstanding 326
the mandatory civil impact, the mandatory civil impact shall be 327
considered for all purposes to be a discretionary civil impact, 328
and the certificate constitutes a rebuttable presumption that 329
the person's criminal convictions are insufficient evidence that 330
the person is unfit for the employment, or that the employer is 331
unfit for the license or certification, in question. 332
(E) A certificate of qualification for employment does not 333
grant the individual to whom the certificate was issued relief 334

qualification for employment was issued if the person knew of 378

fault. 380
(2) In any proceeding on a claim against an employer for 381
negligent hiring, a certificate of qualification for employment 382
issued to an individual under this section shall provide 383
immunity for the employer as to the claim if the employer knew 384
of the certificate at the time of the alleged negligence. 385
(3) If an employer hires an individual who has been issued 386
a certificate of qualification for employment under this 387

Section 15:
section, if the individual, after being hired, subsequently 388
demonstrates dangerousness or is convicted of or pleads guilty 389
to a felony, and if the employer retains the individual as an 390
employee after the demonstration of dangerousness or the 391
conviction or guilty plea, the employer may be held liable in a 392
civil action that is based on or relates to the retention of the 393
individual as an employee only if it is proved by a 394
preponderance of the evidence that the person having hiring and 395
firing responsibility for the employer had actual knowledge that 396
the employee was dangerous or had been convicted of or pleaded 397
guilty to the felony and was willful in retaining the individual 398
as an employee after the demonstration of dangerousness or the 399
conviction or guilty plea of which the person has actual 400
knowledge. 401

petition for a certificate of qualification for employment to a 418

for damages against the department of rehabilitation and 422
correction or court. 423

adopt rules in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code 425

on an individual applying for or holding a license as a health 283

(8) If a court that receives an individual's petition for 286

H. B. No. 268 Page 11
As Introduced
a certificate of qualification for employment under division (B) 287
(2) of this section or that is forwarded a petition for such a 288
certificate under division (B)(5)(a) of this section denies the 289
petition, the court shall provide written notice to the 290
individual of the court's denial. The court may place conditions 291
on the individual regarding the individual's filing of any 292
subsequent petition for a certificate of qualification for 293
employment. The written notice must notify the individual of any 294
conditions placed on the individual's filing of a subsequent 295
petition for a certificate of qualification for employment. 296
If a court of common pleas that receives an individual's 297
petition for a certificate of qualification for employment under 298
division (B)(2) of this section or that is forwarded a petition 299
for such a certificate under division (B)(5)(a) of this section 300
denies the petition, the individual may appeal the decision to 301
the court of appeals only if the individual alleges that the 302
denial was an abuse of discretion on the part of the court of 303
common pleas. 304
(D)(1) A certificate of qualification for employment 305
issued to an individual lifts the automatic bar of a collateral 306
sanction, and a decision-maker shall consider on a case-by-case 307
basis whether to grant or deny the issuance or restoration of an 308
occupational license or an employment opportunity, 309
notwithstanding the individual's possession of the certificate, 310
without, however, reconsidering or rejecting any finding made by 311
a designee or court under division (C)(3) of this section. 312
(2) The certificate constitutes a rebuttable presumption 313
that the person's criminal convictions are insufficient evidence 314
that the person is unfit for the license, employment 315
opportunity, or certification in question. Notwithstanding the 316

H. B. No. 268 Page 12
As Introduced
presumption established under this division, the agency may deny 317
the license or certification for the person if it determines 318
that the person is unfit for issuance of the license. 319
(3) If an employer that has hired a person who has been 320
issued a certificate of qualification for employment applies to 321
a licensing agency for a license or certification and the person 322
has a conviction or guilty plea that otherwise would bar the 323
person's employment with the employer or licensure for the 324
employer because of a mandatory civil impact, the agency shall 325
give the person individualized consideration, notwithstanding 326
the mandatory civil impact, the mandatory civil impact shall be 327
considered for all purposes to be a discretionary civil impact, 328
and the certificate constitutes a rebuttable presumption that 329
the person's criminal convictions are insufficient evidence that 330
the person is unfit for the employment, or that the employer is 331
unfit for the license or certification, in question. 332
(E) A certificate of qualification for employment does not 333
grant the individual to whom the certificate was issued relief 334
from the mandatory civil impacts identified in division (A)(1) 335
of section 2961.01 or division (B) of section 2961.02 of the 336
Revised Code. 337
(F) A petition for a certificate of qualification for 338
employment filed by an individual under division (B)(1) or (2) 339
of this section shall include all of the following: 340
(1) The individual's name, date of birth, and social 341
security number; 342
(2) All aliases of the individual and all social security 343
numbers associated with those aliases; 344

and months of residence; 349
(5) A general statement as to why the individual has filed 350
the petition and how the certificate of qualification for 351
employment would assist the individual; 352
(6) A summary of the individual's criminal history, except 353
for information contained in any record that has been sealed or 354
expunged under section 2953.32 or 2953.39 of the Revised Code, 355
with respect to each offense that is a disqualification from 356
employment or licensing in an occupation or profession, 357
including the years of each conviction or plea of guilty for 358
each of those offenses; 359
(7) A summary of the individual's employment history, 360
specifying the name of, and dates of employment with, each 361
employer; 362
(8) Verifiable references and endorsements; 363
(9) The name of one or more immediate family members of 364
the individual, or other persons with whom the individual has a 365
close relationship, who support the individual's reentry plan; 366
(10) A summary of the reason the individual believes the 367
certificate of qualification for employment should be granted; 368
(11) Any other information required by rule by the 369
department of rehabilitation and correction. 370
(G)(1) In a judicial or administrative proceeding alleging 371
negligence or other fault, a certificate of qualification for 372
employment issued to an individual under this section may be 373

H. B. No. 268 Page 14
As Introduced
introduced as evidence of a person's due care in hiring, 374
retaining, licensing, leasing to, admitting to a school or 375
program, or otherwise transacting business or engaging in 376
activity with the individual to whom the certificate of 377
qualification for employment was issued if the person knew of 378
the certificate at the time of the alleged negligence or other 379
fault. 380
(2) In any proceeding on a claim against an employer for 381
negligent hiring, a certificate of qualification for employment 382
issued to an individual under this section shall provide 383
immunity for the employer as to the claim if the employer knew 384
of the certificate at the time of the alleged negligence. 385
(3) If an employer hires an individual who has been issued 386
a certificate of qualification for employment under this 387
section, if the individual, after being hired, subsequently 388
demonstrates dangerousness or is convicted of or pleads guilty 389
to a felony, and if the employer retains the individual as an 390
employee after the demonstration of dangerousness or the 391
conviction or guilty plea, the employer may be held liable in a 392
