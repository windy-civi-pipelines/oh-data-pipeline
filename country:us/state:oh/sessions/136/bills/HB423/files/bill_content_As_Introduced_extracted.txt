this section, the commission of the act may be established by a 1661
finding by the board, pursuant to an adjudication under Chapter 1662

Section 204:

jurisdiction under those divisions if the trial court renders a 1665
final judgment in the license holder's favor and that judgment 1666
is based upon an adjudication on the merits. The board has 1667
jurisdiction under those divisions if the trial court issues an 1668
order of dismissal on technical or procedural grounds. 1669
(F) The sealing or expungement of conviction records by 1670
any court shall have no effect on a prior board order entered 1671
under the provisions of this section or on the board's 1672

if, based upon a plea of guilty, a judicial finding of guilt, or 1674
a judicial finding of eligibility for intervention in lieu of 1675
conviction, the board issued a notice of opportunity for a 1676
hearing or took other formal action under Chapter 119. of the 1677
Revised Code prior to the court's order to seal or expunge the 1678
records. The board shall not be required to seal, destroy, 1679
redact, or otherwise modify its records to reflect the court's 1680
sealing or expungement of conviction records. 1681
(G) For purposes of this division, any individual who 1682
holds a license to practice as a surgical assistant, or applies 1683
for a license, shall be deemed to have given consent to submit 1684
to a mental or physical examination when directed to do so in 1685
writing by the board and to have waived all objections to the 1686
admissibility of testimony or examination reports that 1687
constitute a privileged communication. 1688
(1) In enforcing division (B)(5) of this section, the 1689

board, on a showing of a possible violation, shall refer any 1690
individual who holds, or has applied for, a license issued under 1691
this chapter to the monitoring organization that conducts the 1692
program established by the board under section 4731.25 of the 1693
Revised Code. The board also may compel the individual to submit 1694
to a mental or physical examination, or both. A physical 1695
examination may include an HIV test. The expense of the 1696
examination is the responsibility of the individual compelled to 1697
be examined. Failure to submit to a mental or physical 1698
examination or consent to an HIV test ordered by the board 1699
constitutes an admission of the allegations against the 1700
individual unless the failure is due to circumstances beyond the 1701
individual's control, and a default and final order may be 1702
entered without the taking of testimony or presentation of 1703
evidence. If the board finds a surgical assistant unable to 1704
practice because of the reasons set forth in division (B)(5) of 1705
this section, the board shall require the surgical assistant to 1706
submit to care, counseling, or treatment by physicians approved 1707
or designated by the board, as a condition for an initial, 1708
continued, reinstated, or renewed license to practice. An 1709
individual affected by this division shall be afforded an 1710
opportunity to demonstrate to the board the ability to resume 1711
practicing in compliance with acceptable and prevailing 1712
standards of care. 1713
(2) For purposes of division (B)(6) of this section, if 1714
the board has reason to believe that any individual who holds a 1715
license to practice as a surgical assistant or any applicant for 1716
a license suffers such impairment, the board shall refer the 1717
individual to the monitoring organization that conducts the 1718
program established by the board under section 4731.25 of the 1719
Revised Code. The board also may compel the individual to submit 1720
H. B. No. 423 Page 60
As Introduced
to a mental or physical examination, or both. The expense of the 1721
examination is the responsibility of the individual compelled to 1722
be examined. Any mental or physical examination required under 1723
this division shall be undertaken by a treatment provider or 1724
physician qualified to conduct such examination and approved 1725
under section 4731.251 of the Revised Code. 1726
Failure to submit to a mental or physical examination 1727
ordered by the board constitutes an admission of the allegations 1728
against the individual unless the failure is due to 1729
circumstances beyond the individual's control, and a default and 1730
final order may be entered without the taking of testimony or 1731
presentation of evidence. If the board determines that the 1732
individual's ability to practice is impaired, the board shall 1733
suspend the individual's license or deny the individual's 1734
application and shall require the individual, as a condition for 1735
an initial, continued, reinstated, or renewed license, to submit 1736
to treatment. 1737
Before being eligible to apply for reinstatement of a 1738
license suspended under this division, the surgical assistant 1739
shall demonstrate to the board the ability to resume practice in 1740
compliance with acceptable and prevailing standards of care. The 1741
demonstration shall include the following: 1742
(a) Certification from a treatment provider approved under 1743

Section 205:
section 4731.251 of the Revised Code that the individual has 1744
successfully completed any required inpatient treatment; 1745
(b) Evidence of continuing full compliance with an 1746
aftercare contract or consent agreement; 1747
(c) Two written reports indicating that the individual's 1748
ability to practice has been assessed and that the individual 1749
H. B. No. 423 Page 61
As Introduced
has been found capable of practicing according to acceptable and 1750
prevailing standards of care. The reports shall be made by 1751
individuals or providers approved by the board for making such 1752
assessments and shall describe the basis for their 1753
determination. 1754
The board may reinstate a license suspended under this 1755
division after such demonstration and after the individual has 1756
entered into a written consent agreement. 1757
When the impaired surgical assistant resumes practice, the 1758
board shall require continued monitoring of the surgical 1759
assistant. The monitoring shall include monitoring of compliance 1760
with the written consent agreement entered into before 1761
reinstatement or with conditions imposed by board order after a 1762
hearing, and, on termination of the consent agreement, 1763
submission to the board for at least two years of annual written 1764
progress reports made under penalty of falsification stating 1765
whether the surgical assistant has maintained sobriety. 1766
(H)(1) If either of the following circumstances occur, the 1767
secretary and supervising member may recommend that the board 1768
suspend an individual's license to practice without a prior 1769
hearing: 1770

under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code, the board shall enter a 1849
final order permanently revoking the individual's license to 1850

Sec. 4787.19. (A) The state medical board shall 2278
investigate evidence that appears to show that any individual 2279
has violated this chapter or the rules adopted under it. Any 2280
person may report to the board in a signed writing any 2281
information the person has that appears to show a violation of 2282
this chapter or rules adopted under it. In the absence of bad 2283
faith, a person who reports such information or testifies before 2284
the board in an adjudication conducted under Chapter 119. of the 2285
Revised Code shall not be liable for civil damages as a result 2286
of reporting the information or providing testimony. Each 2287
complaint or allegation of a violation received by the board 2288
shall be assigned a case number and be recorded by the board. 2289
(B) Investigations of alleged violations of this chapter 2290
or rules adopted under it shall be supervised by the supervising 2291
member elected by the board in accordance with section 4731.02 2292
of the Revised Code and by the board's secretary, pursuant to 2293

Section 224:
section 4787.02 of the Revised Code. The board's president may 2294
designate another member of the board to supervise the 2295
investigation in place of the supervising member. Upon a vote of 2296
the majority of the board to authorize the addition of a 2297
consumer member in the supervision of any part of any 2298
investigation, the president shall designate a consumer member 2299
for supervision of investigations as determined by the 2300

investigation supervision may be rescinded by a majority vote of 2302
the board. A member of the board who supervises the 2303
investigation of a case shall not participate in further 2304

order the taking of depositions, inspect and copy any books, 2308
accounts, papers, records, or documents, issue subpoenas, and 2309
compel the attendance of witnesses and production of books, 2310
accounts, papers, records, documents, and testimony, except that 2311
a subpoena for patient record information shall not be issued 2312
without consultation with the attorney general's office and 2313
approval of the secretary and supervising member of the board. 2314
Before issuance of a subpoena for patient record information, 2315
the secretary and supervising member shall determine whether 2316
there is probable cause to believe that the complaint filed 2317
alleges a violation of this chapter or the rules adopted under 2318
it and that the records sought are relevant to the alleged 2319
violation and material to the investigation. The subpoena may 2320
apply only to records that cover a reasonable period of time 2321
surrounding the alleged violation. 2322
On failure to comply with any subpoena issued by the board 2323
and after reasonable notice to the person being subpoenaed, the 2324
board may move for an order compelling the production of persons 2325
or records pursuant to the Rules of Civil Procedure. 2326
A subpoena issued by the board may be served by a sheriff, 2327
the sheriff's deputy, or a board employee designated by the 2328
board. Service of a subpoena issued by the board may be made by 2329
delivering a copy of the subpoena to the person named therein, 2330
reading it to the person, or leaving it at the person's usual 2331
place of residence. When the person being served is a surgical 2332
assistant, service of the subpoena may be made by certified 2333
mail, restricted delivery, return receipt requested, and the 2334
H. B. No. 423 Page 81
As Introduced
subpoena shall be deemed served on the date delivery is made or 2335
the date the person refuses to accept delivery. 2336
A sheriff's deputy who serves a subpoena shall receive the 2337
same fees as a sheriff. Each witness who appears before the 2338
board in obedience to a subpoena shall receive the fees and 2339
mileage provided for witnesses in civil cases in the courts of 2340
common pleas. 2341
(D) All hearings and investigations of the board shall be 2342
considered civil actions for the purposes of section 2305.252 of 2343
the Revised Code. 2344
(E) A report required to be submitted to the board under 2345
this chapter, a complaint, or information received by the board 2346
pursuant to an investigation is confidential and not subject to 2347
discovery in any civil action. 2348
The board shall conduct all investigations and proceedings 2349
in a manner that protects the confidentiality of patients and 2350
persons who file complaints with the board. The board shall not 2351
make public the names or any other identifying information about 2352
patients or complainants unless proper consent is given. 2353
The board may share any information it receives pursuant 2354
to an investigation, including patient records and patient 2355
record information, with law enforcement agencies, other 2356
licensing boards, and other governmental agencies that are 2357
prosecuting, adjudicating, or investigating alleged violations 2358
of statutes or administrative rules. An agency or board that 2359
receives the information shall comply with the same requirements 2360
regarding confidentiality as those with which the state medical 2361
board must comply, notwithstanding any conflicting provision of 2362
the Revised Code or procedure of the agency or board that 2363
H. B. No. 423 Page 82
As Introduced
applies when it is dealing with other information in its 2364
possession. In a judicial proceeding, the information may be 2365
admitted into evidence only in accordance with the Rules of 2366
Evidence, but the court shall require that appropriate measures 2367
are taken to ensure that confidentiality is maintained with 2368
respect to any part of the information that contains names or 2369
other identifying information about patients or complainants 2370
whose confidentiality was protected by the state medical board 2371
when the information was in the board's possession. Measures to 2372
ensure confidentiality that may be taken by the court include 2373
sealing its records or deleting specific information from its 2374
records. 2375
No person shall knowingly access, use, or disclose 2376
confidential investigatory information in a manner prohibited by 2377
law. 2378
(F) The state medical board shall develop requirements for 2379
and provide appropriate initial training and continuing 2380
education for investigators employed by the board to carry out 2381
its duties under this chapter. The training and continuing 2382
education may include enrollment in courses operated or approved 2383
by the Ohio peace officer training commission that the board 2384
considers appropriate under conditions set forth in section 2385

Section 225:
109.79 of the Revised Code. 2386

each individual involved in each case. The report is a public 2403
record for purposes of section 149.43 of the Revised Code. 2404

the attorney general, the prosecuting attorney of the county in 2432
which the offense was committed or the offender resides, or the 2433

Upon the filing of a verified petition in court, the court 2435
shall conduct a hearing on the petition and shall give the same 2436

Chapter 119. of the Revised Code, irrespective of the position 2438
of the proceeding on the calendar of the court. 2439

(C) The board shall not refuse to issue a license to an 1637
applicant because of a plea of guilty to, a judicial finding of 1638
guilt of, or a judicial finding of eligibility for intervention 1639

(D) Disciplinary actions taken by the board under 1642
divisions (A) and (B) of this section shall be taken pursuant to 1643

that in lieu of an adjudication, the board may enter into a 1645
consent agreement with a surgical assistant or applicant to 1646
resolve an allegation of a violation of this chapter or any rule 1647
adopted under it. A consent agreement, when ratified by an 1648
affirmative vote of not fewer than six members of the board, 1649
shall constitute the findings and order of the board with 1650
respect to the matter addressed in the agreement. If the board 1651
refuses to ratify a consent agreement, the admissions and 1652
findings contained in the consent agreement shall be of no force 1653

A telephone conference call may be utilized for 1655
ratification of a consent agreement that revokes or suspends an 1656

(E) For purposes of divisions (B)(11), (14), and (15) of 1660
this section, the commission of the act may be established by a 1661
finding by the board, pursuant to an adjudication under Chapter 1662
119. of the Revised Code, that the applicant or license holder 1663
committed the act in question. The board does not have 1664
jurisdiction under those divisions if the trial court renders a 1665
final judgment in the license holder's favor and that judgment 1666
is based upon an adjudication on the merits. The board has 1667
jurisdiction under those divisions if the trial court issues an 1668
order of dismissal on technical or procedural grounds. 1669
(F) The sealing or expungement of conviction records by 1670
any court shall have no effect on a prior board order entered 1671
under the provisions of this section or on the board's 1672
jurisdiction to take action under the provisions of this section 1673
if, based upon a plea of guilty, a judicial finding of guilt, or 1674
a judicial finding of eligibility for intervention in lieu of 1675
conviction, the board issued a notice of opportunity for a 1676
hearing or took other formal action under Chapter 119. of the 1677
Revised Code prior to the court's order to seal or expunge the 1678
records. The board shall not be required to seal, destroy, 1679
redact, or otherwise modify its records to reflect the court's 1680
sealing or expungement of conviction records. 1681
(G) For purposes of this division, any individual who 1682
holds a license to practice as a surgical assistant, or applies 1683
for a license, shall be deemed to have given consent to submit 1684
to a mental or physical examination when directed to do so in 1685
writing by the board and to have waived all objections to the 1686
admissibility of testimony or examination reports that 1687
constitute a privileged communication. 1688
(1) In enforcing division (B)(5) of this section, the 1689

H. B. No. 423 Page 59
As Introduced
board, on a showing of a possible violation, shall refer any 1690
individual who holds, or has applied for, a license issued under 1691
this chapter to the monitoring organization that conducts the 1692
program established by the board under section 4731.25 of the 1693
Revised Code. The board also may compel the individual to submit 1694
to a mental or physical examination, or both. A physical 1695
examination may include an HIV test. The expense of the 1696
examination is the responsibility of the individual compelled to 1697
be examined. Failure to submit to a mental or physical 1698
examination or consent to an HIV test ordered by the board 1699
constitutes an admission of the allegations against the 1700
individual unless the failure is due to circumstances beyond the 1701
individual's control, and a default and final order may be 1702
entered without the taking of testimony or presentation of 1703
evidence. If the board finds a surgical assistant unable to 1704
practice because of the reasons set forth in division (B)(5) of 1705
this section, the board shall require the surgical assistant to 1706
submit to care, counseling, or treatment by physicians approved 1707
or designated by the board, as a condition for an initial, 1708
continued, reinstated, or renewed license to practice. An 1709
individual affected by this division shall be afforded an 1710
opportunity to demonstrate to the board the ability to resume 1711
practicing in compliance with acceptable and prevailing 1712
standards of care. 1713
(2) For purposes of division (B)(6) of this section, if 1714
the board has reason to believe that any individual who holds a 1715
license to practice as a surgical assistant or any applicant for 1716
a license suffers such impairment, the board shall refer the 1717
individual to the monitoring organization that conducts the 1718
program established by the board under section 4731.25 of the 1719
Revised Code. The board also may compel the individual to submit 1720

H. B. No. 423 Page 60
As Introduced
to a mental or physical examination, or both. The expense of the 1721
examination is the responsibility of the individual compelled to 1722
be examined. Any mental or physical examination required under 1723
this division shall be undertaken by a treatment provider or 1724
physician qualified to conduct such examination and approved 1725
under section 4731.251 of the Revised Code. 1726
Failure to submit to a mental or physical examination 1727
ordered by the board constitutes an admission of the allegations 1728
against the individual unless the failure is due to 1729
circumstances beyond the individual's control, and a default and 1730
final order may be entered without the taking of testimony or 1731
presentation of evidence. If the board determines that the 1732
individual's ability to practice is impaired, the board shall 1733
suspend the individual's license or deny the individual's 1734
application and shall require the individual, as a condition for 1735
an initial, continued, reinstated, or renewed license, to submit 1736
to treatment. 1737
Before being eligible to apply for reinstatement of a 1738
license suspended under this division, the surgical assistant 1739
shall demonstrate to the board the ability to resume practice in 1740
compliance with acceptable and prevailing standards of care. The 1741
demonstration shall include the following: 1742
(a) Certification from a treatment provider approved under 1743
section 4731.251 of the Revised Code that the individual has 1744
successfully completed any required inpatient treatment; 1745
(b) Evidence of continuing full compliance with an 1746
aftercare contract or consent agreement; 1747
(c) Two written reports indicating that the individual's 1748
ability to practice has been assessed and that the individual 1749

H. B. No. 423 Page 61
As Introduced
has been found capable of practicing according to acceptable and 1750
prevailing standards of care. The reports shall be made by 1751
individuals or providers approved by the board for making such 1752
assessments and shall describe the basis for their 1753
determination. 1754
The board may reinstate a license suspended under this 1755
division after such demonstration and after the individual has 1756
entered into a written consent agreement. 1757
When the impaired surgical assistant resumes practice, the 1758
board shall require continued monitoring of the surgical 1759
assistant. The monitoring shall include monitoring of compliance 1760
with the written consent agreement entered into before 1761
reinstatement or with conditions imposed by board order after a 1762
hearing, and, on termination of the consent agreement, 1763
submission to the board for at least two years of annual written 1764
progress reports made under penalty of falsification stating 1765
whether the surgical assistant has maintained sobriety. 1766
(H)(1) If either of the following circumstances occur, the 1767
secretary and supervising member may recommend that the board 1768
suspend an individual's license to practice without a prior 1769
hearing: 1770
(a) The secretary and supervising member determine both of 1771
the following: 1772
(i) That there is clear and convincing evidence that a 1773
surgical assistant has violated division (B) of this section; 1774
(ii) That the individual's continued practice presents a 1775
danger of immediate and serious harm to the public. 1776
(b) The board receives verifiable information that a 1777
licensee has been charged in any state or federal court for a 1778

H. B. No. 423 Page 62
As Introduced
crime classified as a felony under the charging court's law and 1779
the conduct charged constitutes a violation of division (B) of 1780
this section. 1781
(2) If a recommendation is made to suspend without a prior 1782
hearing pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section, written 1783
allegations shall be prepared for consideration by the board. 1784
The board, on review of the allegations and by an 1785
affirmative vote of not fewer than six of its members, excluding 1786
the secretary and supervising member, may suspend a license 1787
without a prior hearing. A telephone conference call may be 1788
utilized for reviewing the allegations and taking the vote on 1789
the summary suspension. 1790
The board shall serve a written order of suspension in 1791
accordance with sections 119.05 and 119.07 of the Revised Code. 1792
If the surgical assistant requests an adjudicatory hearing by 1793
the board, the date set for the hearing shall be within fifteen 1794
days, but not earlier than seven days, after the surgical 1795
assistant requests the hearing, unless otherwise agreed to by 1796
both the board and the surgical assistant. 1797
(3) Any summary suspension imposed under division (H)(2) 1798
of this section is not a final appealable order and is not an 1799
adjudication that may be appealed under section 119.12 of the 1800
Revised Code. The summary suspension shall remain in effect 1801
until a final adjudicative order issued by the board pursuant to 1802
this section and Chapter 119. of the Revised Code becomes 1803
effective. Once a final adjudicative order has been issued by 1804
the board, any party adversely affected by it may file an appeal 1805
in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 119. of the 1806
Revised Code. 1807

H. B. No. 423 Page 63
As Introduced
The board shall issue its final adjudicative order within 1808
seventy-five days after completion of its hearing. Failure to 1809
issue the order within seventy-five days shall result in 1810
dissolution of the summary suspension order, but shall not 1811
invalidate any subsequent, final adjudicative order. 1812
(I) If the board takes action under division (B)(10), 1813
(12), or (13) of this section, and the judicial finding of 1814
guilt, guilty plea, or judicial finding of eligibility for 1815
intervention in lieu of conviction is overturned on appeal, on 1816
exhaustion of the criminal appeal, a petition for 1817
reconsideration of the order may be filed with the board along 1818
with appropriate court documents. On receipt of a petition and 1819
supporting court documents, the board shall reinstate the 1820
license to practice as a surgical assistant. The board may then 1821
hold an adjudication under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code to 1822
determine whether the individual committed the act in question. 1823
Notice of opportunity for hearing shall be given in accordance 1824
with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code. If the board finds, 1825
pursuant to an adjudication held under this division, that the 1826
individual committed the act, or if no hearing is requested, it 1827
may order any of the sanctions specified in division (B) of this 1828
section. 1829
(J) The license to practice as a surgical assistant and 1830
the surgical assistant's practice in this state are 1831
automatically suspended as of the date the surgical assistant 1832
pleads guilty to, is found by a judge or jury to be guilty of, 1833
or is subject to a judicial finding of eligibility for 1834
intervention in lieu of conviction in this state or treatment or 1835
intervention in lieu of conviction in another jurisdiction for 1836
any of the following criminal offenses in this state or a 1837
substantially equivalent criminal offense in another 1838

felonious assault, trafficking in persons, kidnapping, rape, 1840
sexual battery, gross sexual imposition, aggravated arson, 1841
aggravated robbery, or aggravated burglary. Continued practice 1842
after the suspension shall be considered practicing without a 1843
license. 1844
The board shall serve the individual subject to the 1845
suspension in accordance with sections 119.05 and 119.07 of the 1846
Revised Code. If an individual whose license is suspended under 1847
this division fails to make a timely request for an adjudication 1848
under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code, the board shall enter a 1849
final order permanently revoking the individual's license to 1850
practice. 1851
(K) In any instance in which the board is required by 1852
Chapter 119. of the Revised Code to give notice of opportunity 1853
for hearing and the individual subject to the notice does not 1854
timely request a hearing in accordance with section 119.07 of 1855
the Revised Code, the board is not required to hold a hearing, 1856
but may adopt, by an affirmative vote of not fewer than six of 1857
its members, a final order that contains the board's findings. 1858
In the final order, the board may order any of the sanctions 1859
identified under division (A) or (B) of this section. 1860
(L) Any action taken by the board under division (B) of 1861
this section resulting in a suspension shall be accompanied by a 1862
written statement of the conditions under which the license of 1863
the surgical assistant may be reinstated. The board shall adopt 1864
rules in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code 1865
governing conditions to be imposed for reinstatement. 1866
Reinstatement of a license suspended pursuant to division (B) of 1867
this section requires an affirmative vote of not fewer than six 1868

members of the board. 1869
(M) When the board refuses to grant or issue a license to 1870
practice as a surgical assistant to an applicant, revokes an 1871
individual's license, refuses to renew an individual's license, 1872
or refuses to reinstate an individual's license, the board may 1873
specify that its action is permanent. An individual subject to a 1874
permanent action taken by the board is forever thereafter 1875
ineligible to hold a license to practice as a surgical 1876
assistant, and the board shall not accept an application for 1877
reinstatement of the license or for issuance of a new license. 1878
(N) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Revised 1879
Code, all of the following apply: 1880
(1) The surrender of a license to practice as a surgical 1881
assistant is not effective unless or until accepted by the 1882
board. A telephone conference call may be utilized for 1883
acceptance of the surrender of an individual's license. The 1884
telephone conference call shall be considered a special meeting 1885
under division (F) of section 121.22 of the Revised Code. 1886
Reinstatement of a license surrendered to the board requires an 1887
affirmative vote of not fewer than six members of the board. 1888
(2) An application made under this chapter for a license 1889
to practice may not be withdrawn without approval of the board. 1890
(3) Failure by an individual to renew a license in 1891
accordance with section 4787.07 of the Revised Code does not 1892
remove or limit the board's jurisdiction to take disciplinary 1893
action under this section against the individual. 1894
(4) The placement of an individual's license on retired 1895
status, as described in section 4787.17 of the Revised Code, 1896
does not remove or limit the board's jurisdiction to take any 1897

H. B. No. 423 Page 66

disciplinary action against the individual with regard to the 1898
license as it existed before being placed on retired status. 1899
(5) At the request of the board, a license holder shall 1900
immediately surrender to the board a license that the board has 1901
suspended, revoked, or permanently revoked. 1902
Sec. 4787.11. (A)(1) If the holder of a license issued 1903
under this chapter violates any section of this chapter, other 1904
than the continuing education requirements described in section 1905
4787.07 of the Revised Code, or violates any rule adopted under 1906
this chapter, the state medical board may, pursuant to an 1907
adjudication under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code and an 1908
affirmative vote of not fewer than six of its members, impose a 1909
civil penalty. The amount of the civil penalty shall be 1910
determined by the board in accordance with the guidelines 1911
adopted under division (A)(2) of this section. The civil penalty 1912
may be in addition to any other action the board may take under 1913
section 4787.10 of the Revised Code. 1914
(2) The board shall adopt and may amend guidelines 1915
regarding the amounts of civil penalties to be imposed under 1916
this section. Adoption or amendment of the guidelines requires 1917
the approval of not fewer than six board members. Under the 1918
guidelines, no civil penalty amount shall exceed twenty thousand 1919
dollars. 1920
(B) Amounts received from payment of civil penalties 1921
imposed under this section shall be deposited by the board in 1922
accordance with section 4731.24 of the Revised Code. Amounts 1923
received from payment of civil penalties imposed for violations 1924
of division (B)(6) of section 4787.10 of the Revised Code shall 1925

chief administrator or executive officer of the facility shall 1943
report to the state medical board the name of the individual, 1944
the action taken by the facility, and a summary of the 1945
underlying facts leading to the action taken. Upon request, the 1946

that were the basis for the facility's action. Prior to release 1948
to the board, the summary shall be approved by the peer review 1949
committee that reviewed the case or by the governing board of 1950
the facility. 1951
The filing of a report with the board or decision not to 1952
file a report, investigation by the board, or any disciplinary 1953
action taken by the board, does not preclude a health care 1954
facility from taking disciplinary action against a surgical 1955
assistant. 1956

surgical assistants, physician, or professional association or 1972
society of physicians that believes a violation of any provision 1973
of this chapter, Chapter 4731. of the Revised Code, or rule of 1974
the board has occurred shall report to the board the information 1975
on which the belief is based. 1976

sexual misconduct, the information upon which the belief is 1995
based shall be reported to the board within thirty days. 1996

The filing of a report with the board or decision not to 2022
file a report, investigation by the board, or any disciplinary 2023

The board shall conduct all investigations and proceedings 2349
in a manner that protects the confidentiality of patients and 2350
persons who file complaints with the board. The board shall not 2351

respect to any part of the information that contains names or 2369
other identifying information about patients or complainants 2370

ensure confidentiality that may be taken by the court include 2373
sealing its records or deleting specific information from its 2374
