(B)(1) Upon request by any person and subject to division 2261
(B)(8) of this section, all public records responsive to the 2262
request shall be promptly prepared and made available for 2263
inspection to the requester at all reasonable times during 2264
regular business hours. Subject to division (B)(8) of this 2265

Section 89:
section, upon request by any person, a public office or person 2266
responsible for public records shall make copies of the 2267
requested public record available to the requester at cost and 2268
H. B. No. 72 Page 78

within a reasonable period of time. If a public record contains 2269
information that is exempt from the duty to permit public 2270
inspection or to copy the public record, the public office or 2271
the person responsible for the public record shall make 2272
available all of the information within the public record that 2273
is not exempt. When making that public record available for 2274
public inspection or copying that public record, the public 2275
office or the person responsible for the public record shall 2276
notify the requester of any redaction or make the redaction 2277
plainly visible. A redaction shall be deemed a denial of a 2278
request to inspect or copy the redacted information, except if 2279
federal or state law authorizes or requires a public office to 2280
make the redaction. When the auditor of state receives a request 2281
to inspect or to make a copy of a record that was provided to 2282
the auditor of state for purposes of an audit, but the original 2283
public office has asserted to the auditor of state that the 2284
record is not a public record, the auditor of state may handle 2285
the requests by directing the requestor to the original public 2286
office that provided the record to the auditor of state. 2287
(2) To facilitate broader access to public records, a 2288
public office or the person responsible for public records shall 2289
organize and maintain public records in a manner that they can 2290
be made available for inspection or copying in accordance with 2291
division (B) of this section. A public office also shall have 2292
available a copy of its current records retention schedule at a 2293
location readily available to the public. If a requester makes 2294
an ambiguous or overly broad request or has difficulty in making 2295
a request for copies or inspection of public records under this 2296

Section 90:
section such that the public office or the person responsible 2297
for the requested public record cannot reasonably identify what 2298
public records are being requested, the public office or the 2299
H. B. No. 72 Page 79
As Introduced
person responsible for the requested public record may deny the 2300
request but shall provide the requester with an opportunity to 2301
revise the request by informing the requester of the manner in 2302
which records are maintained by the public office and accessed 2303
in the ordinary course of the public office's or person's 2304
duties. 2305
(3) If a request is ultimately denied, in part or in 2306
whole, the public office or the person responsible for the 2307
requested public record shall provide the requester with an 2308
explanation, including legal authority, setting forth why the 2309
request was denied. If the initial request was provided in 2310
writing, the explanation also shall be provided to the requester 2311
in writing. The explanation shall not preclude the public office 2312
or the person responsible for the requested public record from 2313
relying upon additional reasons or legal authority in defending 2314
an action commenced under division (C) of this section. 2315
(4) Unless specifically required or authorized by state or 2316
federal law or in accordance with division (B) of this section, 2317
no public office or person responsible for public records may 2318
limit or condition the availability of public records by 2319
requiring disclosure of the requester's identity or the intended 2320
use of the requested public record. Any requirement that the 2321
requester disclose the requester's identity or the intended use 2322
of the requested public record constitutes a denial of the 2323
request. 2324
(5) A public office or person responsible for public 2325
records may ask a requester to make the request in writing, may 2326
ask for the requester's identity, and may inquire about the 2327
intended use of the information requested, but may do so only 2328
after disclosing to the requester that a written request is not 2329
H. B. No. 72 Page 80
As Introduced
mandatory, that the requester may decline to reveal the 2330
requester's identity or the intended use, and when a written 2331
request or disclosure of the identity or intended use would 2332
benefit the requester by enhancing the ability of the public 2333
office or person responsible for public records to identify, 2334
locate, or deliver the public records sought by the requester. 2335
(6) If any person requests a copy of a public record in 2336
accordance with division (B) of this section, the public office 2337
or person responsible for the public record may require the 2338
requester to pay in advance the cost involved in providing the 2339
copy of the public record in accordance with the choice made by 2340
the requester under this division. The public office or the 2341
person responsible for the public record shall permit the 2342
requester to choose to have the public record duplicated upon 2343
paper, upon the same medium upon which the public office or 2344
person responsible for the public record keeps it, or upon any 2345
other medium upon which the public office or person responsible 2346
for the public record determines that it reasonably can be 2347
duplicated as an integral part of the normal operations of the 2348
public office or person responsible for the public record. When 2349
the requester makes a choice under this division, the public 2350
office or person responsible for the public record shall provide 2351
a copy of it in accordance with the choice made by the 2352
requester. Nothing in this section requires a public office or 2353
person responsible for the public record to allow the requester 2354
of a copy of the public record to make the copies of the public 2355
record. 2356
(7)(a) Upon a request made in accordance with division (B) 2357
of this section and subject to division (B)(6) of this section, 2358
a public office or person responsible for public records shall 2359
transmit a copy of a public record to any person by United 2360
H. B. No. 72 Page 81
As Introduced
States mail or by any other means of delivery or transmission 2361
within a reasonable period of time after receiving the request 2362
for the copy. The public office or person responsible for the 2363
public record may require the person making the request to pay 2364
in advance the cost of postage if the copy is transmitted by 2365
United States mail or the cost of delivery if the copy is 2366
transmitted other than by United States mail, and to pay in 2367
advance the costs incurred for other supplies used in the 2368
mailing, delivery, or transmission. 2369
(b) Any public office may adopt a policy and procedures 2370
that it will follow in transmitting, within a reasonable period 2371
of time after receiving a request, copies of public records by 2372
United States mail or by any other means of delivery or 2373
transmission pursuant to division (B)(7) of this section. A 2374
public office that adopts a policy and procedures under division 2375
(B)(7) of this section shall comply with them in performing its 2376
duties under that division. 2377
(c) In any policy and procedures adopted under division 2378
(B)(7) of this section: 2379
(i) A public office may limit the number of records 2380
requested by a person that the office will physically deliver by 2381
United States mail or by another delivery service to ten per 2382
month, unless the person certifies to the office in writing that 2383
the person does not intend to use or forward the requested 2384
records, or the information contained in them, for commercial 2385
purposes; 2386
(ii) A public office that chooses to provide some or all 2387
of its public records on a web site that is fully accessible to 2388

download, or otherwise receive records provided on the web site, 2392
may limit to ten per month the number of records requested by a 2393
person that the office will deliver in a digital format, unless 2394
the requested records are not provided on the web site and 2395
unless the person certifies to the office in writing that the 2396
person does not intend to use or forward the requested records, 2397
or the information contained in them, for commercial purposes. 2398

inspect or to obtain a copy of any public record concerning a 2407
criminal investigation or prosecution or concerning what would 2408
be a criminal investigation or prosecution if the subject of the 2409
investigation or prosecution were an adult, unless the request 2410
to inspect or to obtain a copy of the record is for the purpose 2411
of acquiring information that is subject to release as a public 2412
record under this section and the judge who imposed the sentence 2413
or made the adjudication with respect to the person, or the 2414
judge's successor in office, finds that the information sought 2415
in the public record is necessary to support what appears to be 2416
a justiciable claim of the person. 2417

action, a well-informed public office or person responsible for 2514
the requested public records reasonably would believe that the 2515

division (B) of this section; 2519
(b) That a well-informed public office or person 2520
responsible for the requested public records reasonably would 2521
believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of the public 2522
office or person responsible for the requested public records 2523
would serve the public policy that underlies the authority that 2524
is asserted as permitting that conduct or threatened conduct. 2525
(3) In a mandamus action filed under division (C)(1) of 2526
this section, the following apply: 2527
(a)(i) If the court orders the public office or the person 2528
responsible for the public record to comply with division (B) of 2529
this section, the court shall determine and award to the relator 2530
all court costs, which shall be construed as remedial and not 2531
punitive. 2532
(ii) If the court makes a determination described in 2533
division (C)(3)(b)(iii) of this section, the court shall 2534
determine and award to the relator all court costs, which shall 2535
be construed as remedial and not punitive. 2536
(b) If the court renders a judgment that orders the public 2537
office or the person responsible for the public record to comply 2538
H. B. No. 72 Page 87
As Introduced
with division (B) of this section or if the court determines any 2539
of the following, the court may award reasonable attorney's fees 2540
to the relator, subject to division (C)(4) of this section: 2541
(i) The public office or the person responsible for the 2542
public records failed to respond affirmatively or negatively to 2543
the public records request in accordance with the time allowed 2544
under division (B) of this section. 2545
(ii) The public office or the person responsible for the 2546
public records promised to permit the relator to inspect or 2547
receive copies of the public records requested within a 2548
specified period of time but failed to fulfill that promise 2549
within that specified period of time. 2550
(iii) The public office or the person responsible for the 2551
public records acted in bad faith when the office or person 2552
voluntarily made the public records available to the relator for 2553
the first time after the relator commenced the mandamus action, 2554
but before the court issued any order concluding whether or not 2555
the public office or person was required to comply with division 2556
(B) of this section. No discovery may be conducted on the issue 2557
of the alleged bad faith of the public office or person 2558
responsible for the public records. This division shall not be 2559
construed as creating a presumption that the public office or 2560
the person responsible for the public records acted in bad faith 2561
when the office or person voluntarily made the public records 2562
available to the relator for the first time after the relator 2563
commenced the mandamus action, but before the court issued any 2564
order described in this division. 2565
(c) The court shall not award attorney's fees to the 2566
relator if the court determines both of the following: 2567
H. B. No. 72 Page 88
As Introduced
(i) That, based on the ordinary application of statutory 2568
law and case law as it existed at the time of the conduct or 2569
threatened conduct of the public office or person responsible 2570
for the requested public records that allegedly constitutes a 2571
failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 2572
(B) of this section and that was the basis of the mandamus 2573
action, a well-informed public office or person responsible for 2574
the requested public records reasonably would believe that the 2575
conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or person 2576
responsible for the requested public records did not constitute 2577
a failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with 2578
division (B) of this section; 2579
(ii) That a well-informed public office or person 2580
responsible for the requested public records reasonably would 2581
believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of the public 2582
office or person responsible for the requested public records 2583
would serve the public policy that underlies the authority that 2584
is asserted as permitting that conduct or threatened conduct. 2585
(4) All of the following apply to any award of reasonable 2586
attorney's fees awarded under division (C)(3)(b) of this 2587

Section 94:
section: 2588
(a) The fees shall be construed as remedial and not 2589
punitive. 2590

(c) Reasonable attorney's fees shall include reasonable 2595
fees incurred to produce proof of the reasonableness and amount 2596
H. B. No. 72 Page 89

of the fees and to otherwise litigate entitlement to the fees. 2597
(d) The court may reduce the amount of fees awarded if the 2598
court determines that, given the factual circumstances involved 2599
with the specific public records request, an alternative means 2600
should have been pursued to more effectively and efficiently 2601
resolve the dispute that was subject to the mandamus action 2602
filed under division (C)(1) of this section. 2603
(5) If the court does not issue a writ of mandamus under 2604
division (C) of this section and the court determines at that 2605
time that the bringing of the mandamus action was frivolous 2606
conduct as defined in division (A) of section 2323.51 of the 2607
Revised Code, the court may award to the public office all court 2608
costs, expenses, and reasonable attorney's fees, as determined 2609
by the court. 2610
(D) Chapter 1347. of the Revised Code does not limit the 2611
provisions of this section. 2612
(E)(1) To ensure that all employees of public offices are 2613
appropriately educated about a public office's obligations under 2614
division (B) of this section, all elected officials or their 2615
appropriate designees shall attend training approved by the 2616
attorney general as provided in section 109.43 of the Revised 2617
Code. A future official may satisfy the requirements of this 2618
division by attending the training before taking office, 2619
provided that the future official may not send a designee in the 2620
future official's place. 2621
(2) All public offices shall adopt a public records policy 2622
in compliance with this section for responding to public records 2623

public office will make available to a single person, may not 2630
limit the number of public records that it will make available 2631
during a fixed period of time, and may not establish a fixed 2632
period of time before it will respond to a request for 2633
inspection or copying of public records, unless that period is 2634
less than eight hours. 2635
The public office shall distribute the public records 2636
policy adopted by the public office under this division to the 2637
employee of the public office who is the records custodian or 2638
records manager or otherwise has custody of the records of that 2639
office. The public office shall require that employee to 2640
acknowledge receipt of the copy of the public records policy. 2641
The public office shall create a poster that describes its 2642
public records policy and shall post the poster in a conspicuous 2643
place in the public office and in all locations where the public 2644
office has branch offices. The public office may post its public 2645
records policy on the internet web site of the public office if 2646
the public office maintains an internet web site. A public 2647
office that has established a manual or handbook of its general 2648
policies and procedures for all employees of the public office 2649
shall include the public records policy of the public office in 2650
the manual or handbook. 2651

forward the copies for surveys, marketing, solicitation, or 2672
resale for commercial purposes. "Bulk commercial special 2673
extraction request" does not include a request by a person who 2674
gives assurance to the bureau that the person making the request 2675
does not intend to use or forward the requested copies for 2676
surveys, marketing, solicitation, or resale for commercial 2677

person may file a mandamus action pursuant to this section or a 2720
complaint with the clerk of the court of claims pursuant to 2721

Section 97:
section 2743.75 of the Revised Code, requesting the court to 2722
order the release of all or portions of the recording. If the 2723
court considering the request determines that the filing 2724
articulates by clear and convincing evidence that the public 2725
interest in the recording substantially outweighs privacy 2726
interests and other interests asserted to deny release, the 2727
court shall order the public office to release the recording. 2728
Sec. 149.436. Notwithstanding division (A)(1)(gg) (A)(1) 2729
(ff) of section 149.43 of the Revised Code, upon written request 2730

Sec. 2152.13. (A) A juvenile court shall impose a serious 2829
youthful dispositional sentence on a child when required under 2830
division (B)(3) of section 2152.121 of the Revised Code. In such 2831
a case, the remaining provisions of this division and divisions 2832
(B) and (C) do not apply to the child, and the court shall 2833
impose the mandatory serious youthful dispositional sentence 2834
H. B. No. 72 Page 97
As Introduced
under division (D)(1) of this section. 2835
In all other cases, a juvenile court may impose a serious 2836
youthful offender dispositional sentence on a child only if the 2837
prosecuting attorney of the county in which the delinquent act 2838
allegedly occurred initiates the process against the child in 2839
accordance with this division, and the child is an alleged 2840
delinquent child who is eligible for the dispositional sentence. 2841
The prosecuting attorney may initiate the process in any of the 2842
following ways: 2843
(1) Obtaining an indictment of the child as a serious 2844
youthful offender; 2845
(2) The child waives the right to indictment, charging the 2846
child in a bill of information as a serious youthful offender; 2847
(3) Until an indictment or information is obtained, 2848
requesting a serious youthful offender dispositional sentence in 2849
the original complaint alleging that the child is a delinquent 2850
child; 2851
(4) Until an indictment or information is obtained, if the 2852
original complaint does not request a serious youthful offender 2853
dispositional sentence, filing with the juvenile court a written 2854
notice of intent to seek a serious youthful offender 2855
dispositional sentence within twenty days after the later of the 2856
following, unless the time is extended by the juvenile court for 2857
good cause shown: 2858
(a) The date of the child's first juvenile court hearing 2859
regarding the complaint; 2860
(b) The date the juvenile court determines not to transfer 2861
the case under section 2152.12 of the Revised Code. 2862
H. B. No. 72 Page 98
As Introduced
After a written notice is filed under division (A)(4) of 2863
this section, the juvenile court shall serve a copy of the 2864
notice on the child and advise the child of the prosecuting 2865
attorney's intent to seek a serious youthful offender 2866
dispositional sentence in the case. 2867
(B) If an alleged delinquent child is not indicted or 2868
charged by information as described in division (A)(1) or (2) of 2869
this section and if a notice or complaint as described in 2870
division (A)(3) or (4) of this section indicates that the 2871
prosecuting attorney intends to pursue a serious youthful 2872
offender dispositional sentence in the case, the juvenile court 2873
shall hold a preliminary hearing to determine if there is 2874
probable cause that the child committed the act charged and is 2875
by age eligible for, or required to receive, a serious youthful 2876
offender dispositional sentence. 2877
(C)(1) A child for whom a serious youthful offender 2878
dispositional sentence is sought by a prosecuting attorney has 2879
the right to a grand jury determination of probable cause that 2880
the child committed the act charged and that the child is 2881
eligible by age for a serious youthful offender dispositional 2882
sentence. The grand jury may be impaneled by the court of common 2883
pleas or the juvenile court. 2884
Once a child is indicted, or charged by information or the 2885
juvenile court determines that the child is eligible for a 2886
serious youthful offender dispositional sentence, the child is 2887
entitled to an open and speedy trial by jury in juvenile court 2888
and to be provided with a transcript of the proceedings. The 2889
time within which the trial is to be held under Title XXIX of 2890
the Revised Code commences on whichever of the following dates 2891
is applicable: 2892
H. B. No. 72 Page 99
As Introduced
(a) If the child is indicted or charged by information, on 2893
the date of the filing of the indictment or information. 2894

requests a serious youthful offender dispositional sentence, on 2896
the date of the filing of the complaint. 2897
(c) If the child is not charged by an original complaint 2898
that requests a serious youthful offender dispositional 2899
sentence, on the date that the prosecuting attorney files the 2900
written notice of intent to seek a serious youthful offender 2901
dispositional sentence. 2902
(2) If the child is detained awaiting adjudication, upon 2903
indictment or being charged by information, the child has the 2904
same right to bail as an adult charged with the offense the 2905
alleged delinquent act would be if committed by an adult. Except 2906
as provided in division (D) of section 2152.14 of the Revised 2907
Code, all provisions of Title XXIX of the Revised Code and the 2908
Criminal Rules shall apply in the case and to the child. The 2909
juvenile court shall afford the child all rights afforded a 2910
person who is prosecuted for committing a crime including the 2911
right to counsel and the right to raise the issue of competency. 2912
The child may not waive the right to counsel. 2913
(D)(1) If a child is adjudicated a delinquent child for 2914
committing an act under circumstances that require the juvenile 2915
court to impose upon the child a serious youthful offender 2916
dispositional sentence under section 2152.11 of the Revised 2917
Code, all of the following apply: 2918
(a) The juvenile court shall impose upon the child a 2919
sentence available for the violation, as if the child were an 2920
adult, under Chapter 2929. of the Revised Code, except that the 2921
H. B. No. 72 Page 100
As Introduced
juvenile court shall not impose on the child a sentence of death 2922
or life imprisonment without parole. 2923
(b) The juvenile court also shall impose upon the child 2924
one or more traditional juvenile dispositions under sections 2925

Section 100:
2152.16, 2152.19, and 2152.20, and, if applicable, section 2926

Section 101:
2152.17 of the Revised Code. 2927
(c) The juvenile court shall stay the adult portion of the 2928
serious youthful offender dispositional sentence pending the 2929
successful completion of the traditional juvenile dispositions 2930
imposed. 2931
(2)(a) If a child is adjudicated a delinquent child for 2932
committing an act under circumstances that allow, but do not 2933
require, the juvenile court to impose on the child a serious 2934
youthful offender dispositional sentence under section 2152.11 2935
of the Revised Code, all of the following apply: 2936
(i) If the juvenile court on the record makes a finding 2937
that, given the nature and circumstances of the violation and 2938
the history of the child, the length of time, level of security, 2939
and types of programming and resources available in the juvenile 2940
system alone are not adequate to provide the juvenile court with 2941
a reasonable expectation that the purposes set forth in section 2942

Section 102:
2152.01 of the Revised Code will be met, the juvenile court may 2943
impose upon the child a sentence available for the violation, as 2944
if the child were an adult, under Chapter 2929. of the Revised 2945

Chapter 2925., 3719., or 4729. of the Revised Code for which a 4352
presumption in favor of a prison term is specified as being 4353
applicable if it makes both of the following findings: 4354
(a) A community control sanction or a combination of 4355
community control sanctions would adequately punish the offender 4356
and protect the public from future crime, because the applicable 4357
factors under section 2929.12 of the Revised Code indicating a 4358
lesser likelihood of recidivism outweigh the applicable factors 4359
under that section indicating a greater likelihood of 4360
recidivism. 4361
(b) A community control sanction or a combination of 4362
community control sanctions would not demean the seriousness of 4363
the offense, because one or more factors under section 2929.12 4364
of the Revised Code that indicate that the offender's conduct 4365
was less serious than conduct normally constituting the offense 4366
are applicable, and they outweigh the applicable factors under 4367
that section that indicate that the offender's conduct was more 4368
serious than conduct normally constituting the offense. 4369

presumption under division (D) of this section in favor of a 4374
prison term or of division (B) or (C) of this section in 4375
determining whether to impose a prison term for the offense 4376
shall be determined as specified in section 2925.02, 2925.03, 4377

regarding the violation. 4380
(2) If an offender who was convicted of or pleaded guilty 4381
to a felony violates the conditions of a community control 4382
sanction imposed for the offense solely by reason of producing 4383
positive results on a drug test, the court, as punishment for 4384
the violation of the sanction, shall not order that the offender 4385
be imprisoned unless the court determines on the record either 4386
of the following: 4387
(a) The offender had been ordered as a sanction for the 4388
felony to participate in a drug treatment program, in a drug 4389
education program, or in narcotics anonymous or a similar 4390
program, and the offender continued to use illegal drugs after a 4391

(b) The imprisonment of the offender for the violation is 4393
consistent with the purposes and principles of sentencing set 4394
forth in section 2929.11 of the Revised Code. 4395
(3) A court that sentences an offender for a drug abuse 4396
offense that is a felony of the third, fourth, or fifth degree 4397
may require that the offender be assessed by a properly 4398
credentialed professional within a specified period of time. The 4399
court shall require the professional to file a written 4400
assessment of the offender with the court. If the offender is 4401
eligible for a community control sanction and after considering 4402
the written assessment, the court may impose a community control 4403
sanction that includes addiction services and recovery supports 4404
included in a community-based continuum of care established 4405
under section 340.032 of the Revised Code. If the court imposes 4406
addiction services and recovery supports as a community control 4407
sanction, the court shall direct the level and type of addiction 4408
services and recovery supports after considering the assessment 4409

Revised Code, whichever is applicable, that the offender is 5663
eligible for placement in a program or prison of that nature, 5664
the department shall screen the offender and determine if there 5665
is an available program of shock incarceration or an intensive 5666
program prison for which the offender is suited. If there is an 5667
available program of shock incarceration or an intensive program 5668
prison for which the offender is suited, the department shall 5669

prison term of two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 5681
ten, or eleven years on an offender who is convicted of or 5682
pleads guilty to a violent felony offense if the offender also 5683
is convicted of or pleads guilty to a specification of the type 5684
described in section 2941.1424 of the Revised Code that charges 5685
that the offender is a violent career criminal and had a firearm 5686
on or about the offender's person or under the offender's 5687
control while committing the presently charged violent felony 5688
offense and displayed or brandished the firearm, indicated that 5689
the offender possessed a firearm, or used the firearm to 5690
facilitate the offense. The offender shall serve the prison term 5691
imposed under this division consecutively to and prior to the 5692
prison term imposed for the underlying offense. The prison term 5693
shall not be reduced pursuant to section 2929.20, division (A) 5694
(2) or (3) of section 2967.193 or 2967.194, or any other 5695

of this section and this division for acts committed as part of 5698
the same act or transaction. 5699

formerly a capital offense and that was committed prior to 5711
January 1, 1974, shall be prosecuted under the law as it existed 5712
at the time the offense was committed, and, if convicted, shall 5713
be imprisoned for life, except that whenever the statute under 5714
which any such person is prosecuted provides for a lesser 5715
penalty under the circumstances of the particular case, such 5716
lesser penalty shall be imposed. 5717
(B) Persons charged with an offense, other than an offense 5718
that was formerly a capital offense, that was committed prior to 5719
January 1, 1974, shall be prosecuted under the law as it existed 5720

penalty for commission of the substantially equivalent offense 5724
under Amended Substitute House Bill 511 of the 109th General 5725

does not have a substantial equivalent under that act, or if 5727
that act provides a more severe penalty than that originally 5728
prescribed for the offense of which the person is convicted, 5729
then sentence shall be imposed under the law as it existed prior 5730
to January 1, 1974. 5731
(C) Persons charged with an offense that is a felony of 5732
the third or fourth degree and that was committed on or after 5733

before July 1, 1983, shall be notified by the court sufficiently 5739
in advance of sentencing that they may choose to be sentenced 5740
pursuant to either the law in effect at the time of the 5741
commission of the offense or the law in effect at the time of 5742
sentencing. This notice shall be written and shall include the 5743
differences between and possible effects of the alternative 5744
sentence forms and the effect of the person's refusal to choose. 5745
The person to be sentenced shall then inform the court in 5746
writing of the person's choice, and shall be sentenced 5747
accordingly. Any person choosing to be sentenced pursuant to the 5748
law in effect at the time of the commission of an offense that 5749
is a felony of the third or fourth degree shall then be eligible 5750
for parole, and this person cannot at a later date have the 5751
person's sentence converted to a definite sentence. If the 5752

Sec. 2930.19. (A)(1) A victim, victim's representative, or 5768
victim's attorney, if applicable, or the prosecutor, on request 5769
of the victim, has standing as a matter of right to assert, or 5770
to challenge an order denying, the rights of the victim provided 5771
by law in any judicial or administrative proceeding. The trial 5772
court shall act promptly on a request to enforce, or on a 5773
challenge of an order denying, the rights of the victim. In any 5774
case, the trial court shall hear the matter within ten days of 5775
the assertion of the victim's rights. The reasons for any 5776
decision denying relief under this section shall be clearly 5777
stated on the record or in a judgment entry. 5778
(2)(a) If the trial court denies the relief sought under 5779
division (A)(1) of this section, the trial court shall do all of 5780
the following: 5781
(i) Provide the victim, the victim's representative, if 5782
applicable, the victim's attorney, if applicable, and the 5783
parties with notice of the decision and a copy of the judgment 5784
entry; 5785
(ii) Provide the victim, the victim's representative, if 5786
applicable, and the victim's attorney, if applicable, with the 5787
following statement along with the judgment entry: 5788
"NOTICE 5789
The victim, the victim's attorney, if applicable, or the 5790
prosecutor on request of the victim, may appeal this decision or 5791
petition to the court of appeals for an extraordinary writ. If 5792
such an interlocutory appeal or extraordinary writ is sought 5793
while the case is still pending in the trial court, it shall be 5794
initiated no later than fourteen days after notice of the 5795

decision was provided to the victim by telephone or electronic 5796
mail to the latest telephone number or electronic mail address 5797
provided by the victim. The prosecutor or the prosecutor's 5798
designee shall provide the notice to the victim and the notice 5799
shall be memorialized in a manner sufficient to prove to the 5800
court the prosecutor or prosecutor's designee sent the notice. 5801
The court shall dismiss any such interlocutory appeal or 5802
petition as untimely if it does not comply with this fourteen- 5803
day limit." 5804
(b)(i) If the court denies the relief sought, the victim 5805
or the victim's attorney, if applicable, or the prosecutor on 5806
request of the victim, may appeal or, if the victim has no 5807
remedy on appeal, petition the court of appeals or supreme court 5808
for an extraordinary writ, and the victim has standing to assert 5809
a right of limited appeal as it pertains to the decisions 5810
impacting the rights of the victim. An interlocutory appeal 5811
filed under this section shall be filed not later than fourteen 5812
days after notice was provided to the victim as described in 5813
division (A)(1) of this section, and such an appeal divests the 5814
trial court of jurisdiction of the portion of the case 5815
implicating the victim's rights until the interlocutory appeal 5816
is resolved by the appellate court. 5817
(ii) Upon the filing of an interlocutory appeal, the trial 5818
court shall transmit those portions of the transcript necessary 5819
for consideration of the issues to be reviewed by the court of 5820
appeals within five business days. Once the transcript is 5821
received by the court of appeals, the party that initiated the 5822
appeal shall have eight days to file a merit brief. Once the 5823
merit brief is filed, the appellee shall have eight days to file 5824
a response brief. The court of appeals shall decide the entire 5825
appeal not later than thirty-five days after the appeal is 5826

approval of the court, may stipulate to a different period of 5828
time for the briefing and issuance of the decision and judgment 5829
on the appeal. The victim, the victim's attorney, the 5830
prosecutor, or the defendant may notify the supreme court if a 5831
court of appeals has failed to issue a judgment in accordance 5832
with the stipulated period of time. Such notifications are 5833
public records. 5834
(iii) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as 5835
applying to a direct appeal that is filed after the court 5836
sentences the defendant. A victim who wishes to appeal from an 5837
order that is final on its entry after the court sentences the 5838
defendant shall file the notice of appeal within thirty days of 5839
that entry. 5840
(c) If the victim or victim's attorney, if applicable, 5841
petitions for an extraordinary writ, the court of appeals or the 5842
supreme court shall enter an order establishing an expedited 5843
schedule for the filing of an answer, the submission of 5844
evidence, the filing of briefing by the litigants, and the entry 5845
of decision and judgment and shall place the petition on its 5846
accelerated calendar. The court of appeals or the supreme court 5847
shall immediately notify the trial court of the petition, and 5848
the trial court shall transmit to the court of appeals or the 5849
supreme court those portions of the transcript necessary for the 5850
consideration of the issues to be reviewed by the applicable 5851
appellate court within five business days of the filing of the 5852
appeal or petition. The court shall enter judgment within forty- 5853
five days after the petition for an extraordinary writ is filed. 5854
Notwithstanding these limits, the litigants, with the approval 5855
of the court, may stipulate to a different period of time for 5856
the briefing and issuance of the decision and judgment in the 5857

action. The victim, the victim's attorney, the prosecutor, or 5858
the defendant may notify the supreme court if a court of appeals 5859
has failed to issue a judgment in accordance with the stipulated 5860
period of time. Such notifications are a public record. 5861
(d) If any interlocutory appeal is pursued to the supreme 5862
court, the supreme court shall enter an order establishing an 5863
expedited schedule for its proceedings, including, as 5864
applicable, the filing of jurisdictional memoranda and ruling 5865
thereon, the transmission of the record, the filing of briefing 5866
by the litigants, oral argument if permitted, and the entry of 5867
decision and judgment and shall place the appeal on its 5868
accelerated calendar. The court shall enter judgment within 5869
sixty days after the appeal is filed. The supreme court shall 5870
immediately notify the trial court of the appeal, and the trial 5871
court shall transmit to the court of appeals or the supreme 5872
court those portions of the transcript necessary for 5873
consideration of the issues to be reviewed by the applicable 5874
appellate court within five business days of the filing of the 5875
appeal. Notwithstanding these limits, the litigants, with the 5876
approval of the court, may stipulate to a different period of 5877
time for the supreme court's proceedings and for the issuance of 5878
the supreme court's decision and judgment in the case. 5879
(e) Nothing in this division applies to a direct appeal 5880
that is filed by the victim after the court sentences the 5881
defendant. A victim who wishes to appeal from an appellate entry 5882
shall file the appropriate notice of appeal to the supreme court 5883
within thirty days of the entry. 5884
(B)(1) A victim of a criminal offense or delinquent act 5885
has the right to be represented by an attorney. Nothing in this 5886

Section 234:
section creates a right to an attorney at public expense for a 5887

victim. If a victim is represented by an attorney, the court 5888
shall notify the victim's attorney in the same manner in which 5889
the parties are notified under applicable law or rule. The 5890
victim's attorney shall be included in all bench conferences, 5891
meetings in chambers, and sidebars with the trial court that 5892
directly involve a decision implicating that victim's rights as 5893
enumerated in Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 10a. Nothing 5894
in this section shall be construed as making a victim a party to 5895
the case. 5896
(2) A defendant has a right to respond and be represented 5897
by an attorney for appeals and writs the victim, the victim's 5898
attorney, if applicable, or the prosecutor may file pursuant to 5899
this section. An indigent defendant has the right to appointed 5900
counsel for appeals and writs filed pursuant to this section. 5901
If, as an indigent person, a defendant is unable to employ 5902
counsel, the defendant is entitled to have counsel provided 5903
pursuant to Chapter 120. of the Revised Code. The court shall 5904
notify the defendant and the defendant's attorney in the same 5905
manner that the parties are notified under applicable law or 5906
rule. 5907
(C) The failure of a public official or public agency or 5908
the public official's or public agency's designee to comply with 5909
the requirements of this chapter does not give rise to a claim 5910
for damages against that public official or public agency or 5911
that public official's or public agency's designee, except that 5912
a public agency as an employer may be held responsible for a 5913
violation of section 2930.18 of the Revised Code. 5914
(D) The failure of any person or entity to provide a 5915
right, privilege, or notice to a victim under this chapter does 5916
not constitute grounds for declaring a mistrial or new trial, 5917
H. B. No. 72 Page 201
As Introduced
for setting aside a conviction, sentence, adjudication, or 5918
disposition, or for granting postconviction release to a 5919
defendant or alleged juvenile offender. 5920
(E) If there is a conflict between a provision in this 5921
chapter and a specific statute governing the procedure in a case 5922
involving a capital offense, the specific statute supersedes the 5923
provision in this chapter. 5924
(F) A defendant or juvenile offender may not raise the 5925
failure to afford a right to a victim as error in any legal 5926
argument to provide an advantage to that defendant or juvenile 5927
offender in any motion, including a dispositive motion, motion 5928
for a mistrial, motion for new trial, or motion to have a 5929
conviction, sentence, or disposition set aside, in any petition 5930
for post-conviction relief, or in any assignment of error on 5931
appeal. 5932
(G)(F) If the victim of a criminal offense or delinquent 5933
act is incarcerated in a state or local correctional facility or 5934
is in the legal custody of the department of youth services, the 5935
victim's rights under this chapter may be modified by court 5936
order to prevent any security risk, hardship, or undue burden 5937
upon a public official or public agency with a duty under this 5938
chapter. 5939
(H)(G) As used in this section, "post-conviction release" 5940
means judicial release, early release, and parole, but does not 5941
mean relief pursuant to a federal petition in habeas corpus. 5942
Sec. 2937.222. (A) On the motion of the prosecuting 5943
attorney or on the judge's own motion, the judge shall hold a 5944
hearing to determine whether an accused person charged with 5945
aggravated murder when it is not a capital offense, murder, a 5946

felony of the first or second degree, a violation of section 5947

Section 235:
2903.06 of the Revised Code, a violation of section 2903.211 of 5948
the Revised Code that is a felony, or a felony OVI offense shall 5949
be denied bail. The judge shall order that the accused be 5950
detained until the conclusion of the hearing. Except for good 5951
cause, a continuance on the motion of the state shall not exceed 5952
three court days. Except for good cause, a continuance on the 5953
motion of the accused shall not exceed five court days unless 5954
the motion of the accused waives in writing the five-day limit 5955
and states in writing a specific period for which the accused 5956
requests a continuance. A continuance granted upon a motion of 5957
the accused that waives in writing the five-day limit shall not 5958
exceed five court days after the period of continuance requested 5959
in the motion. 5960
At the hearing, the accused has the right to be 5961
represented by counsel and, if the accused is indigent, to have 5962
counsel appointed. The judge shall afford the accused an 5963
opportunity to testify, to present witnesses and other 5964
information, and to cross-examine witnesses who appear at the 5965
hearing. The rules concerning admissibility of evidence in 5966
criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and 5967
consideration of information at the hearing. Regardless of 5968
whether the hearing is being held on the motion of the 5969
prosecuting attorney or on the court's own motion, the state has 5970
the burden of proving that the proof is evident or the 5971
presumption great that the accused committed the offense with 5972
which the accused is charged, of proving that the accused poses 5973
a substantial risk of serious physical harm to any person or to 5974
the community, and of proving that no release conditions will 5975
reasonably assure the safety of that person and the community. 5976
The judge may reopen the hearing at any time before trial 5977
H. B. No. 72 Page 203
As Introduced
if the judge finds that information exists that was not known to 5978
the movant at the time of the hearing and that that information 5979
has a material bearing on whether bail should be denied. If a 5980
municipal court or county court enters an order denying bail, a 5981
judge of the court of common pleas having jurisdiction over the 5982
case may continue that order or may hold a hearing pursuant to 5983
this section to determine whether to continue that order. 5984
(B) No accused person shall be denied bail pursuant to 5985
this section unless the judge finds by clear and convincing 5986
evidence that the proof is evident or the presumption great that 5987
the accused committed the offense described in division (A) of 5988
this section with which the accused is charged, finds by clear 5989
and convincing evidence that the accused poses a substantial 5990
risk of serious physical harm to any person or to the community, 5991
and finds by clear and convincing evidence that no release 5992
conditions will reasonably assure the safety of that person and 5993
the community. 5994
(C) The judge, in determining whether the accused person 5995
described in division (A) of this section poses a substantial 5996
risk of serious physical harm to any person or to the community 5997
and whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably 5998
assure the safety of that person and the community, shall 5999
consider all available information regarding all of the 6000
following: 6001
(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense charged, 6002
including whether the offense is an offense of violence or 6003
involves alcohol or a drug of abuse; 6004
(2) The weight of the evidence against the accused; 6005
(3) The history and characteristics of the accused, 6006

(a) The character, physical and mental condition, family 6008
ties, employment, financial resources, length of residence in 6009
the community, community ties, past conduct, history relating to 6010
drug or alcohol abuse, and criminal history of the accused; 6011
(b) Whether, at the time of the current alleged offense or 6012
at the time of the arrest of the accused, the accused was on 6013
probation, parole, post-release control, or other release 6014
pending trial, sentencing, appeal, or completion of sentence for 6015
the commission of an offense under the laws of this state, 6016
another state, or the United States or under a municipal 6017
ordinance. 6018
(4) The nature and seriousness of the danger to any person 6019
or the community that would be posed by the person's release. 6020
(D)(1) An order of the court of common pleas denying bail 6021
pursuant to this section is a final appealable order. In an 6022
appeal pursuant to division (D) of this section, the court of 6023
appeals shall do all of the following: 6024
(a) Give the appeal priority on its calendar; 6025
(b) Liberally modify or dispense with formal requirements 6026
in the interest of a speedy and just resolution of the appeal; 6027
(c) Decide the appeal expeditiously; 6028
(d) Promptly enter its judgment affirming or reversing the 6029
order denying bail. 6030
(2) The pendency of an appeal under this section does not 6031
deprive the court of common pleas of jurisdiction to conduct 6032
further proceedings in the case or to further consider the order 6033
denying bail in accordance with this section. If, during the 6034
H. B. No. 72 Page 205

pendency of an appeal under division (D) of this section, the 6035
court of common pleas sets aside or terminates the order denying 6036
bail, the court of appeals shall dismiss the appeal. 6037
(E) As used in this section: 6038
(1) "Court day" has the same meaning as in section 5122.01 6039
of the Revised Code. 6040
(2) "Felony OVI offense" means a third degree felony OVI 6041
offense and a fourth degree felony OVI offense. 6042
(3) "Fourth degree felony OVI offense" and "third degree 6043
felony OVI offense" have the same meanings as in section 2929.01 6044
of the Revised Code. 6045
Sec. 2941.021. Any criminal offense which is not 6046
punishable by death or life imprisonment may be prosecuted by 6047
information filed in the common pleas court by the prosecuting 6048
attorney if the defendant, after he has having been advised by 6049
the court of the nature of the charge against him the defendant 6050
and of his the defendant's rights under the constitution, is 6051
represented by counsel or has affirmatively waived counsel by 6052
waiver in writing and in open court, waives in writing and in 6053
open court prosecution by indictment. 6054
Sec. 2941.14. (A) In an indictment for aggravated murder, 6055
murder, or voluntary or involuntary manslaughter, the manner in 6056
which, or the means by which the death was caused need not be 6057
set forth. 6058
(B) Imposition of the death penalty for aggravated murder 6059
is precluded unless the indictment or count in the indictment 6060
charging the offense specifies one or more of the aggravating 6061
circumstances listed in division (A) of section 2929.04 of the 6062
Revised Code. If more than one aggravating circumstance is 6063

separately numbered specification, and if an aggravating 6065
circumstance is specified to a count in an indictment containing 6066
more than one count, such specification shall be identified as 6067

(C) A specification to an indictment or count in an 6069
indictment charging aggravated murder shall be stated at the end 6070
of the body of the indictment or count, and may be in 6071
substantially the following form: 6072

Revised Code, the commission shall notify the board of county 6281
commissioners of the county that the county system for paying 6282

the defendant's right to trial by jury and elects to be tried by 6290
the court under section 2945.05 of the Revised Code, any judge 6291
of the court in which the cause is pending shall proceed to 6292
hear, try, and determine the cause in accordance with the rules 6293
and in like manner as if the cause were being tried before a 6294
jury. If the accused is charged with an offense punishable with 6295
death, he shall be tried by a court to be composed of three 6296
judges, consisting of the judge presiding at the time in the 6297
trial of criminal cases and two other judges to be designated by 6298
the presiding judge or chief justice of that court, and in case 6299
there is neither a presiding judge nor a chief justice, by the 6300
chief justice of the supreme court. The judges or a majority of 6301
them may decide all questions of fact and law arising upon the 6302
trial; however the accused shall not be found guilty or not 6303
guilty of any offense unless the judges unanimously find the 6304
accused guilty or not guilty. If the accused pleads guilty of 6305
H. B. No. 72 Page 214
As Introduced
aggravated murder, a court composed of three judges shall 6306
examine the witnesses, determine whether the accused is guilty 6307
of aggravated murder or any other offense, and pronounce 6308
sentence accordingly. The court shall follow the procedures 6309
contained in sections 2929.03 and 2929.04 of the Revised Code in 6310
all cases in which the accused is charged with an offense 6311
punishable by death. If in the composition of the court it is 6312
necessary that a judge from another county be assigned by the 6313
chief justice, the judge from another county shall be 6314
compensated for his services as provided by section 141.07 of 6315
the Revised Code. 6316

state the defense, and may briefly state the evidence which the 6324
defendant or the defendant's counsel expects to offer in support 6325
of it. 6326
(C) The state must first produce its evidence and the 6327
defendant shall then produce the defendant's evidence. 6328
(D) The state will then be confined to rebutting evidence, 6329
but the court, for good reason, in furtherance of justice, may 6330
permit evidence to be offered by either side out of its order. 6331

to the jury before orally instructing the jury, and shall permit 6337
the jury to retain and consult the instructions during the 6338
court's presentation of the oral instructions and during the 6339
jury's deliberations. 6340
(2) In a case that is not a capital case, either party may 6341
request instructions to the jury on the points of law, which 6342
instructions shall be reduced to writing if either party 6343
requests it. 6344
(F) When the evidence is concluded, unless the case is 6345
submitted without argument, the counsel for the state shall 6346
commence, the defendant or the defendant's counsel follow, and 6347
the counsel for the state conclude the argument to the jury. 6348
(G) The court, after the argument is concluded and before 6349
proceeding with other business, shall forthwith charge the jury. 6350
Such charge shall be reduced to writing by the court if either 6351
party requests it before the argument to the jury is commenced. 6352
Such charge, or other charge or instruction provided for in this 6353

Section 251:
section, when so written and given, shall not be orally 6354
qualified, modified, or explained to the jury by the court. 6355
Written charges and instructions shall be taken by the jury in 6356
their retirement and returned with their verdict into court and 6357
remain on file with the papers of the case. 6358
The court may deviate from the order of proceedings listed 6359
in this section. 6360
Sec. 2945.13. When two or more persons are jointly 6361

the jurors in misdemeanor cases and, four of the jurors in 6370
felony cases other than capital cases that may subject the 6371
defendant to a sentence of life imprisonment, and six of the 6372
jurors in cases that may subject the defendant to a sentence of 6373
life imprisonment. If there is more than one defendant, each 6374
defendant may peremptorily challenge the same number of jurors 6375
as if he the defendant were the sole defendant. 6376
(2) Notwithstanding Criminal Rule 24, in capital cases in 6377
which there is only one defendant, each party, in addition to 6378
the challenges for cause authorized by law, may peremptorily 6379
challenge twelve of the jurors. If there is more than one 6380
defendant, each defendant may peremptorily challenge the same 6381
number of jurors as if he were the sole defendant. 6382
(3) In any case in which there are multiple defendants, 6383
the prosecuting attorney may peremptorily challenge a number of 6384
jurors equal to the total number of peremptory challenges 6385
allowed to all of the defendants. 6386
(B) If any indictments, informations, or complaints are 6387
consolidated for trial, the consolidated cases shall be 6388
considered, for purposes of exercising peremptory challenges, as 6389
though the defendants or offenses had been joined in the same 6390
indictment, information, or complaint. 6391
(C) The exercise of peremptory challenges authorized by 6392
H. B. No. 72 Page 217

case may be challenged for the following causes: 6396
(A) That the person was a member of the grand jury that 6397
found the indictment in the case; 6398
(B) That the person is possessed of a state of mind 6399
evincing enmity or bias toward the defendant or the state; but 6400
no person summoned as a juror shall be disqualified by reason of 6401
a previously formed or expressed opinion with reference to the 6402
guilt or innocence of the accused, if the court is satisfied, 6403
from examination of the juror or from other evidence, that the 6404
juror will render an impartial verdict according to the law and 6405
the evidence submitted to the jury at the trial; 6406
(C) In the trial of a capital offense, that the person 6407
unequivocally states that under no circumstances will the person 6408
follow the instructions of a trial judge and consider fairly the 6409
imposition of a sentence of death in a particular case. A 6410
prospective juror's conscientious or religious opposition to the 6411
death penalty in and of itself is not grounds for a challenge 6412
for cause. All parties shall be given wide latitude in voir dire 6413
questioning in this regard. 6414
(D) That the person is related by consanguinity or 6415
affinity within the fifth degree to the person alleged to be 6416

as a witness in the case; 6427
(H) (G) That the person has chronic alcoholism, or a drug 6428
dependency; 6429
(I) (H) That the person has been convicted of a crime that 6430
by law disqualifies the person from serving on a jury; 6431
(J) (I) That the person has an action pending between the 6432
person and the state or the defendant; 6433
(K) (J) That the person or the person's spouse is a party 6434

the person; 6437

injured or attempted to be injured by the offense charged, or is 6439
the person on whose complaint the prosecution was instituted, or 6440
the defendant; 6441
(M) (L) That the person is the employer or employee, or 6442
the spouse, parent, son, or daughter of the employer or 6443

must be kept together in a convenient place under the charge of 6454
an officer until they agree upon a verdict, or are discharged by 6455
the court. The court, except in cases where the offense charged 6456
may be punishable by death, may permit the jurors to separate 6457
during the adjournment of court overnight, under proper 6458
cautions, or under supervision of an officer. Such officer shall 6459
not permit a communication to be made to them, nor make any 6460
himself communication to them except to ask if they have agreed 6461
upon a verdict, unless he the officer does so by order of the 6462
court. Such officer shall not communicate to any person, before 6463
the verdict is delivered, any matter in relation to their 6464
deliberation. Upon the trial of any prosecution for misdemeanor, 6465

deliberation, or upon adjournment of the court overnight. 6467
In cases where the offense charged may be punished by 6468
death, after the case is finally submitted to the jury, the 6469
jurors shall be kept in charge of the proper officer and proper 6470
arrangements for their care and maintenance shall be made as 6471

to stand trial is raised and if the court, upon conducting the 6474
hearing provided for in section 2945.37 of the Revised Code, 6475

offense but has been charged with a misdemeanor offense of 6575
violence and after taking into consideration all relevant 6576

the defendant is incompetent to stand trial, the prosecutor in 6578
the case may recommend that the court follow the procedures 6579
prescribed in division (B)(1)(a)(v) of this section. If the 6580
prosecutor does not make such a recommendation, the court shall 6581
follow the procedures in division (B)(1)(a)(i) of this section. 6582
(b)(i) The court order for the defendant to undergo 6583
treatment or continuing evaluation and treatment under division 6584

defendant to undergo treatment or continuing evaluation and 6606
treatment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall specify 6607
that the defendant, if determined to require treatment or 6608
continuing evaluation and treatment for an intellectual 6609

being qualified to treat intellectual disabilities, at a public 6614
or private intellectual disabilities facility, or by a 6615
psychiatrist or another intellectual disabilities professional. 6616
In any case, the order may restrict the defendant's freedom of 6617
movement as the court considers necessary. The prosecutor in the 6618
defendant's case shall send to the chief clinical officer of the 6619
hospital, facility, or agency where the defendant is placed by 6620
the department of mental health and addiction services, or to 6621

or jail, or the person to which the defendant is committed, 6623
copies of relevant police reports and other background 6624
information that pertains to the defendant and is available to 6625
the prosecutor unless the prosecutor determines that the release 6626
of any of the information in the police reports or any of the 6627
other background information to unauthorized persons would 6628
interfere with the effective prosecution of any person or would 6629
create a substantial risk of harm to any person. 6630
H. B. No. 72 Page 225
As Introduced
(iii) In determining the place of commitment, the court 6631
shall consider the extent to which the person is a danger to the 6632
person and to others, the need for security, the availability of 6633
housing and supportive services, including outpatient mental 6634
health services in the community, and the type of crime involved 6635
and shall order the least restrictive alternative available that 6636
is consistent with public safety and treatment goals. In 6637
weighing these factors, the court shall give preference to 6638
protecting public safety and the availability of housing and 6639
supportive services. 6640
(c) If the defendant is found incompetent to stand trial, 6641
if the chief clinical officer of the hospital, facility, or 6642

which the defendant is committed for treatment or continuing 6645
evaluation and treatment under division (B)(1)(b) of this 6646

Section 254:
section determines that medication is necessary to restore the 6647
defendant's competency to stand trial, and if the defendant 6648
lacks the capacity to give informed consent or refuses 6649
medication, the chief clinical officer of the hospital, 6650
facility, or agency where the defendant is placed, or the 6651
managing officer or director of the institution, facility, or 6652
jail, or the person to which the defendant is committed for 6653
treatment or continuing evaluation and treatment may petition 6654
the court for authorization for the involuntary administration 6655
of medication. The court shall hold a hearing on the petition 6656
within five days of the filing of the petition if the petition 6657
was filed in a municipal court or a county court regarding an 6658
incompetent defendant charged with a misdemeanor or within ten 6659
days of the filing of the petition if the petition was filed in 6660
a court of common pleas regarding an incompetent defendant 6661

to stand trial and that, even if the defendant is provided with 6666
a course of treatment, there is not a substantial probability 6667
that the defendant will become competent to stand trial within 6668
one year, the court shall order the discharge of the defendant, 6669
unless upon motion of the prosecutor or on its own motion, the 6670
court either seeks to retain jurisdiction over the defendant 6671

disability subject to institutionalization by court order. If an 6677
affidavit is filed in the probate court, the trial court shall 6678
send to the probate court copies of all written reports of the 6679
defendant's mental condition that were prepared pursuant to 6680

Section 255:

or after January 1, 1995, the judgment or final order may be 6968
appealed from the trial court directly to the supreme court as a 6969
matter of right. The supreme court in criminal cases shall not 6970
be required to determine as to the weight of the evidence, 6971
except that, in cases in which a sentence of death is imposed 6972
for an offense committed on or after January 1, 1995, and in 6973

an appeal from a mayor's court, the appellate court may affirm 6981
the judgment or reverse it, in whole or in part, or modify it, 6982

definite prison term allowed for the offense by division (A) of 7013

Section 265:
section 2929.14 or section 2929.142 of the Revised Code or, with 7014
respect to a non-life felony indefinite prison term, the longest 7015
minimum prison term allowed for the offense by division (A)(1) 7016
(a) or (2)(a) of section 2929.14 of the Revised Code, the 7017
maximum definite prison term or longest minimum prison term was 7018
not required for the offense pursuant to Chapter 2925. or any 7019
other provision of the Revised Code, and the court imposed the 7020
sentence under one of the following circumstances: 7021
(a) The sentence was imposed for only one offense. 7022
H. B. No. 72 Page 238
As Introduced
(b) The sentence was imposed for two or more offenses 7023
arising out of a single incident, and the court imposed the 7024
maximum definite prison term or longest minimum prison term for 7025
the offense of the highest degree. 7026
(2) The sentence consisted of or included a prison term 7027
and the offense for which it was imposed is a felony of the 7028
fourth or fifth degree or is a felony drug offense that is a 7029
violation of a provision of Chapter 2925. of the Revised Code 7030
and that is specified as being subject to division (B) of 7031

Section 266:
section 2929.13 of the Revised Code for purposes of sentencing. 7032
If the court specifies that it found one or more of the factors 7033
in division (B)(1)(b) of section 2929.13 of the Revised Code to 7034
apply relative to the defendant, the defendant is not entitled 7035

imposed upon the offender. 7037
(3) The person was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a 7038
violent sex offense or a designated homicide, assault, or 7039
kidnapping offense, was adjudicated a sexually violent predator 7040
in relation to that offense, and was sentenced pursuant to 7041
division (A)(3) of section 2971.03 of the Revised Code, if the 7042
minimum term of the indefinite term imposed pursuant to division 7043
(A)(3) of section 2971.03 of the Revised Code is the longest 7044
term available for the offense from among the range of definite 7045
terms listed in section 2929.14 of the Revised Code or, with 7046
respect to a non-life felony indefinite prison term, the longest 7047
minimum prison term allowed for the offense by division (A)(1) 7048
(a) or (2)(a) of section 2929.14 of the Revised Code. As used in 7049
this division, "designated homicide, assault, or kidnapping 7050
offense" and "violent sex offense" have the same meanings as in 7051

Section 267:
section 2971.01 of the Revised Code. As used in this division, 7052

the same circumstances as are described in that section. 7056
(4) The sentence is contrary to law. 7057
(5) The sentence consisted of an additional prison term of 7058

convicted of or pleads guilty to a felony or, in the 7067
circumstances described in division (B)(3) of this section the 7068
modification of a sentence imposed upon such a defendant, on any 7069
of the following grounds: 7070

presumption favoring a prison term for the offense for which it 7072
was imposed, as set forth in section 2929.13 or Chapter 2925. of 7073
the Revised Code. 7074
(2) The sentence is contrary to law. 7075
(3) The sentence is a modification under section 2929.20 7076
of the Revised Code of a sentence that was imposed for a felony 7077
of the first or second degree. 7078
(C)(1) In addition to the right to appeal a sentence 7079
granted under division (A) or (B) of this section, a defendant 7080
who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a felony may seek leave 7081
to appeal a sentence imposed upon the defendant on the basis 7082
H. B. No. 72 Page 240
As Introduced
that the sentencing judge has imposed consecutive sentences 7083
under division (C)(3) of section 2929.14 of the Revised Code and 7084

respect to a non-life felony indefinite prison term, exceed the 7088
longest minimum prison term allowed by division (A)(1)(a) or (2) 7089
(a) of that section for the most serious such offense. Upon the 7090
filing of a motion under this division, the court of appeals may 7091
grant leave to appeal the sentence if the court determines that 7092
the allegation included as the basis of the motion is true. 7093
(2) A defendant may seek leave to appeal an additional 7094
sentence imposed upon the defendant pursuant to division (B)(2) 7095

additional sentence is for a definite prison term that is longer 7097
than five years. 7098
(D)(1) A sentence imposed upon a defendant is not subject 7099
to review under this section if the sentence is authorized by 7100
law, has been recommended jointly by the defendant and the 7101
prosecution in the case, and is imposed by a sentencing judge. 7102
(2) Except as provided in division (C)(2) of this section, 7103
a sentence imposed upon a defendant is not subject to review 7104
under this section if the sentence is imposed pursuant to 7105
division (B)(2)(b) of section 2929.14 of the Revised Code. 7106
Except as otherwise provided in this division, a defendant 7107
retains all rights to appeal as provided under this chapter or 7108
any other provision of the Revised Code. A defendant has the 7109
right to appeal under this chapter or any other provision of the 7110

pursuant to division (B)(3) of this section, the time limits 7121
specified in that rule shall not commence running until the 7122
court grants the motion that makes the sentence modification in 7123
question. A sentence appeal under this section shall be 7124
consolidated with any other appeal in the case. If no other 7125
appeal is filed, the court of appeals may review only the 7126
portions of the trial record that pertain to sentencing. 7127
(F) On the appeal of a sentence under this section, the 7128
record to be reviewed shall include all of the following, as 7129
applicable: 7130
(1) Any presentence, psychiatric, or other investigative 7131
report that was submitted to the court in writing before the 7132
sentence was imposed. An appellate court that reviews a 7133
presentence investigation report prepared pursuant to section 7134

Section 270:
2947.06 or 2951.03 of the Revised Code or Criminal Rule 32.2 in 7135
connection with the appeal of a sentence under this section 7136
shall comply with division (D)(3) of section 2951.03 of the 7137
Revised Code when the appellate court is not using the 7138
presentence investigation report, and the appellate court's use 7139

2951.03 of the Revised Code and does not cause that report to 7144
become a public record, as defined in section 149.43 of the 7145

the findings of the trier of fact required by division (B)(2)(e) 7158
of section 2929.14 of the Revised Code, relative to the 7159

vacate the sentence and remand the matter to the sentencing 7172
court for resentencing. The appellate court's standard for 7173
review is not whether the sentencing court abused its 7174
discretion. The appellate court may take any action authorized 7175
by this division if it clearly and convincingly finds either of 7176
the following: 7177

court's findings under division (B) or (D) of section 2929.13, 7179
division (B)(2)(e) or (C)(4) of section 2929.14, or division (I) 7180

this section may be appealed, by leave of court, to the supreme 7185
court. 7186
(I) As used in this section, "non-life felony indefinite 7187
prison term" has the same meaning as in section 2929.01 of the 7188
Revised Code. 7189
Sec. 2953.09. (A)(1) Upon filing an appeal in the supreme 7190
court, the execution of the sentence or judgment imposed in 7191
cases of felony is suspended. 7192
(2)(a)(2) If a notice of appeal is filed pursuant to the 7193
Rules of Appellate Procedure by a defendant who is convicted in 7194
a municipal or county court or a court of common pleas of a 7195
felony or misdemeanor under the Revised Code or an ordinance of 7196
a municipal corporation, the filing of the notice of appeal does 7197
not suspend execution of the sentence or judgment imposed. 7198
However, consistent with divisions (A)(2)(b), (B), and (C) of 7199
this section, section 2937.011 of the Revised Code, and 7200

amount and nature of any bail that is required. The bail shall 7205
at least be conditioned that the defendant will prosecute the 7206
appeal without delay and abide by the judgment and sentence of 7207
the court. 7208
(b)(i) A court of common pleas or court of appeals may 7209
suspend the execution of a sentence of death imposed for an 7210

a sentence of death imposed for an offense committed on or after 7217
January 1, 1995, only if no date for execution has been set by 7218
the supreme court, good cause is shown, the defendant files a 7219
motion requesting the suspension, and notice has been given to 7220
the prosecuting attorney of the appropriate county. 7221
(iii) A court of common pleas or court of appeals may 7222

felony in a capital case in which a sentence of death is not 7224
imposed only if no date for execution of the sentence has been 7225
set by the supreme court, good cause is shown for the 7226

prohibited by division (B) of this section from releasing on 7241
bail pursuant to division (A)(2)(a)(A)(2) of this section a 7242
defendant who is convicted of a bailable offense and not 7243
sentenced to imprisonment for life, the appropriate court of 7244

distinct bail or suspension of sentence authority. 7254
When an appeal in a case in which a sentence of death is 7255
imposed for an offense committed on or after January 1, 1995, is 7256
taken directly from the trial court to the supreme court, the 7257
supreme court has the same power and authority to suspend the 7258
execution of the sentence during the pendency of the appeal and 7259
admit the defendant to bail as does the court of appeals for 7260

justice requires to protect a party or person from oppression or 7381
undue burden or expense, including but not limited to the orders 7382
described in divisions (A)(1)(h)(i) to (viii) of this section. 7383
The court also may make any such order if, in its discretion, it 7384
determines that the discovery sought would be irrelevant to the 7385
claims made in the petition; and if the court makes any such 7386
order on that basis, it shall explain in the order the reasons 7387
why the discovery would be irrelevant. 7388
(h) If a petitioner, prosecuting attorney, or person from 7389

division (A)(1)(g) of this section and the order is denied in 7391
whole or in part, the court, on terms and conditions as are 7392
just, may order that any party or person provide or permit 7393

completing the discovery. 7431
(j) Nothing in division (A)(1)(e) of this section 7432

of the Revised Code, a petition under division (A)(1)(a)(i), 7441
(ii), or (iii) (A)(1)(a) of this section shall be filed no later 7442
than three hundred sixty-five days after the date on which the 7443
trial transcript is filed in the court of appeals in the direct 7444
appeal of the judgment of conviction or adjudication or, if the 7445
direct appeal involves a sentence of death, the date on which 7446
the trial transcript is filed in the supreme court. If no appeal 7447
is taken, except as otherwise provided in section 2953.23 of the 7448
Revised Code, the petition shall be filed no later than three 7449
hundred sixty-five days after the expiration of the time for 7450
filing the appeal. 7451

days after the effective date of this amendment 7455
(3)(a) In a petition filed under division (A)(1)(a)(i), 7456
(ii), or (iii) of this section, a person who has been sentenced 7457
to death may ask the court to render void or voidable the 7458
judgment with respect to the conviction of aggravated murder or 7459
the specification of an aggravating circumstance or the sentence 7460
of death. 7461
(b) A person sentenced to death who files a petition under 7462
division (A)(1)(a)(iv) of this section may ask the court to 7463
render void the sentence of death and to order the resentencing 7464
of the person under division (A) of section 2929.06 of the 7465
Revised Code. If a person sentenced to death files such a 7466
petition and asks the court to render void the sentence of death 7467
H. B. No. 72 Page 253
As Introduced
and to order the resentencing of the person under division (A) 7468
of section 2929.06 of the Revised Code, the act of filing the 7469
petition constitutes a waiver of any right to be sentenced under 7470
the law that existed at the time the offense was committed and 7471
constitutes consent to be sentenced to life imprisonment without 7472
parole under division (A) of section 2929.06 of the Revised 7473
Code. 7474
(4)(3) A petitioner shall state in the original or amended 7475
petition filed under division (A) of this section all grounds 7476
for relief claimed by the petitioner. Except as provided in 7477

Section 283:
section 2953.23 of the Revised Code, any ground for relief that 7478
is not so stated in the petition is waived. 7479
(5) (4) If the petitioner in a petition filed under 7480
division (A)(1)(a)(i), (ii), or (iii) (A)(1)(a) of this section 7481
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a felony, the petition may 7482
include a claim that the petitioner was denied the equal 7483
protection of the laws in violation of the Ohio Constitution or 7484
the United States Constitution because the sentence imposed upon 7485
the petitioner for the felony was part of a consistent pattern 7486
of disparity in sentencing by the judge who imposed the 7487
sentence, with regard to the petitioner's race, gender, ethnic 7488
background, or religion. If the supreme court adopts a rule 7489
requiring a court of common pleas to maintain information with 7490
regard to an offender's race, gender, ethnic background, or 7491
religion, the supporting evidence for the petition shall 7492
include, but shall not be limited to, a copy of that type of 7493
information relative to the petitioner's sentence and copies of 7494
that type of information relative to sentences that the same 7495
judge imposed upon other persons. 7496
(6) Notwithstanding any law or court rule to the contrary, 7497

there is no limit on the number of pages in, or on the length 7498
of, a petition filed under division (A)(1)(a)(i), (ii), (iii), 7499
or (iv) of this section by a person who has been sentenced to 7500
death. If any court rule specifies a limit on the number of 7501
pages in, or on the length of, a petition filed under division 7502
(A)(1)(a)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section or on a 7503
prosecuting attorney's response to such a petition by answer or 7504
motion and a person who has been sentenced to death files a 7505
petition that exceeds the limit specified for the petition, the 7506
prosecuting attorney may respond by an answer or motion that 7507
exceeds the limit specified for the response. 7508
(B) The clerk of the court in which the petition for 7509
postconviction relief and, if applicable, a request for 7510
postconviction discovery described in division (A)(1)(e) of this 7511

Section 284:
section is filed shall docket the petition and the request and 7512

immediately shall forward a copy of the petition and a copy of 7517
the request if filed by the petitioner to the prosecuting 7518
attorney of the county served by the court. If the request for 7519
postconviction discovery is filed by the prosecuting attorney, 7520
the clerk of the court immediately shall forward a copy of the 7521
request to the petitioner or the petitioner's counsel. 7522
(C) If a person who has been sentenced to death and who 7523
files a petition for postconviction relief under division (A)(1) 7524
(a)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section requests a 7525

deposition shall be conducted pursuant to divisions (B), (D), 7530
and (E) of Criminal Rule 15. Notwithstanding division (C) of 7531
Criminal Rule 15, the petitioner is not entitled to attend the 7532
deposition. The prosecuting attorney shall be permitted to 7533
attend and participate in any deposition. 7534
(D) The court shall consider a petition that is timely 7535
filed within the period specified in division (A)(2) of this 7536

Section 285:
section even if a direct appeal of the judgment is pending. 7537
Before granting a hearing on a petition filed under division (A) 7538
(1)(a)(i), or (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section, the court 7539
shall determine whether there are substantive grounds for 7540
relief. In making such a determination, the court shall 7541
consider, in addition to the petition, the supporting 7542
affidavits, and the documentary evidence, all the files and 7543
records pertaining to the proceedings against the petitioner, 7544
including, but not limited to, the indictment, the court's 7545
journal entries, the journalized records of the clerk of the 7546
court, and the court reporter's transcript. The court reporter's 7547
transcript, if ordered and certified by the court, shall be 7548
taxed as court costs. If the court dismisses the petition, it 7549
shall make and file findings of fact and conclusions of law with 7550
respect to such dismissal. If the petition was filed by a person 7551
who has been sentenced to death, the findings of fact and 7552
conclusions of law shall state specifically the reasons for the 7553
dismissal of the petition and of each claim it contains. 7554
(E) (D) Within ten days after the docketing of the 7555
petition, or within any further time that the court may fix for 7556
good cause shown, the prosecuting attorney shall respond by 7557

respect to the prosecuting attorney's response. Within twenty 7559

days from the date the issues are raised, either party may move 7560
for summary judgment. The right to summary judgment shall appear 7561
on the face of the record. 7562
(F) (E) Unless the petition and the files and records of 7563
the case show the petitioner is not entitled to relief, the 7564
court shall proceed to a prompt hearing on the issues even if a 7565
direct appeal of the case is pending. If the court notifies the 7566
parties that it has found grounds for granting relief, either 7567
party may request an appellate court in which a direct appeal of 7568
the judgment is pending to remand the pending case to the court. 7569
With respect to a petition filed under division (A)(1)(a) 7570
(iv) of this section, the procedures and rules regarding 7571
introduction of evidence and burden of proof at the pretrial 7572
hearing that are set forth in divisions (C), (D), and (F) of 7573

Section 286:
section 2929.025 of the Revised Code apply in considering the 7574
petition. With respect to such a petition, the grounds for 7575
granting relief are that the person has been diagnosed with one 7576
or more of the conditions set forth in division (A)(1)(a) of 7577

Section 287:
section 2929.025 of the Revised Code and that, at the time of 7578
the aggravated murder that was the basis of the sentence of 7579
death, the condition or conditions significantly impaired the 7580
person's capacity in a manner described in division (A)(1)(b) of 7581
that section. 7582
(G) A petitioner who files a petition under division (A) 7583
(1)(a)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section may amend the 7584
petition as follows: 7585
(1) If the petition was filed by a person who has been 7586
sentenced to death, at any time that is not later than one 7587
hundred eighty days after the petition is filed, the petitioner 7588
may amend the petition with or without leave or prejudice to the 7589

(2) If division (G)(1) of this section does not apply, at 7591
(F) At any time before the answer or motion is filed, the 7592
petitioner may amend the petition with or without leave or 7593
prejudice to the proceedings. 7594
(3) The petitioner may amend the petition with leave of 7595
court at any time after the expiration of the applicable period 7596
specified in division (G)(1) or (2) of this sectionthereafter. 7597
(H) (G) If the court does not find grounds for granting 7598
relief, it shall make and file findings of fact and conclusions 7599
of law and shall enter judgment denying relief on the petition. 7600
If the petition was filed by a person who has been sentenced to 7601
death, the findings of fact and conclusions of law shall state 7602
specifically the reasons for the denial of relief on the 7603
petition and of each claim it contains. If no direct appeal of 7604
the case is pending and the court finds grounds for relief or if 7605
a pending direct appeal of the case has been remanded to the 7606
court pursuant to a request made pursuant to division (F) (E) of 7607
this section and the court finds grounds for granting relief, it 7608
shall make and file findings of fact and conclusions of law and 7609
shall enter a judgment that vacates and sets aside the judgment 7610
in question, and, in the case of a petitioner who is a prisoner 7611
in custody, except as otherwise described in this division, 7612
shall discharge or resentence the petitioner or grant a new 7613
trial as the court determines appropriate. If the court finds 7614
grounds for relief in the case of a petitioner who filed a 7615
petition under division (A)(1)(a)(iv) of this section, the court 7616
shall render void the sentence of death and order the 7617
resentencing of the offender under division (A) of section 7618

Section 288:
2929.06 of the Revised Code. If the petitioner has been 7619
H. B. No. 72 Page 258
As Introduced
sentenced to death, the findings of fact and conclusions of law 7620
shall state specifically the reasons for the finding of grounds 7621
for granting the relief, with respect to each claim contained in 7622
the petition. The court also may make supplementary orders to 7623
the relief granted, concerning such matters as rearraignment, 7624
retrial, custody, and bail. If the trial court's order granting 7625
the petition is reversed on appeal and if the direct appeal of 7626
the case has been remanded from an appellate court pursuant to a 7627
request under division (F) (E) of this section, the appellate 7628
court reversing the order granting the petition shall notify the 7629
appellate court in which the direct appeal of the case was 7630
pending at the time of the remand of the reversal and remand of 7631
the trial court's order. Upon the reversal and remand of the 7632
trial court's order granting the petition, regardless of whether 7633
notice is sent or received, the direct appeal of the case that 7634
was remanded is reinstated. 7635
(I) Upon the filing of a petition pursuant to division (A) 7636
(1)(a)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section by a person 7637
sentenced to death, only the supreme court may stay execution of 7638
the sentence of death. 7639
(J)(1) If a person sentenced to death intends to file a 7640
petition under this section, the court shall appoint counsel to 7641
represent the person upon a finding that the person is indigent 7642
and that the person either accepts the appointment of counsel or 7643
is unable to make a competent decision whether to accept or 7644
reject the appointment of counsel. The court may decline to 7645
appoint counsel for the person only upon a finding, after a 7646
hearing if necessary, that the person rejects the appointment of 7647
counsel and understands the legal consequences of that decision 7648
or upon a finding that the person is not indigent. 7649
H. B. No. 72 Page 259
As Introduced
(2) The court shall not appoint as counsel under division 7650
(J)(1) of this section an attorney who represented the 7651
petitioner at trial in the case to which the petition relates 7652
unless the person and the attorney expressly request the 7653
appointment. The court shall appoint as counsel under division 7654
(J)(1) of this section only an attorney who is certified under 7655
Rule 20 of the Rules of Superintendence for the Courts of Ohio 7656
to represent indigent defendants charged with or convicted of an 7657
offense for which the death penalty can be or has been imposed. 7658
The ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during 7659
proceedings under this section does not constitute grounds for 7660
relief in a proceeding under this section, in an appeal of any 7661
action under this section, or in an application to reopen a 7662
direct appeal. 7663
(3) Division (J) of this section does not preclude 7664
attorneys who represent the state of Ohio from invoking the 7665
provisions of 28 U.S.C. 154 with respect to capital cases that 7666
were pending in federal habeas corpus proceedings prior to July 7667
1, 1996, insofar as the petitioners in those cases were 7668
represented in proceedings under this section by one or more 7669
counsel appointed by the court under this section or section 7670

Section 289:
120.06, 120.16, 120.26, or 120.33 of the Revised Code and those 7671
appointed counsel meet the requirements of division (J)(2) of 7672
this section. 7673
(K) (H) Subject to the appeal of a sentence for a felony 7674
that is authorized by section 2953.08 of the Revised Code, the 7675
remedy set forth in this section is the exclusive remedy by 7676
which a person may bring a collateral challenge to the validity 7677
of a conviction or sentence in a criminal case or to the 7678
validity of an adjudication of a child as a delinquent child for 7679
the commission of an act that would be a criminal offense if 7680

of the period prescribed in division (A) of that section or a 7686
second petition or successive petitions for similar relief on 7687
behalf of a petitioner unless division (A)(1) or (2) of this 7688

Section 290:
section applies: 7689
(1) Both of the following apply: 7690
(a) Either the petitioner shows that the petitioner was 7691
unavoidably prevented from discovery of the facts upon which the 7692
petitioner must rely to present the claim for relief, or, 7693
subsequent to the period prescribed in division (A)(2) of 7694

Section 291:
section 2953.21 of the Revised Code or to the filing of an 7695
earlier petition, the United States Supreme Court recognized a 7696
new federal or state right that applies retroactively to persons 7697
in the petitioner's situation, and the petition asserts a claim 7698
based on that right. 7699
(b) The petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence 7700
that, but for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable 7701
factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense 7702
of which the petitioner was convicted or, if the claim 7703
challenges a sentence of death that, but for constitutional 7704
error at the sentencing hearing, no reasonable factfinder would 7705
have found the petitioner eligible for the death sentence. 7706
(2) The petitioner was convicted of a felony, the 7707
petitioner is an offender for whom DNA testing was performed 7708

evidence related to the inmate's case as described in division 7712
(D) of section 2953.74 of the Revised Code, and the results of 7713
the DNA testing establish, by clear and convincing evidence, 7714
actual innocence of that felony offense or, if the person was 7715
sentenced to death, establish, by clear and convincing evidence, 7716
actual innocence of the aggravating circumstance or 7717
circumstances the person was found guilty of committing and that 7718

relevant and admissible with respect to the felony offense for 7800
which the offender is an eligible offender and is requesting the 7801
DNA testing, and had those results been analyzed in the context 7802
of and upon consideration of all available admissible evidence 7803
related to the offender's case as described in division (D) of 7804

Section 295:
section 2953.74 of the Revised Code, there is a strong 7805
probability that no reasonable factfinder would have found the 7806
offender guilty of that offense or, if the offender was 7807
sentenced to death relative to that offense, would have found 7808

establishes that biological material from the perpetrator of the 7839
crime was recovered from the crime scene and also clearly 7840
establishes whether or not the biological material is that of 7841
the eligible offender. A prior DNA test is not definitive if the 7842
eligible offender proves by a preponderance of the evidence that 7843
because of advances in DNA technology there is a possibility of 7844
discovering new biological material from the perpetrator that 7845
the prior DNA test may have failed to discover. Prior testing 7846
may have been a prior "definitive DNA test" as to some 7847
biological evidence but may not have been a prior "definitive 7848
DNA test" as to other biological evidence. 7849
Sec. 2953.72. (A) Any eligible offender who wishes to 7850
request DNA testing under sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the 7851

Revised Code, on a form prescribed by the attorney general for 7854
this purpose. The eligible offender shall submit the application 7855
H. B. No. 72 Page 266
As Introduced
in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 2953.73 7856
of the Revised Code. The eligible offender shall specify on the 7857
application the offense or offenses for which the offender is an 7858
eligible offender and is requesting the DNA testing. Along with 7859
the application, the eligible offender shall submit an 7860
acknowledgment that is on a form prescribed by the attorney 7861
general for this purpose and that is signed by the offender. The 7862
acknowledgment shall set forth all of the following: 7863
(1) That sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code 7864
contemplate applications for DNA testing of an eligible offender 7865
at a stage of a prosecution or case after the offender has been 7866
sentenced, that any exclusion or inclusion result of DNA testing 7867
rendered pursuant to those sections may be used by a party in 7868
any proceeding as described in section 2953.81 of the Revised 7869
Code, and that all requests for any DNA testing made at trial 7870
will continue to be handled by the prosecuting attorney in the 7871
case; 7872
(2) That the process of conducting postconviction DNA 7873
testing for an eligible offender under sections 2953.71 to 7874

Section 296:
2953.81 of the Revised Code begins when the offender submits an 7875
application under section 2953.73 of the Revised Code and the 7876
acknowledgment described in this section; 7877
(3) That the eligible offender must submit the application 7878
and acknowledgment to the court of common pleas that heard the 7879
case in which the offender was convicted of the offense for 7880
which the offender is an eligible offender and is requesting the 7881
DNA testing; 7882
(4) That the state has established a set of criteria set 7883
forth in section 2953.74 of the Revised Code by which eligible 7884
offender applications for DNA testing will be screened and that 7885
H. B. No. 72 Page 267
As Introduced
a judge of a court of common pleas upon receipt of a properly 7886
filed application and accompanying acknowledgment will apply 7887
those criteria to determine whether to accept or reject the 7888
application; 7889
(5) That the results of DNA testing conducted under 7890

Section 297:
sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code will be provided 7891
as described in section 2953.81 of the Revised Code to all 7892
parties in the postconviction proceedings and will be reported 7893
to various courts; 7894
(6) That, if DNA testing is conducted with respect to an 7895
offender under sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code, 7896
the state will not offer the offender a retest if an inclusion 7897
result is achieved relative to the testing and that, if the 7898
state were to offer a retest after an inclusion result, the 7899
policy would create an atmosphere in which endless testing could 7900
occur and in which postconviction proceedings could be stalled 7901
for many years; 7902
(7) That, if the court rejects an eligible offender's 7903
application for DNA testing because the offender does not 7904
satisfy the acceptance criteria described in division (A)(4) of 7905
this section, the court will not accept or consider subsequent 7906
applications; 7907
(8) That the acknowledgment memorializes the provisions of 7908

Section 298:
sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code with respect to 7909
the application of postconviction DNA testing to offenders, that 7910
those provisions do not give any offender any additional 7911
constitutional right that the offender did not already have, 7912
that the court has no duty or obligation to provide 7913
postconviction DNA testing to offenders, that the court of 7914
common pleas has the sole discretion subject to an appeal as 7915
H. B. No. 72 Page 268
As Introduced
described in this division to determine whether an offender is 7916
an eligible offender and whether an eligible offender's 7917
application for DNA testing satisfies the acceptance criteria 7918
described in division (A)(4) of this section and whether the 7919
application should be accepted or rejected, that if the court of 7920
common pleas rejects an eligible offender's application, the 7921
offender may seek leave of the supreme court to appeal the 7922
rejection to that court if the offender was sentenced to death 7923
for the offense for which the offender is requesting the DNA 7924
testing and, if the offender was not sentenced to death for that 7925
offense, may appeal the rejection to the court of appeals, and 7926
that no determination otherwise made by the court of common 7927
pleas in the exercise of its discretion regarding the 7928
eligibility of an offender or regarding postconviction DNA 7929
testing under those provisions is reviewable by or appealable to 7930
any court; 7931
(9) That the manner in which sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 7932
of the Revised Code with respect to the offering of 7933
postconviction DNA testing to offenders are carried out does not 7934
confer any constitutional right upon any offender, that the 7935
state has established guidelines and procedures relative to 7936
those provisions to ensure that they are carried out with both 7937
justice and efficiency in mind, and that an offender who 7938
participates in any phase of the mechanism contained in those 7939
provisions, including, but not limited to, applying for DNA 7940
testing and being rejected, having an application for DNA 7941
testing accepted and not receiving the test, or having DNA 7942
testing conducted and receiving unfavorable results, does not 7943
gain as a result of the participation any constitutional right 7944
to challenge, or, except as provided in division (A)(8) of this 7945

Section 299:
section, any right to any review or appeal of, the manner in 7946
H. B. No. 72 Page 269
As Introduced
which those provisions are carried out; 7947
(10) That the most basic aspect of sections 2953.71 to 7948

Section 300:
2953.81 of the Revised Code is that, in order for DNA testing to 7949
occur, there must be an offender sample against which other 7950
evidence may be compared, that, if an eligible offender's 7951
application is accepted but the offender subsequently refuses to 7952
submit to the collection of the sample of biological material 7953
from the offender or hinders the state from obtaining a sample 7954
of biological material from the offender, the goal of those 7955
provisions will be frustrated, and that an offender's refusal or 7956
hindrance shall cause the court to rescind its prior acceptance 7957
of the application for DNA testing for the offender and deny the 7958
application. 7959
(B) The attorney general shall prescribe a form to be used 7960
to make an application for DNA testing under division (A) of 7961
this section and section 2953.73 of the Revised Code and a form 7962
to be used to provide the acknowledgment described in division 7963
(A) of this section. The forms shall include all information 7964
described in division (A) of this section, spaces for an 7965
offender to insert all information necessary to complete the 7966
forms, including, but not limited to, specifying the offense or 7967
offenses for which the offender is an eligible offender and is 7968
requesting the DNA testing, and any other information or 7969
material the attorney general determines is necessary or 7970
relevant. The attorney general shall distribute copies of the 7971
prescribed forms to the department of rehabilitation and 7972
correction, the department shall ensure that each prison in 7973
which offenders are housed has a supply of copies of the forms, 7974
and the department shall ensure that copies of the forms are 7975
provided free of charge to any offender who requests them. 7976

certifies by electronic signature as prescribed by the state 1573
public defender that a financial disclosure form has been 1574
completed by the indigent person and is available for 1575

counsel in any case is not received by the state public defender 1577
within ninety days after the end of the calendar month in which 1578
the case is finally disposed of by the court, unless the county 1579

responsible for public records shall make copies of the 2267

H. B. No. 72 Page 78

within a reasonable period of time. If a public record contains 2269
information that is exempt from the duty to permit public 2270
inspection or to copy the public record, the public office or 2271
the person responsible for the public record shall make 2272
available all of the information within the public record that 2273
is not exempt. When making that public record available for 2274
public inspection or copying that public record, the public 2275
office or the person responsible for the public record shall 2276
notify the requester of any redaction or make the redaction 2277
plainly visible. A redaction shall be deemed a denial of a 2278
request to inspect or copy the redacted information, except if 2279
federal or state law authorizes or requires a public office to 2280
make the redaction. When the auditor of state receives a request 2281
to inspect or to make a copy of a record that was provided to 2282
the auditor of state for purposes of an audit, but the original 2283

public office or the person responsible for public records shall 2289
organize and maintain public records in a manner that they can 2290
be made available for inspection or copying in accordance with 2291
division (B) of this section. A public office also shall have 2292
available a copy of its current records retention schedule at a 2293
location readily available to the public. If a requester makes 2294
an ambiguous or overly broad request or has difficulty in making 2295
a request for copies or inspection of public records under this 2296
section such that the public office or the person responsible 2297
for the requested public record cannot reasonably identify what 2298
public records are being requested, the public office or the 2299

H. B. No. 72 Page 79
As Introduced
person responsible for the requested public record may deny the 2300
request but shall provide the requester with an opportunity to 2301
revise the request by informing the requester of the manner in 2302
which records are maintained by the public office and accessed 2303
in the ordinary course of the public office's or person's 2304
duties. 2305

whole, the public office or the person responsible for the 2307
requested public record shall provide the requester with an 2308
explanation, including legal authority, setting forth why the 2309
request was denied. If the initial request was provided in 2310
writing, the explanation also shall be provided to the requester 2311
in writing. The explanation shall not preclude the public office 2312
or the person responsible for the requested public record from 2313
relying upon additional reasons or legal authority in defending 2314
an action commenced under division (C) of this section. 2315
(4) Unless specifically required or authorized by state or 2316
federal law or in accordance with division (B) of this section, 2317
no public office or person responsible for public records may 2318
limit or condition the availability of public records by 2319
requiring disclosure of the requester's identity or the intended 2320
use of the requested public record. Any requirement that the 2321
requester disclose the requester's identity or the intended use 2322
of the requested public record constitutes a denial of the 2323
request. 2324
(5) A public office or person responsible for public 2325
records may ask a requester to make the request in writing, may 2326
ask for the requester's identity, and may inquire about the 2327
intended use of the information requested, but may do so only 2328
after disclosing to the requester that a written request is not 2329

H. B. No. 72 Page 80
As Introduced
mandatory, that the requester may decline to reveal the 2330
requester's identity or the intended use, and when a written 2331
request or disclosure of the identity or intended use would 2332
benefit the requester by enhancing the ability of the public 2333
office or person responsible for public records to identify, 2334
locate, or deliver the public records sought by the requester. 2335
(6) If any person requests a copy of a public record in 2336
accordance with division (B) of this section, the public office 2337
or person responsible for the public record may require the 2338
requester to pay in advance the cost involved in providing the 2339
copy of the public record in accordance with the choice made by 2340
the requester under this division. The public office or the 2341
person responsible for the public record shall permit the 2342
requester to choose to have the public record duplicated upon 2343
paper, upon the same medium upon which the public office or 2344
person responsible for the public record keeps it, or upon any 2345
other medium upon which the public office or person responsible 2346
for the public record determines that it reasonably can be 2347
duplicated as an integral part of the normal operations of the 2348
public office or person responsible for the public record. When 2349
the requester makes a choice under this division, the public 2350
office or person responsible for the public record shall provide 2351
a copy of it in accordance with the choice made by the 2352
requester. Nothing in this section requires a public office or 2353
person responsible for the public record to allow the requester 2354
of a copy of the public record to make the copies of the public 2355
record. 2356
(7)(a) Upon a request made in accordance with division (B) 2357
of this section and subject to division (B)(6) of this section, 2358
a public office or person responsible for public records shall 2359
transmit a copy of a public record to any person by United 2360

H. B. No. 72 Page 81
As Introduced
States mail or by any other means of delivery or transmission 2361
within a reasonable period of time after receiving the request 2362
for the copy. The public office or person responsible for the 2363
public record may require the person making the request to pay 2364
in advance the cost of postage if the copy is transmitted by 2365
United States mail or the cost of delivery if the copy is 2366
transmitted other than by United States mail, and to pay in 2367
advance the costs incurred for other supplies used in the 2368
mailing, delivery, or transmission. 2369
(b) Any public office may adopt a policy and procedures 2370
that it will follow in transmitting, within a reasonable period 2371
of time after receiving a request, copies of public records by 2372
United States mail or by any other means of delivery or 2373
transmission pursuant to division (B)(7) of this section. A 2374
public office that adopts a policy and procedures under division 2375
(B)(7) of this section shall comply with them in performing its 2376
duties under that division. 2377
(c) In any policy and procedures adopted under division 2378
(B)(7) of this section: 2379
(i) A public office may limit the number of records 2380
requested by a person that the office will physically deliver by 2381
United States mail or by another delivery service to ten per 2382
month, unless the person certifies to the office in writing that 2383
the person does not intend to use or forward the requested 2384
records, or the information contained in them, for commercial 2385
purposes; 2386
(ii) A public office that chooses to provide some or all 2387
of its public records on a web site that is fully accessible to 2388

download, or otherwise receive records provided on the web site, 2392

unless the person certifies to the office in writing that the 2396
person does not intend to use or forward the requested records, 2397
or the information contained in them, for commercial purposes. 2398

criminal investigation or prosecution or concerning what would 2408

investigation or prosecution were an adult, unless the request 2410
to inspect or to obtain a copy of the record is for the purpose 2411
of acquiring information that is subject to release as a public 2412
record under this section and the judge who imposed the sentence 2413
or made the adjudication with respect to the person, or the 2414
judge's successor in office, finds that the information sought 2415
in the public record is necessary to support what appears to be 2416
a justiciable claim of the person. 2417

damages set forth in this division if a court determines that 2489
the public office or the person responsible for public records 2490
failed to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 2491
(B) of this section. 2492
The amount of statutory damages shall be fixed at one 2493
hundred dollars for each business day during which the public 2494

award of statutory damages shall be in addition to all other 2503
remedies authorized by this section. 2504
The court may reduce an award of statutory damages or not 2505
award statutory damages if the court determines both of the 2506
following: 2507

H. B. No. 72 Page 86
As Introduced
threatened conduct of the public office or person responsible 2510
for the requested public records that allegedly constitutes a 2511
failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 2512
(B) of this section and that was the basis of the mandamus 2513
action, a well-informed public office or person responsible for 2514
the requested public records reasonably would believe that the 2515
conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or person 2516
responsible for the requested public records did not constitute 2517
a failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with 2518
division (B) of this section; 2519
(b) That a well-informed public office or person 2520
responsible for the requested public records reasonably would 2521
believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of the public 2522
office or person responsible for the requested public records 2523
would serve the public policy that underlies the authority that 2524
is asserted as permitting that conduct or threatened conduct. 2525
(3) In a mandamus action filed under division (C)(1) of 2526
this section, the following apply: 2527
(a)(i) If the court orders the public office or the person 2528
responsible for the public record to comply with division (B) of 2529
this section, the court shall determine and award to the relator 2530
all court costs, which shall be construed as remedial and not 2531
punitive. 2532
(ii) If the court makes a determination described in 2533
division (C)(3)(b)(iii) of this section, the court shall 2534
determine and award to the relator all court costs, which shall 2535

(b) If the court renders a judgment that orders the public 2537
office or the person responsible for the public record to comply 2538

As Introduced
with division (B) of this section or if the court determines any 2539

to the relator, subject to division (C)(4) of this section: 2541
(i) The public office or the person responsible for the 2542
public records failed to respond affirmatively or negatively to 2543
the public records request in accordance with the time allowed 2544
under division (B) of this section. 2545
(ii) The public office or the person responsible for the 2546
public records promised to permit the relator to inspect or 2547
receive copies of the public records requested within a 2548
specified period of time but failed to fulfill that promise 2549
within that specified period of time. 2550
(iii) The public office or the person responsible for the 2551
public records acted in bad faith when the office or person 2552
voluntarily made the public records available to the relator for 2553
the first time after the relator commenced the mandamus action, 2554
but before the court issued any order concluding whether or not 2555
the public office or person was required to comply with division 2556
(B) of this section. No discovery may be conducted on the issue 2557
of the alleged bad faith of the public office or person 2558
responsible for the public records. This division shall not be 2559
construed as creating a presumption that the public office or 2560
the person responsible for the public records acted in bad faith 2561
when the office or person voluntarily made the public records 2562
available to the relator for the first time after the relator 2563
commenced the mandamus action, but before the court issued any 2564
order described in this division. 2565
(c) The court shall not award attorney's fees to the 2566
relator if the court determines both of the following: 2567

(i) That, based on the ordinary application of statutory 2568
law and case law as it existed at the time of the conduct or 2569
threatened conduct of the public office or person responsible 2570
for the requested public records that allegedly constitutes a 2571
failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 2572
(B) of this section and that was the basis of the mandamus 2573
action, a well-informed public office or person responsible for 2574
the requested public records reasonably would believe that the 2575
conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or person 2576
responsible for the requested public records did not constitute 2577
a failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with 2578
division (B) of this section; 2579
(ii) That a well-informed public office or person 2580
responsible for the requested public records reasonably would 2581
believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of the public 2582
office or person responsible for the requested public records 2583
would serve the public policy that underlies the authority that 2584
is asserted as permitting that conduct or threatened conduct. 2585
(4) All of the following apply to any award of reasonable 2586
attorney's fees awarded under division (C)(3)(b) of this 2587
section: 2588
(a) The fees shall be construed as remedial and not 2589
punitive. 2590

(d) The court may reduce the amount of fees awarded if the 2598
court determines that, given the factual circumstances involved 2599
with the specific public records request, an alternative means 2600
should have been pursued to more effectively and efficiently 2601
resolve the dispute that was subject to the mandamus action 2602
filed under division (C)(1) of this section. 2603
(5) If the court does not issue a writ of mandamus under 2604
division (C) of this section and the court determines at that 2605
time that the bringing of the mandamus action was frivolous 2606
conduct as defined in division (A) of section 2323.51 of the 2607
Revised Code, the court may award to the public office all court 2608
costs, expenses, and reasonable attorney's fees, as determined 2609
by the court. 2610
(D) Chapter 1347. of the Revised Code does not limit the 2611
provisions of this section. 2612

appropriately educated about a public office's obligations under 2614
division (B) of this section, all elected officials or their 2615
appropriate designees shall attend training approved by the 2616
attorney general as provided in section 109.43 of the Revised 2617

provided that the future official may not send a designee in the 2620
future official's place. 2621

public office will make available to a single person, may not 2630
limit the number of public records that it will make available 2631
during a fixed period of time, and may not establish a fixed 2632
period of time before it will respond to a request for 2633
inspection or copying of public records, unless that period is 2634
less than eight hours. 2635
The public office shall distribute the public records 2636

the public office maintains an internet web site. A public 2647
office that has established a manual or handbook of its general 2648

shall include the public records policy of the public office in 2650
the manual or handbook. 2651

forward the copies for surveys, marketing, solicitation, or 2672
resale for commercial purposes. "Bulk commercial special 2673
extraction request" does not include a request by a person who 2674
gives assurance to the bureau that the person making the request 2675
does not intend to use or forward the requested copies for 2676
surveys, marketing, solicitation, or resale for commercial 2677

complaint with the clerk of the court of claims pursuant to 2721
section 2743.75 of the Revised Code, requesting the court to 2722
order the release of all or portions of the recording. If the 2723
court considering the request determines that the filing 2724
articulates by clear and convincing evidence that the public 2725
interest in the recording substantially outweighs privacy 2726
interests and other interests asserted to deny release, the 2727
court shall order the public office to release the recording. 2728

dispositional sentence within twenty days after the later of the 2856

dispositional sentence. 2902
(2) If the child is detained awaiting adjudication, upon 2903
indictment or being charged by information, the child has the 2904

youthful offender dispositional sentence under section 2152.11 2935
of the Revised Code, all of the following apply: 2936
(i) If the juvenile court on the record makes a finding 2937
that, given the nature and circumstances of the violation and 2938
the history of the child, the length of time, level of security, 2939
and types of programming and resources available in the juvenile 2940
system alone are not adequate to provide the juvenile court with 2941
a reasonable expectation that the purposes set forth in section 2942
2152.01 of the Revised Code will be met, the juvenile court may 2943
impose upon the child a sentence available for the violation, as 2944
if the child were an adult, under Chapter 2929. of the Revised 2945

(b) The person engaged in conduct that, if prosecuted, 3050
would constitute a felony, a misdemeanor that is an offense of 3051
violence, an attempt to commit a felony, or an attempt to commit 3052
a misdemeanor that is an offense of violence and that conduct 3053
was a proximate cause of the injury or loss for which relief is 3054
claimed in the tort action, regardless of whether the person has 3055
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to or has been charged with 3056
committing the felony, the misdemeanor, or the attempt to commit 3057

(c) The person suffered the injury or loss for which 3059

H. B. No. 72 Page 105

and that conduct, if prosecuted, would constitute a felony, a 3083
misdemeanor that is an offense of violence, an attempt to commit 3084
a felony, or an attempt to commit a misdemeanor that is an 3085
offense of violence, regardless of whether the person has been 3086

to civil claims based upon alleged intentionally tortious 3091

Chapter 2925., 3719., or 4729. of the Revised Code for which a 4352
presumption in favor of a prison term is specified as being 4353
applicable if it makes both of the following findings: 4354
(a) A community control sanction or a combination of 4355
community control sanctions would adequately punish the offender 4356
and protect the public from future crime, because the applicable 4357
factors under section 2929.12 of the Revised Code indicating a 4358
lesser likelihood of recidivism outweigh the applicable factors 4359
under that section indicating a greater likelihood of 4360
recidivism. 4361
(b) A community control sanction or a combination of 4362
community control sanctions would not demean the seriousness of 4363
the offense, because one or more factors under section 2929.12 4364
of the Revised Code that indicate that the offender's conduct 4365
was less serious than conduct normally constituting the offense 4366
are applicable, and they outweigh the applicable factors under 4367
that section that indicate that the offender's conduct was more 4368
serious than conduct normally constituting the offense. 4369
(E)(1) Except as provided in division (F) of this section, 4370
for any drug offense that is a violation of any provision of 4371

third, fourth, or fifth degree, the applicability of a 4373
presumption under division (D) of this section in favor of a 4374
prison term or of division (B) or (C) of this section in 4375
determining whether to impose a prison term for the offense 4376
shall be determined as specified in section 2925.02, 2925.03, 4377
2925.04, 2925.05, 2925.06, 2925.11, 2925.13, 2925.22, 2925.23, 4378

regarding the violation. 4380
(2) If an offender who was convicted of or pleaded guilty 4381
to a felony violates the conditions of a community control 4382
sanction imposed for the offense solely by reason of producing 4383
positive results on a drug test, the court, as punishment for 4384
the violation of the sanction, shall not order that the offender 4385
be imprisoned unless the court determines on the record either 4386
of the following: 4387
(a) The offender had been ordered as a sanction for the 4388
felony to participate in a drug treatment program, in a drug 4389
education program, or in narcotics anonymous or a similar 4390

reasonable period of participation in the program. 4392
(b) The imprisonment of the offender for the violation is 4393
consistent with the purposes and principles of sentencing set 4394
forth in section 2929.11 of the Revised Code. 4395
(3) A court that sentences an offender for a drug abuse 4396
offense that is a felony of the third, fourth, or fifth degree 4397
may require that the offender be assessed by a properly 4398
credentialed professional within a specified period of time. The 4399
court shall require the professional to file a written 4400
assessment of the offender with the court. If the offender is 4401
eligible for a community control sanction and after considering 4402
the written assessment, the court may impose a community control 4403
sanction that includes addiction services and recovery supports 4404
included in a community-based continuum of care established 4405
under section 340.032 of the Revised Code. If the court imposes 4406
addiction services and recovery supports as a community control 4407
sanction, the court shall direct the level and type of addiction 4408
services and recovery supports after considering the assessment 4409

2923.02 of the Revised Code, the sentencing court shall consider 4688

the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense, the 4696
sentencing court shall consider the factors applicable to the 4697
felony category that the drug abuse offense attempted would be 4698
if that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved 4699
an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance 4700
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance 4701
amounts than was involved in the attempt. 4702

except to the extent that they would by their nature be clearly 5628
inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs associated with a 5629
sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of the 5630
use of the monitoring device. 5631
(I) At the time of sentencing, the court may recommend the 5632
offender for placement in a program of shock incarceration under 5633
section 5120.031 of the Revised Code or for placement in an 5634
intensive program prison under section 5120.032 of the Revised 5635
Code, disapprove placement of the offender in a program of shock 5636
incarceration or an intensive program prison of that nature, or 5637
make no recommendation on placement of the offender. In no case 5638
shall the department of rehabilitation and correction place the 5639
offender in a program or prison of that nature unless the 5640
department determines as specified in section 5120.031 or 5641
5120.032 of the Revised Code, whichever is applicable, that the 5642
offender is eligible for the placement. 5643
If the court disapproves placement of the offender in a 5644
program or prison of that nature, the department of 5645

H. B. No. 72 Page 192
As Introduced
rehabilitation and correction shall not place the offender in 5646
any program of shock incarceration or intensive program prison. 5647
If the court recommends placement of the offender in a 5648
program of shock incarceration or in an intensive program 5649
prison, and if the offender is subsequently placed in the 5650
recommended program or prison, the department shall notify the 5651
court of the placement and shall include with the notice a brief 5652
description of the placement. 5653
If the court recommends placement of the offender in a 5654
program of shock incarceration or in an intensive program prison 5655
and the department does not subsequently place the offender in 5656
the recommended program or prison, the department shall send a 5657
notice to the court indicating why the offender was not placed 5658
in the recommended program or prison. 5659
If the court does not make a recommendation under this 5660
division with respect to an offender and if the department 5661
determines as specified in section 5120.031 or 5120.032 of the 5662
Revised Code, whichever is applicable, that the offender is 5663
eligible for placement in a program or prison of that nature, 5664
the department shall screen the offender and determine if there 5665
is an available program of shock incarceration or an intensive 5666
program prison for which the offender is suited. If there is an 5667
available program of shock incarceration or an intensive program 5668
prison for which the offender is suited, the department shall 5669
notify the court of the proposed placement of the offender as 5670
specified in section 5120.031 or 5120.032 of the Revised Code 5671
and shall include with the notice a brief description of the 5672
placement. The court shall have ten days from receipt of the 5673
notice to disapprove the placement. 5674

aggravated vehicular homicide in violation of division (A)(1) of 5676
section 2903.06 of the Revised Code and division (B)(2)(c) of 5677
that section applies, the person shall be sentenced pursuant to 5678
section 2929.142 of the Revised Code. 5679
(K)(1) The court shall impose an additional mandatory 5680
prison term of two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 5681
ten, or eleven years on an offender who is convicted of or 5682
pleads guilty to a violent felony offense if the offender also 5683
is convicted of or pleads guilty to a specification of the type 5684
described in section 2941.1424 of the Revised Code that charges 5685
that the offender is a violent career criminal and had a firearm 5686
on or about the offender's person or under the offender's 5687
control while committing the presently charged violent felony 5688
offense and displayed or brandished the firearm, indicated that 5689
the offender possessed a firearm, or used the firearm to 5690
facilitate the offense. The offender shall serve the prison term 5691
imposed under this division consecutively to and prior to the 5692
prison term imposed for the underlying offense. The prison term 5693
shall not be reduced pursuant to section 2929.20, division (A) 5694
(2) or (3) of section 2967.193 or 2967.194, or any other 5695
provision of Chapter 2967. or 5120. of the Revised Code. A court 5696
may not impose more than one sentence under division (B)(2)(a) 5697
of this section and this division for acts committed as part of 5698
the same act or transaction. 5699
(2) As used in division (K)(1) of this section, "violent 5700
career criminal" and "violent felony offense" have the same 5701
meanings as in section 2923.132 of the Revised Code. 5702

imprisonment without parole, a sentence of life imprisonment, a 5704
definite sentence, or a sentence to an indefinite prison term 5705

the offender was under eighteen years of age, the offender's 5707
parole eligibility shall be determined under section 2967.132 of 5708
the Revised Code. 5709
Sec. 2929.61. (A) Persons charged with an offense that was 5710
formerly a capital offense and that was committed prior to 5711
January 1, 1974, shall be prosecuted under the law as it existed 5712
at the time the offense was committed, and, if convicted, shall 5713
be imprisoned for life, except that whenever the statute under 5714
which any such person is prosecuted provides for a lesser 5715
penalty under the circumstances of the particular case, such 5716
lesser penalty shall be imposed. 5717
(B) Persons charged with an offense, other than an offense 5718
that was formerly a capital offense, that was committed prior to 5719
January 1, 1974, shall be prosecuted under the law as it existed 5720
at the time the offense was committed. Persons convicted or 5721
sentenced on or after January 1, 1974, for an offense committed 5722
prior to January 1, 1974, shall be sentenced according to the 5723
penalty for commission of the substantially equivalent offense 5724
under Amended Substitute House Bill 511 of the 109th General 5725
Assembly. If the offense for which sentence is being imposed 5726
does not have a substantial equivalent under that act, or if 5727
that act provides a more severe penalty than that originally 5728
prescribed for the offense of which the person is convicted, 5729
then sentence shall be imposed under the law as it existed prior 5730
to January 1, 1974. 5731
(C) Persons charged with an offense that is a felony of 5732
the third or fourth degree and that was committed on or after 5733

1983, for an offense that is a felony of the third or fourth 5737
degree and that was committed on or after January 1, 1974, and 5738
before July 1, 1983, shall be notified by the court sufficiently 5739
in advance of sentencing that they may choose to be sentenced 5740
pursuant to either the law in effect at the time of the 5741
commission of the offense or the law in effect at the time of 5742
sentencing. This notice shall be written and shall include the 5743
differences between and possible effects of the alternative 5744
sentence forms and the effect of the person's refusal to choose. 5745
The person to be sentenced shall then inform the court in 5746
writing of the person's choice, and shall be sentenced 5747
accordingly. Any person choosing to be sentenced pursuant to the 5748
law in effect at the time of the commission of an offense that 5749
is a felony of the third or fourth degree shall then be eligible 5750
for parole, and this person cannot at a later date have the 5751
person's sentence converted to a definite sentence. If the 5752
person refuses to choose between the two possible sentences, the 5753
person shall be sentenced pursuant to the law in effect at the 5754
time of the commission of the offense. 5755
(D) Persons charged with an offense that was a felony of 5756
the first or second degree at the time it was committed, that 5757
was committed on or after January 1, 1974, and that was 5758
committed prior to July 1, 1983, shall be prosecuted for that 5759
offense and, if convicted, shall be sentenced under the law as 5760
it existed at the time the offense was committed. 5761
(E) Persons charged with an offense that is a felony of 5762
the first or second degree that was committed prior to the 5763
effective date March 22, 2019, of this amendment shall be 5764
prosecuted for that offense and, if convicted, shall be 5765
sentenced under the law as it existed at the time the offense 5766

Sec. 2930.19. (A)(1) A victim, victim's representative, or 5768
victim's attorney, if applicable, or the prosecutor, on request 5769
of the victim, has standing as a matter of right to assert, or 5770
to challenge an order denying, the rights of the victim provided 5771
by law in any judicial or administrative proceeding. The trial 5772
court shall act promptly on a request to enforce, or on a 5773
challenge of an order denying, the rights of the victim. In any 5774
case, the trial court shall hear the matter within ten days of 5775
the assertion of the victim's rights. The reasons for any 5776
decision denying relief under this section shall be clearly 5777
stated on the record or in a judgment entry. 5778
(2)(a) If the trial court denies the relief sought under 5779
division (A)(1) of this section, the trial court shall do all of 5780
the following: 5781
(i) Provide the victim, the victim's representative, if 5782
applicable, the victim's attorney, if applicable, and the 5783
parties with notice of the decision and a copy of the judgment 5784
entry; 5785
(ii) Provide the victim, the victim's representative, if 5786
applicable, and the victim's attorney, if applicable, with the 5787
following statement along with the judgment entry: 5788
"NOTICE 5789
The victim, the victim's attorney, if applicable, or the 5790
prosecutor on request of the victim, may appeal this decision or 5791
petition to the court of appeals for an extraordinary writ. If 5792
such an interlocutory appeal or extraordinary writ is sought 5793
while the case is still pending in the trial court, it shall be 5794
initiated no later than fourteen days after notice of the 5795

H. B. No. 72 Page 197

decision was provided to the victim by telephone or electronic 5796
mail to the latest telephone number or electronic mail address 5797
provided by the victim. The prosecutor or the prosecutor's 5798
designee shall provide the notice to the victim and the notice 5799
shall be memorialized in a manner sufficient to prove to the 5800
court the prosecutor or prosecutor's designee sent the notice. 5801
The court shall dismiss any such interlocutory appeal or 5802
petition as untimely if it does not comply with this fourteen- 5803
day limit." 5804
(b)(i) If the court denies the relief sought, the victim 5805
or the victim's attorney, if applicable, or the prosecutor on 5806
request of the victim, may appeal or, if the victim has no 5807
remedy on appeal, petition the court of appeals or supreme court 5808
for an extraordinary writ, and the victim has standing to assert 5809
a right of limited appeal as it pertains to the decisions 5810
impacting the rights of the victim. An interlocutory appeal 5811
filed under this section shall be filed not later than fourteen 5812
days after notice was provided to the victim as described in 5813
division (A)(1) of this section, and such an appeal divests the 5814
trial court of jurisdiction of the portion of the case 5815
implicating the victim's rights until the interlocutory appeal 5816
is resolved by the appellate court. 5817
(ii) Upon the filing of an interlocutory appeal, the trial 5818
court shall transmit those portions of the transcript necessary 5819
for consideration of the issues to be reviewed by the court of 5820
appeals within five business days. Once the transcript is 5821
received by the court of appeals, the party that initiated the 5822
appeal shall have eight days to file a merit brief. Once the 5823
merit brief is filed, the appellee shall have eight days to file 5824
a response brief. The court of appeals shall decide the entire 5825
appeal not later than thirty-five days after the appeal is 5826

filed. Notwithstanding these limits, the litigants, with the 5827
approval of the court, may stipulate to a different period of 5828
time for the briefing and issuance of the decision and judgment 5829
on the appeal. The victim, the victim's attorney, the 5830
prosecutor, or the defendant may notify the supreme court if a 5831
court of appeals has failed to issue a judgment in accordance 5832
with the stipulated period of time. Such notifications are 5833
public records. 5834
(iii) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as 5835
applying to a direct appeal that is filed after the court 5836
sentences the defendant. A victim who wishes to appeal from an 5837
order that is final on its entry after the court sentences the 5838
defendant shall file the notice of appeal within thirty days of 5839
that entry. 5840
(c) If the victim or victim's attorney, if applicable, 5841
petitions for an extraordinary writ, the court of appeals or the 5842
supreme court shall enter an order establishing an expedited 5843
schedule for the filing of an answer, the submission of 5844
evidence, the filing of briefing by the litigants, and the entry 5845
of decision and judgment and shall place the petition on its 5846
accelerated calendar. The court of appeals or the supreme court 5847
shall immediately notify the trial court of the petition, and 5848
the trial court shall transmit to the court of appeals or the 5849
supreme court those portions of the transcript necessary for the 5850
consideration of the issues to be reviewed by the applicable 5851
appellate court within five business days of the filing of the 5852
appeal or petition. The court shall enter judgment within forty- 5853
five days after the petition for an extraordinary writ is filed. 5854
Notwithstanding these limits, the litigants, with the approval 5855
of the court, may stipulate to a different period of time for 5856
the briefing and issuance of the decision and judgment in the 5857

H. B. No. 72 Page 199

action. The victim, the victim's attorney, the prosecutor, or 5858
the defendant may notify the supreme court if a court of appeals 5859
has failed to issue a judgment in accordance with the stipulated 5860
period of time. Such notifications are a public record. 5861
(d) If any interlocutory appeal is pursued to the supreme 5862
court, the supreme court shall enter an order establishing an 5863
expedited schedule for its proceedings, including, as 5864
applicable, the filing of jurisdictional memoranda and ruling 5865
thereon, the transmission of the record, the filing of briefing 5866
by the litigants, oral argument if permitted, and the entry of 5867
decision and judgment and shall place the appeal on its 5868
accelerated calendar. The court shall enter judgment within 5869
sixty days after the appeal is filed. The supreme court shall 5870
immediately notify the trial court of the appeal, and the trial 5871
court shall transmit to the court of appeals or the supreme 5872
court those portions of the transcript necessary for 5873
consideration of the issues to be reviewed by the applicable 5874
appellate court within five business days of the filing of the 5875
appeal. Notwithstanding these limits, the litigants, with the 5876
approval of the court, may stipulate to a different period of 5877
time for the supreme court's proceedings and for the issuance of 5878
the supreme court's decision and judgment in the case. 5879
(e) Nothing in this division applies to a direct appeal 5880
that is filed by the victim after the court sentences the 5881
defendant. A victim who wishes to appeal from an appellate entry 5882
shall file the appropriate notice of appeal to the supreme court 5883
within thirty days of the entry. 5884
(B)(1) A victim of a criminal offense or delinquent act 5885
has the right to be represented by an attorney. Nothing in this 5886
section creates a right to an attorney at public expense for a 5887

H. B. No. 72 Page 200
As Introduced
victim. If a victim is represented by an attorney, the court 5888
shall notify the victim's attorney in the same manner in which 5889
the parties are notified under applicable law or rule. The 5890
victim's attorney shall be included in all bench conferences, 5891
meetings in chambers, and sidebars with the trial court that 5892
directly involve a decision implicating that victim's rights as 5893
enumerated in Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 10a. Nothing 5894
in this section shall be construed as making a victim a party to 5895
the case. 5896
(2) A defendant has a right to respond and be represented 5897
by an attorney for appeals and writs the victim, the victim's 5898
attorney, if applicable, or the prosecutor may file pursuant to 5899
this section. An indigent defendant has the right to appointed 5900
counsel for appeals and writs filed pursuant to this section. 5901
If, as an indigent person, a defendant is unable to employ 5902
counsel, the defendant is entitled to have counsel provided 5903
pursuant to Chapter 120. of the Revised Code. The court shall 5904
notify the defendant and the defendant's attorney in the same 5905
manner that the parties are notified under applicable law or 5906
rule. 5907
(C) The failure of a public official or public agency or 5908
the public official's or public agency's designee to comply with 5909
the requirements of this chapter does not give rise to a claim 5910
for damages against that public official or public agency or 5911
that public official's or public agency's designee, except that 5912
a public agency as an employer may be held responsible for a 5913
violation of section 2930.18 of the Revised Code. 5914
(D) The failure of any person or entity to provide a 5915
right, privilege, or notice to a victim under this chapter does 5916
not constitute grounds for declaring a mistrial or new trial, 5917

H. B. No. 72 Page 201
As Introduced
for setting aside a conviction, sentence, adjudication, or 5918
disposition, or for granting postconviction release to a 5919
defendant or alleged juvenile offender. 5920
(E) If there is a conflict between a provision in this 5921
chapter and a specific statute governing the procedure in a case 5922
involving a capital offense, the specific statute supersedes the 5923
provision in this chapter. 5924
(F) A defendant or juvenile offender may not raise the 5925
failure to afford a right to a victim as error in any legal 5926
argument to provide an advantage to that defendant or juvenile 5927
offender in any motion, including a dispositive motion, motion 5928
for a mistrial, motion for new trial, or motion to have a 5929
conviction, sentence, or disposition set aside, in any petition 5930
for post-conviction relief, or in any assignment of error on 5931
appeal. 5932
(G)(F) If the victim of a criminal offense or delinquent 5933
act is incarcerated in a state or local correctional facility or 5934
is in the legal custody of the department of youth services, the 5935
victim's rights under this chapter may be modified by court 5936
order to prevent any security risk, hardship, or undue burden 5937
upon a public official or public agency with a duty under this 5938
chapter. 5939
(H)(G) As used in this section, "post-conviction release" 5940
means judicial release, early release, and parole, but does not 5941
mean relief pursuant to a federal petition in habeas corpus. 5942
Sec. 2937.222. (A) On the motion of the prosecuting 5943
attorney or on the judge's own motion, the judge shall hold a 5944
hearing to determine whether an accused person charged with 5945
aggravated murder when it is not a capital offense, murder, a 5946

H. B. No. 72 Page 202
As Introduced
felony of the first or second degree, a violation of section 5947
2903.06 of the Revised Code, a violation of section 2903.211 of 5948
the Revised Code that is a felony, or a felony OVI offense shall 5949
be denied bail. The judge shall order that the accused be 5950
detained until the conclusion of the hearing. Except for good 5951
cause, a continuance on the motion of the state shall not exceed 5952
three court days. Except for good cause, a continuance on the 5953
motion of the accused shall not exceed five court days unless 5954
the motion of the accused waives in writing the five-day limit 5955
and states in writing a specific period for which the accused 5956
requests a continuance. A continuance granted upon a motion of 5957
the accused that waives in writing the five-day limit shall not 5958
exceed five court days after the period of continuance requested 5959
in the motion. 5960
At the hearing, the accused has the right to be 5961
represented by counsel and, if the accused is indigent, to have 5962
counsel appointed. The judge shall afford the accused an 5963
opportunity to testify, to present witnesses and other 5964
information, and to cross-examine witnesses who appear at the 5965
hearing. The rules concerning admissibility of evidence in 5966
criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and 5967
consideration of information at the hearing. Regardless of 5968
whether the hearing is being held on the motion of the 5969
prosecuting attorney or on the court's own motion, the state has 5970
the burden of proving that the proof is evident or the 5971
presumption great that the accused committed the offense with 5972
which the accused is charged, of proving that the accused poses 5973
a substantial risk of serious physical harm to any person or to 5974
the community, and of proving that no release conditions will 5975
reasonably assure the safety of that person and the community. 5976
The judge may reopen the hearing at any time before trial 5977

H. B. No. 72 Page 203
As Introduced
if the judge finds that information exists that was not known to 5978
the movant at the time of the hearing and that that information 5979
has a material bearing on whether bail should be denied. If a 5980
municipal court or county court enters an order denying bail, a 5981
judge of the court of common pleas having jurisdiction over the 5982
case may continue that order or may hold a hearing pursuant to 5983
this section to determine whether to continue that order. 5984
(B) No accused person shall be denied bail pursuant to 5985
this section unless the judge finds by clear and convincing 5986
evidence that the proof is evident or the presumption great that 5987
the accused committed the offense described in division (A) of 5988
this section with which the accused is charged, finds by clear 5989
and convincing evidence that the accused poses a substantial 5990
risk of serious physical harm to any person or to the community, 5991
and finds by clear and convincing evidence that no release 5992
conditions will reasonably assure the safety of that person and 5993
the community. 5994
(C) The judge, in determining whether the accused person 5995
described in division (A) of this section poses a substantial 5996
risk of serious physical harm to any person or to the community 5997
and whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably 5998
assure the safety of that person and the community, shall 5999
consider all available information regarding all of the 6000
following: 6001
(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense charged, 6002
including whether the offense is an offense of violence or 6003
involves alcohol or a drug of abuse; 6004
(2) The weight of the evidence against the accused; 6005
(3) The history and characteristics of the accused, 6006

H. B. No. 72 Page 204

including, but not limited to, both of the following: 6007
(a) The character, physical and mental condition, family 6008
ties, employment, financial resources, length of residence in 6009
the community, community ties, past conduct, history relating to 6010
drug or alcohol abuse, and criminal history of the accused; 6011
(b) Whether, at the time of the current alleged offense or 6012
at the time of the arrest of the accused, the accused was on 6013
probation, parole, post-release control, or other release 6014
pending trial, sentencing, appeal, or completion of sentence for 6015
the commission of an offense under the laws of this state, 6016
another state, or the United States or under a municipal 6017
ordinance. 6018
(4) The nature and seriousness of the danger to any person 6019
or the community that would be posed by the person's release. 6020
(D)(1) An order of the court of common pleas denying bail 6021
pursuant to this section is a final appealable order. In an 6022
appeal pursuant to division (D) of this section, the court of 6023
appeals shall do all of the following: 6024
(a) Give the appeal priority on its calendar; 6025
(b) Liberally modify or dispense with formal requirements 6026
in the interest of a speedy and just resolution of the appeal; 6027
(c) Decide the appeal expeditiously; 6028
(d) Promptly enter its judgment affirming or reversing the 6029
order denying bail. 6030
(2) The pendency of an appeal under this section does not 6031
deprive the court of common pleas of jurisdiction to conduct 6032
further proceedings in the case or to further consider the order 6033
denying bail in accordance with this section. If, during the 6034

H. B. No. 72 Page 205
As Introduced
pendency of an appeal under division (D) of this section, the 6035
court of common pleas sets aside or terminates the order denying 6036
bail, the court of appeals shall dismiss the appeal. 6037
(E) As used in this section: 6038
(1) "Court day" has the same meaning as in section 5122.01 6039
of the Revised Code. 6040
(2) "Felony OVI offense" means a third degree felony OVI 6041

Code. 6249
(E) The county auditor shall draw a warrant on the county 6250
treasurer for the payment of such counsel in the amount fixed by 6251

to the auditor. The county auditor shall report periodically, 6253

and to the Ohio public defender commission the amounts paid out 6255
pursuant to the approval of the court under this section, 6256

to the state public defender for reimbursement. The request for 6260
reimbursement shall be accompanied by a financial disclosure 6261
form completed by each indigent person for whom counsel was 6262

Revised Code, the commission shall notify the board of county 6281
commissioners of the county that the county system for paying 6282
appointed counsel has failed to comply with its rules. Unless 6283
the board corrects the conduct of its appointed counsel system 6284
to comply with the rules within ninety days after the date of 6285
the notice, the state public defender may deny all or part of 6286
the county's reimbursement from the state provided for in this 6287
section. 6288

the defendant's right to trial by jury and elects to be tried by 6290
the court under section 2945.05 of the Revised Code, any judge 6291
of the court in which the cause is pending shall proceed to 6292
hear, try, and determine the cause in accordance with the rules 6293
and in like manner as if the cause were being tried before a 6294
jury. If the accused is charged with an offense punishable with 6295
death, he shall be tried by a court to be composed of three 6296
judges, consisting of the judge presiding at the time in the 6297
trial of criminal cases and two other judges to be designated by 6298
the presiding judge or chief justice of that court, and in case 6299
there is neither a presiding judge nor a chief justice, by the 6300
chief justice of the supreme court. The judges or a majority of 6301
them may decide all questions of fact and law arising upon the 6302
trial; however the accused shall not be found guilty or not 6303
guilty of any offense unless the judges unanimously find the 6304
accused guilty or not guilty. If the accused pleads guilty of 6305

H. B. No. 72 Page 214
As Introduced
aggravated murder, a court composed of three judges shall 6306
examine the witnesses, determine whether the accused is guilty 6307
of aggravated murder or any other offense, and pronounce 6308
sentence accordingly. The court shall follow the procedures 6309
contained in sections 2929.03 and 2929.04 of the Revised Code in 6310
all cases in which the accused is charged with an offense 6311
punishable by death. If in the composition of the court it is 6312
necessary that a judge from another county be assigned by the 6313
chief justice, the judge from another county shall be 6314
compensated for his services as provided by section 141.07 of 6315
the Revised Code. 6316
Sec. 2945.10. The trial of an issue upon an indictment or 6317
information shall proceed before the trial court or jury as 6318
follows: 6319

the prosecution, and may briefly state the evidence by which the 6321
counsel for the state expects to sustain it. 6322

state the defense, and may briefly state the evidence which the 6324
defendant or the defendant's counsel expects to offer in support 6325
of it. 6326
(C) The state must first produce its evidence and the 6327
defendant shall then produce the defendant's evidence. 6328
(D) The state will then be confined to rebutting evidence, 6329
but the court, for good reason, in furtherance of justice, may 6330
permit evidence to be offered by either side out of its order. 6331
(E) When the evidence is concluded, one of the following 6332

to the jury before orally instructing the jury, and shall permit 6337
the jury to retain and consult the instructions during the 6338
court's presentation of the oral instructions and during the 6339
jury's deliberations. 6340
(2) In a case that is not a capital case, either party may 6341
request instructions to the jury on the points of law, which 6342
instructions shall be reduced to writing if either party 6343
requests it. 6344
(F) When the evidence is concluded, unless the case is 6345
submitted without argument, the counsel for the state shall 6346
commence, the defendant or the defendant's counsel follow, and 6347
the counsel for the state conclude the argument to the jury. 6348
(G) The court, after the argument is concluded and before 6349
proceeding with other business, shall forthwith charge the jury. 6350
Such charge shall be reduced to writing by the court if either 6351
party requests it before the argument to the jury is commenced. 6352
Such charge, or other charge or instruction provided for in this 6353
section, when so written and given, shall not be orally 6354
qualified, modified, or explained to the jury by the court. 6355
Written charges and instructions shall be taken by the jury in 6356
their retirement and returned with their verdict into court and 6357
remain on file with the papers of the case. 6358
The court may deviate from the order of proceedings listed 6359

the jurors in misdemeanor cases and, four of the jurors in 6370
felony cases other than capital cases that may subject the 6371
defendant to a sentence of life imprisonment, and six of the 6372
jurors in cases that may subject the defendant to a sentence of 6373
life imprisonment. If there is more than one defendant, each 6374
defendant may peremptorily challenge the same number of jurors 6375
as if he the defendant were the sole defendant. 6376
(2) Notwithstanding Criminal Rule 24, in capital cases in 6377
which there is only one defendant, each party, in addition to 6378
the challenges for cause authorized by law, may peremptorily 6379
challenge twelve of the jurors. If there is more than one 6380
defendant, each defendant may peremptorily challenge the same 6381
number of jurors as if he were the sole defendant. 6382
(3) In any case in which there are multiple defendants, 6383
the prosecuting attorney may peremptorily challenge a number of 6384
jurors equal to the total number of peremptory challenges 6385
allowed to all of the defendants. 6386
(B) If any indictments, informations, or complaints are 6387
consolidated for trial, the consolidated cases shall be 6388
considered, for purposes of exercising peremptory challenges, as 6389
though the defendants or offenses had been joined in the same 6390
indictment, information, or complaint. 6391
(C) The exercise of peremptory challenges authorized by 6392

found the indictment in the case; 6398
(B) That the person is possessed of a state of mind 6399
evincing enmity or bias toward the defendant or the state; but 6400
no person summoned as a juror shall be disqualified by reason of 6401
a previously formed or expressed opinion with reference to the 6402
guilt or innocence of the accused, if the court is satisfied, 6403
from examination of the juror or from other evidence, that the 6404

unequivocally states that under no circumstances will the person 6408
follow the instructions of a trial judge and consider fairly the 6409
imposition of a sentence of death in a particular case. A 6410
prospective juror's conscientious or religious opposition to the 6411
death penalty in and of itself is not grounds for a challenge 6412
for cause. All parties shall be given wide latitude in voir dire 6413
questioning in this regard. 6414
(D) That the person is related by consanguinity or 6415
affinity within the fifth degree to the person alleged to be 6416

(H) (G) That the person has chronic alcoholism, or a drug 6428
dependency; 6429
(I) (H) That the person has been convicted of a crime that 6430
by law disqualifies the person from serving on a jury; 6431
(J) (I) That the person has an action pending between the 6432

following: 6539

H. B. No. 72 Page 222
As Introduced
(I) Dismiss the charges pending against the defendant. A 6540
dismissal under this division is not a bar to further 6541
prosecution based on the same conduct. Upon dismissal of the 6542
charges, the trial court shall discharge the defendant unless 6543
the court or prosecutor, after consideration of the requirements 6544
of section 5122.11 of the Revised Code, files an affidavit in 6545
probate court alleging that the defendant is a mentally ill 6546
person subject to court order or a person with an intellectual 6547
disability subject to institutionalization by court order. If an 6548
affidavit is filed in probate court, the trial court may detain 6549
the defendant for ten days pending a hearing in the probate 6550
court and shall send to the probate court copies of all written 6551
reports of the defendant's mental condition that were prepared 6552
pursuant to section 2945.371 of the Revised Code. The trial 6553
court or prosecutor shall specify in the appropriate space on 6554
the affidavit that the defendant is a person described in this 6555
subdivision. 6556
(II) Order the defendant to undergo outpatient competency 6557
restoration treatment at a facility operated or certified by the 6558
department of mental health and addiction services as being 6559
qualified to treat mental illness, at a public or community 6560
mental health facility, at a jail that employs or contracts with 6561
an individual or entity listed in division (B)(1)(b)(i) of this 6562
section to provide treatment or continuing evaluation and 6563
treatment at a jail, or in the care of a psychiatrist or other 6564
mental health professional. If a defendant who has been released 6565
on bail or recognizance refuses to comply with court-ordered 6566
outpatient treatment under this division, the court may dismiss 6567
the charges pending against the defendant and proceed under 6568
division (B)(1)(a)(v)(I) of this section or may amend the 6569
conditions of bail or recognizance and order the sheriff to take 6570

(vi) If the defendant has not been charged with a felony 6574
offense but has been charged with a misdemeanor offense of 6575
violence and after taking into consideration all relevant 6576
reports, information, and other evidence, the court finds that 6577
the defendant is incompetent to stand trial, the prosecutor in 6578
the case may recommend that the court follow the procedures 6579
prescribed in division (B)(1)(a)(v) of this section. If the 6580
prosecutor does not make such a recommendation, the court shall 6581
follow the procedures in division (B)(1)(a)(i) of this section. 6582
(b)(i) The court order for the defendant to undergo 6583
treatment or continuing evaluation and treatment under division 6584
(B)(1)(a) of this section shall specify that the defendant, if 6585
determined to require mental health treatment or continuing 6586
evaluation and treatment, shall be committed to one of the 6587
following: 6588

for treatment or continuing evaluation and treatment at a 6590
hospital, facility, or agency, as determined to be clinically 6591
appropriate by the department; 6592

health and addiction services as being qualified to treat mental 6594
illness; 6595
(III) A public or community mental health facility; 6596

jail; 6600
(V) A psychiatrist or another mental health professional 6601
for treatment or continuing evaluation and treatment. 6602
(ii) Prior to placing the defendant, the department of 6603
mental health and addiction services shall obtain court approval 6604
for that placement following a hearing. The court order for the 6605
defendant to undergo treatment or continuing evaluation and 6606
treatment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall specify 6607
that the defendant, if determined to require treatment or 6608
continuing evaluation and treatment for an intellectual 6609
disability, shall receive treatment or continuing evaluation and 6610
treatment at an institution or facility operated by the 6611
department of developmental disabilities, at a facility 6612
certified by the department of developmental disabilities as 6613
being qualified to treat intellectual disabilities, at a public 6614
or private intellectual disabilities facility, or by a 6615
psychiatrist or another intellectual disabilities professional. 6616
In any case, the order may restrict the defendant's freedom of 6617
movement as the court considers necessary. The prosecutor in the 6618
defendant's case shall send to the chief clinical officer of the 6619
hospital, facility, or agency where the defendant is placed by 6620
the department of mental health and addiction services, or to 6621
the managing officer or director of the institution, facility, 6622
or jail, or the person to which the defendant is committed, 6623
copies of relevant police reports and other background 6624
information that pertains to the defendant and is available to 6625
the prosecutor unless the prosecutor determines that the release 6626
of any of the information in the police reports or any of the 6627
other background information to unauthorized persons would 6628
interfere with the effective prosecution of any person or would 6629
create a substantial risk of harm to any person. 6630

H. B. No. 72 Page 225
As Introduced
(iii) In determining the place of commitment, the court 6631
shall consider the extent to which the person is a danger to the 6632
person and to others, the need for security, the availability of 6633
housing and supportive services, including outpatient mental 6634
health services in the community, and the type of crime involved 6635
and shall order the least restrictive alternative available that 6636
is consistent with public safety and treatment goals. In 6637
weighing these factors, the court shall give preference to 6638
protecting public safety and the availability of housing and 6639
supportive services. 6640
(c) If the defendant is found incompetent to stand trial, 6641
if the chief clinical officer of the hospital, facility, or 6642
agency where the defendant is placed, or the managing officer or 6643
director of the institution, facility, or jail, or the person to 6644
which the defendant is committed for treatment or continuing 6645
evaluation and treatment under division (B)(1)(b) of this 6646
section determines that medication is necessary to restore the 6647
defendant's competency to stand trial, and if the defendant 6648
lacks the capacity to give informed consent or refuses 6649
medication, the chief clinical officer of the hospital, 6650
facility, or agency where the defendant is placed, or the 6651
managing officer or director of the institution, facility, or 6652
jail, or the person to which the defendant is committed for 6653
treatment or continuing evaluation and treatment may petition 6654
the court for authorization for the involuntary administration 6655
of medication. The court shall hold a hearing on the petition 6656
within five days of the filing of the petition if the petition 6657
was filed in a municipal court or a county court regarding an 6658
incompetent defendant charged with a misdemeanor or within ten 6659
days of the filing of the petition if the petition was filed in 6660
a court of common pleas regarding an incompetent defendant 6661

H. B. No. 72 Page 226

charged with a felony offense. Following the hearing, the court 6662
may authorize the involuntary administration of medication or 6663
may dismiss the petition. 6664
(2) If the court finds that the defendant is incompetent 6665
to stand trial and that, even if the defendant is provided with 6666
a course of treatment, there is not a substantial probability 6667
that the defendant will become competent to stand trial within 6668
one year, the court shall order the discharge of the defendant, 6669
unless upon motion of the prosecutor or on its own motion, the 6670
court either seeks to retain jurisdiction over the defendant 6671
pursuant to section 2945.39 of the Revised Code or files an 6672
affidavit in the probate court for the civil commitment of the 6673
defendant pursuant to Chapter 5122. or 5123. of the Revised Code 6674
alleging that the defendant is a person with a mental illness 6675
subject to court order or a person with an intellectual 6676
disability subject to institutionalization by court order. If an 6677
affidavit is filed in the probate court, the trial court shall 6678
send to the probate court copies of all written reports of the 6679
defendant's mental condition that were prepared pursuant to 6680
section 2945.371 of the Revised Code. 6681
The trial court may issue the temporary order of detention 6682
that a probate court may issue under section 5122.11 or 5123.71 6683
of the Revised Code, to remain in effect until the probable 6684
cause or initial hearing in the probate court. Further 6685
proceedings in the probate court are civil proceedings governed 6686
by Chapter 5122. or 5123. of the Revised Code. 6687

subject to division (A)(2)(b) of section 2953.09 of the Revised 6904
Code, execution of the sentence or judgment imposed for any 6905
fixed time that will give the person time either to prepare and 6906

or after January 1, 1995, the judgment or final order may be 6968
appealed from the trial court directly to the supreme court as a 6969
matter of right. The supreme court in criminal cases shall not 6970
be required to determine as to the weight of the evidence, 6971
except that, in cases in which a sentence of death is imposed 6972
for an offense committed on or after January 1, 1995, and in 6973
which the question of the weight of the evidence to support the 6974
judgment has been raised on appeal, the supreme court shall 6975

an appeal from a mayor's court, the appellate court may affirm 6981
the judgment or reverse it, in whole or in part, or modify it, 6982
and order the accused to be discharged or grant a new trial. The 6983
appellate court may remand the accused for the sole purpose of 6984

a case in which a sentence of death is imposed for an offense 7002
committed before January 1, 1995, both the court of appeals and 7003
the supreme court, and for a case in which a sentence of death 7004

Sec. 2953.08. (A) In addition to any other right to appeal 7007
and except as provided in division (D) of this section, a 7008
defendant who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a felony may 7009
appeal as a matter of right the sentence imposed upon the 7010
defendant on one of the following grounds: 7011
(1) The sentence consisted of or included the maximum 7012
definite prison term allowed for the offense by division (A) of 7013
section 2929.14 or section 2929.142 of the Revised Code or, with 7014
respect to a non-life felony indefinite prison term, the longest 7015
minimum prison term allowed for the offense by division (A)(1) 7016
(a) or (2)(a) of section 2929.14 of the Revised Code, the 7017
maximum definite prison term or longest minimum prison term was 7018
not required for the offense pursuant to Chapter 2925. or any 7019
other provision of the Revised Code, and the court imposed the 7020
sentence under one of the following circumstances: 7021
(a) The sentence was imposed for only one offense. 7022

H. B. No. 72 Page 238
As Introduced
(b) The sentence was imposed for two or more offenses 7023
arising out of a single incident, and the court imposed the 7024
maximum definite prison term or longest minimum prison term for 7025
the offense of the highest degree. 7026
(2) The sentence consisted of or included a prison term 7027
and the offense for which it was imposed is a felony of the 7028
fourth or fifth degree or is a felony drug offense that is a 7029
violation of a provision of Chapter 2925. of the Revised Code 7030
and that is specified as being subject to division (B) of 7031
section 2929.13 of the Revised Code for purposes of sentencing. 7032
If the court specifies that it found one or more of the factors 7033
in division (B)(1)(b) of section 2929.13 of the Revised Code to 7034
apply relative to the defendant, the defendant is not entitled 7035
under this division to appeal as a matter of right the sentence 7036
imposed upon the offender. 7037
(3) The person was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a 7038
violent sex offense or a designated homicide, assault, or 7039
kidnapping offense, was adjudicated a sexually violent predator 7040
in relation to that offense, and was sentenced pursuant to 7041
division (A)(3) of section 2971.03 of the Revised Code, if the 7042
minimum term of the indefinite term imposed pursuant to division 7043
(A)(3) of section 2971.03 of the Revised Code is the longest 7044
term available for the offense from among the range of definite 7045
terms listed in section 2929.14 of the Revised Code or, with 7046
respect to a non-life felony indefinite prison term, the longest 7047
minimum prison term allowed for the offense by division (A)(1) 7048
(a) or (2)(a) of section 2929.14 of the Revised Code. As used in 7049
this division, "designated homicide, assault, or kidnapping 7050
offense" and "violent sex offense" have the same meanings as in 7051
section 2971.01 of the Revised Code. As used in this division, 7052
"adjudicated a sexually violent predator" has the same meaning 7053

H. B. No. 72 Page 239

as in section 2929.01 of the Revised Code, and a person is 7054
"adjudicated a sexually violent predator" in the same manner and 7055
the same circumstances as are described in that section. 7056
(4) The sentence is contrary to law. 7057

general, if one of those persons prosecuted the case, may appeal 7065
as a matter of right a sentence imposed upon a defendant who is 7066
convicted of or pleads guilty to a felony or, in the 7067
circumstances described in division (B)(3) of this section the 7068
modification of a sentence imposed upon such a defendant, on any 7069
of the following grounds: 7070
(1) The sentence did not include a prison term despite a 7071
presumption favoring a prison term for the offense for which it 7072
was imposed, as set forth in section 2929.13 or Chapter 2925. of 7073
the Revised Code. 7074
(2) The sentence is contrary to law. 7075
(3) The sentence is a modification under section 2929.20 7076
of the Revised Code of a sentence that was imposed for a felony 7077
of the first or second degree. 7078
(C)(1) In addition to the right to appeal a sentence 7079
granted under division (A) or (B) of this section, a defendant 7080
who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a felony may seek leave 7081
to appeal a sentence imposed upon the defendant on the basis 7082

H. B. No. 72 Page 240
As Introduced
that the sentencing judge has imposed consecutive sentences 7083
under division (C)(3) of section 2929.14 of the Revised Code and 7084
that the consecutive sentences exceed the maximum definite 7085
prison term allowed by division (A) of that section for the most 7086
serious offense of which the defendant was convicted or, with 7087
respect to a non-life felony indefinite prison term, exceed the 7088
longest minimum prison term allowed by division (A)(1)(a) or (2) 7089
(a) of that section for the most serious such offense. Upon the 7090
filing of a motion under this division, the court of appeals may 7091
grant leave to appeal the sentence if the court determines that 7092
the allegation included as the basis of the motion is true. 7093
(2) A defendant may seek leave to appeal an additional 7094
sentence imposed upon the defendant pursuant to division (B)(2) 7095
(a) or (b) of section 2929.14 of the Revised Code if the 7096
additional sentence is for a definite prison term that is longer 7097
than five years. 7098
(D)(1) A sentence imposed upon a defendant is not subject 7099
to review under this section if the sentence is authorized by 7100
law, has been recommended jointly by the defendant and the 7101
prosecution in the case, and is imposed by a sentencing judge. 7102
(2) Except as provided in division (C)(2) of this section, 7103
a sentence imposed upon a defendant is not subject to review 7104
under this section if the sentence is imposed pursuant to 7105
division (B)(2)(b) of section 2929.14 of the Revised Code. 7106
Except as otherwise provided in this division, a defendant 7107
retains all rights to appeal as provided under this chapter or 7108
any other provision of the Revised Code. A defendant has the 7109
right to appeal under this chapter or any other provision of the 7110
Revised Code the court's application of division (B)(2)(c) of 7111
section 2929.14 of the Revised Code. 7112

file an appeal of a sentence under this section to a court of 7118
appeals within the time limits specified in Rule 4(B) of the 7119
Rules of Appellate Procedure, provided that if the appeal is 7120
pursuant to division (B)(3) of this section, the time limits 7121
specified in that rule shall not commence running until the 7122
court grants the motion that makes the sentence modification in 7123
question. A sentence appeal under this section shall be 7124
consolidated with any other appeal in the case. If no other 7125
appeal is filed, the court of appeals may review only the 7126
portions of the trial record that pertain to sentencing. 7127
(F) On the appeal of a sentence under this section, the 7128
record to be reviewed shall include all of the following, as 7129
applicable: 7130
(1) Any presentence, psychiatric, or other investigative 7131
report that was submitted to the court in writing before the 7132
sentence was imposed. An appellate court that reviews a 7133
presentence investigation report prepared pursuant to section 7134
2947.06 or 2951.03 of the Revised Code or Criminal Rule 32.2 in 7135
connection with the appeal of a sentence under this section 7136
shall comply with division (D)(3) of section 2951.03 of the 7137
Revised Code when the appellate court is not using the 7138
presentence investigation report, and the appellate court's use 7139
of a presentence investigation report of that nature in 7140
connection with the appeal of a sentence under this section does 7141
not affect the otherwise confidential character of the contents 7142

H. B. No. 72 Page 242

of that report as described in division (D)(1) of section 7143
2951.03 of the Revised Code and does not cause that report to 7144
become a public record, as defined in section 149.43 of the 7145
Revised Code, following the appellate court's use of the report. 7146
(2) The trial record in the case in which the sentence was 7147
imposed; 7148
(3) Any oral or written statements made to or by the court 7149
at the sentencing hearing at which the sentence was imposed; 7150
(4) Any written findings that the court was required to 7151
make in connection with the modification of the sentence 7152
pursuant to a judicial release under division (I) of section 7153
2929.20 of the Revised Code. 7154
(G)(1) If the sentencing court was required to make the 7155
findings required by division (B) or (D) of section 2929.13 or 7156
division (I) of section 2929.20 of the Revised Code, or to state 7157
the findings of the trier of fact required by division (B)(2)(e) 7158
of section 2929.14 of the Revised Code, relative to the 7159
imposition or modification of the sentence, and if the 7160
sentencing court failed to state the required findings on the 7161
record, the court hearing an appeal under division (A), (B), or 7162
(C) of this section shall remand the case to the sentencing 7163
court and instruct the sentencing court to state, on the record, 7164
the required findings. 7165
(2) The court hearing an appeal under division (A), (B), 7166

vacate the sentence and remand the matter to the sentencing 7172
court for resentencing. The appellate court's standard for 7173
review is not whether the sentencing court abused its 7174
discretion. The appellate court may take any action authorized 7175
by this division if it clearly and convincingly finds either of 7176
the following: 7177
(a) That the record does not support the sentencing 7178
court's findings under division (B) or (D) of section 2929.13, 7179
division (B)(2)(e) or (C)(4) of section 2929.14, or division (I) 7180
of section 2929.20 of the Revised Code, whichever, if any, is 7181
relevant; 7182
(b) That the sentence is otherwise contrary to law. 7183
(H) A judgment or final order of a court of appeals under 7184
this section may be appealed, by leave of court, to the supreme 7185
court. 7186
(I) As used in this section, "non-life felony indefinite 7187
prison term" has the same meaning as in section 2929.01 of the 7188
Revised Code. 7189
Sec. 2953.09. (A)(1) Upon filing an appeal in the supreme 7190
court, the execution of the sentence or judgment imposed in 7191
cases of felony is suspended. 7192
(2)(a)(2) If a notice of appeal is filed pursuant to the 7193
Rules of Appellate Procedure by a defendant who is convicted in 7194
a municipal or county court or a court of common pleas of a 7195
felony or misdemeanor under the Revised Code or an ordinance of 7196
a municipal corporation, the filing of the notice of appeal does 7197
not suspend execution of the sentence or judgment imposed. 7198
However, consistent with divisions (A)(2)(b), (B), and (C) of 7199
this section, section 2937.011 of the Revised Code, and 7200

amount and nature of any bail that is required. The bail shall 7205
at least be conditioned that the defendant will prosecute the 7206
appeal without delay and abide by the judgment and sentence of 7207
the court. 7208
(b)(i) A court of common pleas or court of appeals may 7209
suspend the execution of a sentence of death imposed for an 7210
offense committed before January 1, 1995, only if no date for 7211
execution has been set by the supreme court, good cause is shown 7212
for the suspension, the defendant files a motion requesting the 7213
suspension, and notice has been given to the prosecuting 7214
attorney of the appropriate county. 7215
(ii) A court of common pleas may suspend the execution of 7216
a sentence of death imposed for an offense committed on or after 7217
January 1, 1995, only if no date for execution has been set by 7218
the supreme court, good cause is shown, the defendant files a 7219
motion requesting the suspension, and notice has been given to 7220
the prosecuting attorney of the appropriate county. 7221
(iii) A court of common pleas or court of appeals may 7222
suspend the execution of the sentence or judgment imposed for a 7223
felony in a capital case in which a sentence of death is not 7224
imposed only if no date for execution of the sentence has been 7225
set by the supreme court, good cause is shown for the 7226
suspension, the defendant files a motion requesting the 7227
suspension, and only after notice has been given to the 7228

2903.02, 2903.03, 2903.04, 2903.11, 2905.01, 2905.02, 2905.11, 7236
2907.02, 2909.02, 2911.01, 2911.02, or 2911.11 of the Revised 7237
Code or is felonious sexual penetration in violation of former 7238
section 2907.12 of the Revised Code. 7239
(C) If a trial judge of a court of common pleas is 7240
prohibited by division (B) of this section from releasing on 7241
bail pursuant to division (A)(2)(a)(A)(2) of this section a 7242
defendant who is convicted of a bailable offense and not 7243
sentenced to imprisonment for life, the appropriate court of 7244
appeals or two judges of it, upon motion of the defendant and 7245
for good cause shown, may release the defendant on bail in 7246
accordance with division (A)(2) of this section. 7247
Sec. 2953.10. When an appeal is taken from a court of 7248
appeals to the supreme court, the supreme court has the same 7249
power and authority to suspend the execution of sentence during 7250
the pendency of the appeal and admit the defendant to bail as 7251
does the court of appeals unless another section of the Revised 7252
Code or the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court specify a 7253
distinct bail or suspension of sentence authority. 7254
When an appeal in a case in which a sentence of death is 7255
imposed for an offense committed on or after January 1, 1995, is 7256
taken directly from the trial court to the supreme court, the 7257
supreme court has the same power and authority to suspend the 7258
execution of the sentence during the pendency of the appeal and 7259
admit the defendant to bail as does the court of appeals for 7260

cases in which a sentence of death is imposed for an offense 7261
committed before January 1, 1995, unless another section of the 7262

Sec. 2953.21. (A)(1)(a) A person in any either of the 7265
following categories may file a petition in the court that 7266
imposed sentence, stating the grounds for relief relied upon, 7267
and asking the court to vacate or set aside the judgment or 7268

been analyzed in the context of and upon consideration of all 7309
available admissible evidence related to the person's case as 7310
described in division (D) of section 2953.74 of the Revised 7311

petition for postconviction relief under division (A) of this 7326
section by a person who has been sentenced to death, or with the 7327
litigation of a petition so filed, the court, for good cause 7328
shown, may authorize the petitioner in seeking the 7329
postconviction relief and the prosecuting attorney of the county 7330
served by the court in defending the proceeding, to take 7331
depositions and to issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum in 7332
accordance with divisions (A)(1)(e), (A)(1)(f), and (C) of this 7333
section, and to any other form of discovery as in a civil action 7334
that the court in its discretion permits. The court may limit 7335

discovery that is relevant to the claim and was available under 7337
Criminal Rule 16 through conclusion of the original criminal 7338

petitioner or prosecuting attorney to take depositions and issue 7340
subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum in either of the following 7341
circumstances: 7342
(i) For any witness who testified at trial or who was 7343
disclosed by the state prior to trial, except as otherwise 7344
provided in this division, the petitioner or prosecuting 7345
attorney shows clear and convincing evidence that the witness is 7346
material and that a deposition of the witness or the issuing of 7347
a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum is of assistance in order to 7348
substantiate or refute the petitioner's claim that there is a 7349

reasonable probability of an altered verdict. This division does 7350
not apply if the witness was unavailable for trial or would not 7351
voluntarily be interviewed by the defendant or prosecuting 7352
attorney. 7353
(ii) For any witness with respect to whom division (A)(1) 7354
(e)(i) of this section does not apply, the petitioner or 7355
prosecuting attorney shows good cause that the witness is 7356
material and that a deposition of the witness or the issuing of 7357
a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum is of assistance in order to 7358
substantiate or refute the petitioner's claim that there is a 7359
reasonable probability of an altered verdict. 7360
(f) If a person who has been sentenced to death and who 7361
files a petition for postconviction relief under division (A) of 7362
this section requests postconviction discovery as described in 7363
division (A)(1)(e) of this section or if the prosecuting 7364
attorney of the county served by the court requests 7365
postconviction discovery as described in that division, within 7366
ten days after the docketing of the request, or within any other 7367
time that the court sets for good cause shown, the prosecuting 7368

request or the petitioner shall respond by answer or motion to 7370
the prosecuting attorney's request, whichever is applicable. 7371

justice requires to protect a party or person from oppression or 7381
undue burden or expense, including but not limited to the orders 7382
described in divisions (A)(1)(h)(i) to (viii) of this section. 7383
The court also may make any such order if, in its discretion, it 7384
determines that the discovery sought would be irrelevant to the 7385
claims made in the petition; and if the court makes any such 7386
order on that basis, it shall explain in the order the reasons 7387
why the discovery would be irrelevant. 7388
(h) If a petitioner, prosecuting attorney, or person from 7389
whom discovery is sought makes a motion for an order under 7390
division (A)(1)(g) of this section and the order is denied in 7391
whole or in part, the court, on terms and conditions as are 7392
just, may order that any party or person provide or permit 7393
discovery as described in division (A)(1)(e) of this section. 7394
The provisions of Civil Rule 37(A)(4) apply to the award of 7395
expenses incurred in relation to the motion, except that in no 7396
case shall a court require a petitioner who is indigent to pay 7397
expenses under those provisions. 7398
Before any person moves for an order under division (A)(1) 7399
(g) of this section, that person shall make a reasonable effort 7400
to resolve the matter through discussion with the petitioner or 7401
prosecuting attorney seeking discovery. A motion for an order 7402
under division (A)(1)(g) of this section shall be accompanied by 7403
a statement reciting the effort made to resolve the matter in 7404
accordance with this paragraph. 7405

development, or commercial information not be disclosed or be 7422
disclosed only in a designated way; 7423
(viii) That the parties simultaneously file specified 7424
documents or information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be 7425
opened as directed by the court. 7426
(i) Any postconviction discovery authorized under division 7427
(A)(1)(e) of this section shall be completed not later than 7428
eighteen months after the start of the discovery proceedings 7429
unless, for good cause shown, the court extends that period for 7430
completing the discovery. 7431
(j) Nothing in division (A)(1)(e) of this section 7432
authorizes, or shall be construed as authorizing, the 7433
relitigation, or discovery in support of relitigation, of any 7434
matter barred by the doctrine of res judicata. 7435

person who has been convicted of a criminal offense and 7437

sentenced to death and who has unsuccessfully raised the same 7438
claims in a petition for postconviction relief. 7439
(2)(a)(2) Except as otherwise provided in section 2953.23 7440
of the Revised Code, a petition under division (A)(1)(a)(i), 7441
(ii), or (iii) (A)(1)(a) of this section shall be filed no later 7442
than three hundred sixty-five days after the date on which the 7443
trial transcript is filed in the court of appeals in the direct 7444
appeal of the judgment of conviction or adjudication or, if the 7445
direct appeal involves a sentence of death, the date on which 7446
the trial transcript is filed in the supreme court. If no appeal 7447
is taken, except as otherwise provided in section 2953.23 of the 7448
Revised Code, the petition shall be filed no later than three 7449
hundred sixty-five days after the expiration of the time for 7450
filing the appeal. 7451
(b) Except as otherwise provided in section 2953.23 of the 7452
Revised Code, a petition under division (A)(1)(a)(iv) of this 7453
section shall be filed not later than three hundred sixty-five 7454
days after the effective date of this amendment 7455
(3)(a) In a petition filed under division (A)(1)(a)(i), 7456
(ii), or (iii) of this section, a person who has been sentenced 7457
to death may ask the court to render void or voidable the 7458
judgment with respect to the conviction of aggravated murder or 7459
the specification of an aggravating circumstance or the sentence 7460
of death. 7461
(b) A person sentenced to death who files a petition under 7462
division (A)(1)(a)(iv) of this section may ask the court to 7463
render void the sentence of death and to order the resentencing 7464
of the person under division (A) of section 2929.06 of the 7465
Revised Code. If a person sentenced to death files such a 7466
petition and asks the court to render void the sentence of death 7467

H. B. No. 72 Page 253
As Introduced
and to order the resentencing of the person under division (A) 7468
of section 2929.06 of the Revised Code, the act of filing the 7469
petition constitutes a waiver of any right to be sentenced under 7470
the law that existed at the time the offense was committed and 7471
constitutes consent to be sentenced to life imprisonment without 7472
parole under division (A) of section 2929.06 of the Revised 7473
Code. 7474
(4)(3) A petitioner shall state in the original or amended 7475
petition filed under division (A) of this section all grounds 7476
for relief claimed by the petitioner. Except as provided in 7477
section 2953.23 of the Revised Code, any ground for relief that 7478
is not so stated in the petition is waived. 7479
(5) (4) If the petitioner in a petition filed under 7480
division (A)(1)(a)(i), (ii), or (iii) (A)(1)(a) of this section 7481
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a felony, the petition may 7482
include a claim that the petitioner was denied the equal 7483
protection of the laws in violation of the Ohio Constitution or 7484
the United States Constitution because the sentence imposed upon 7485
the petitioner for the felony was part of a consistent pattern 7486
of disparity in sentencing by the judge who imposed the 7487
sentence, with regard to the petitioner's race, gender, ethnic 7488
background, or religion. If the supreme court adopts a rule 7489
requiring a court of common pleas to maintain information with 7490
regard to an offender's race, gender, ethnic background, or 7491
religion, the supporting evidence for the petition shall 7492
include, but shall not be limited to, a copy of that type of 7493
information relative to the petitioner's sentence and copies of 7494
that type of information relative to sentences that the same 7495
judge imposed upon other persons. 7496
(6) Notwithstanding any law or court rule to the contrary, 7497

there is no limit on the number of pages in, or on the length 7498
of, a petition filed under division (A)(1)(a)(i), (ii), (iii), 7499
or (iv) of this section by a person who has been sentenced to 7500
death. If any court rule specifies a limit on the number of 7501
pages in, or on the length of, a petition filed under division 7502
(A)(1)(a)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section or on a 7503
prosecuting attorney's response to such a petition by answer or 7504
motion and a person who has been sentenced to death files a 7505
petition that exceeds the limit specified for the petition, the 7506
prosecuting attorney may respond by an answer or motion that 7507
exceeds the limit specified for the response. 7508
(B) The clerk of the court in which the petition for 7509
postconviction relief and, if applicable, a request for 7510
postconviction discovery described in division (A)(1)(e) of this 7511
section is filed shall docket the petition and the request and 7512
bring them it promptly to the attention of the court. The clerk 7513
of the court in which the petition for postconviction relief 7514
and, if applicable, a request for postconviction discovery 7515
described in division (A)(1)(e) of this section is filed 7516
immediately shall forward a copy of the petition and a copy of 7517
the request if filed by the petitioner to the prosecuting 7518
attorney of the county served by the court. If the request for 7519
postconviction discovery is filed by the prosecuting attorney, 7520
the clerk of the court immediately shall forward a copy of the 7521
request to the petitioner or the petitioner's counsel. 7522
(C) If a person who has been sentenced to death and who 7523
files a petition for postconviction relief under division (A)(1) 7524
(a)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section requests a 7525
deposition or the prosecuting attorney in the case requests a 7526
deposition, and if the court grants the request under division 7527
(A)(1)(e) of this section, the court shall notify the petitioner 7528

or the petitioner's counsel and the prosecuting attorney. The 7529
deposition shall be conducted pursuant to divisions (B), (D), 7530
and (E) of Criminal Rule 15. Notwithstanding division (C) of 7531
Criminal Rule 15, the petitioner is not entitled to attend the 7532
deposition. The prosecuting attorney shall be permitted to 7533
attend and participate in any deposition. 7534
(D) The court shall consider a petition that is timely 7535
filed within the period specified in division (A)(2) of this 7536
section even if a direct appeal of the judgment is pending. 7537
Before granting a hearing on a petition filed under division (A) 7538
(1)(a)(i), or (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section, the court 7539
shall determine whether there are substantive grounds for 7540
relief. In making such a determination, the court shall 7541
consider, in addition to the petition, the supporting 7542
affidavits, and the documentary evidence, all the files and 7543
records pertaining to the proceedings against the petitioner, 7544
including, but not limited to, the indictment, the court's 7545
journal entries, the journalized records of the clerk of the 7546
court, and the court reporter's transcript. The court reporter's 7547
transcript, if ordered and certified by the court, shall be 7548
taxed as court costs. If the court dismisses the petition, it 7549
shall make and file findings of fact and conclusions of law with 7550
respect to such dismissal. If the petition was filed by a person 7551
who has been sentenced to death, the findings of fact and 7552
conclusions of law shall state specifically the reasons for the 7553
dismissal of the petition and of each claim it contains. 7554
(E) (D) Within ten days after the docketing of the 7555
petition, or within any further time that the court may fix for 7556
good cause shown, the prosecuting attorney shall respond by 7557
answer or motion. Division (A)(6) of this section applies with 7558
respect to the prosecuting attorney's response. Within twenty 7559

days from the date the issues are raised, either party may move 7560
for summary judgment. The right to summary judgment shall appear 7561
on the face of the record. 7562
(F) (E) Unless the petition and the files and records of 7563
the case show the petitioner is not entitled to relief, the 7564
court shall proceed to a prompt hearing on the issues even if a 7565
direct appeal of the case is pending. If the court notifies the 7566
parties that it has found grounds for granting relief, either 7567
party may request an appellate court in which a direct appeal of 7568
the judgment is pending to remand the pending case to the court. 7569
With respect to a petition filed under division (A)(1)(a) 7570
(iv) of this section, the procedures and rules regarding 7571
introduction of evidence and burden of proof at the pretrial 7572
hearing that are set forth in divisions (C), (D), and (F) of 7573
section 2929.025 of the Revised Code apply in considering the 7574
petition. With respect to such a petition, the grounds for 7575
granting relief are that the person has been diagnosed with one 7576
or more of the conditions set forth in division (A)(1)(a) of 7577
section 2929.025 of the Revised Code and that, at the time of 7578
the aggravated murder that was the basis of the sentence of 7579
death, the condition or conditions significantly impaired the 7580
person's capacity in a manner described in division (A)(1)(b) of 7581
that section. 7582
(G) A petitioner who files a petition under division (A) 7583
(1)(a)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section may amend the 7584
petition as follows: 7585
(1) If the petition was filed by a person who has been 7586
sentenced to death, at any time that is not later than one 7587
hundred eighty days after the petition is filed, the petitioner 7588
may amend the petition with or without leave or prejudice to the 7589

proceedings. 7590
(2) If division (G)(1) of this section does not apply, at 7591
(F) At any time before the answer or motion is filed, the 7592
petitioner may amend the petition with or without leave or 7593
prejudice to the proceedings. 7594
(3) The petitioner may amend the petition with leave of 7595
court at any time after the expiration of the applicable period 7596
specified in division (G)(1) or (2) of this sectionthereafter. 7597
(H) (G) If the court does not find grounds for granting 7598
relief, it shall make and file findings of fact and conclusions 7599
of law and shall enter judgment denying relief on the petition. 7600
If the petition was filed by a person who has been sentenced to 7601
death, the findings of fact and conclusions of law shall state 7602
specifically the reasons for the denial of relief on the 7603
petition and of each claim it contains. If no direct appeal of 7604
the case is pending and the court finds grounds for relief or if 7605
a pending direct appeal of the case has been remanded to the 7606
court pursuant to a request made pursuant to division (F) (E) of 7607
this section and the court finds grounds for granting relief, it 7608
shall make and file findings of fact and conclusions of law and 7609
shall enter a judgment that vacates and sets aside the judgment 7610
in question, and, in the case of a petitioner who is a prisoner 7611
in custody, except as otherwise described in this division, 7612
shall discharge or resentence the petitioner or grant a new 7613
trial as the court determines appropriate. If the court finds 7614
grounds for relief in the case of a petitioner who filed a 7615
petition under division (A)(1)(a)(iv) of this section, the court 7616
shall render void the sentence of death and order the 7617
resentencing of the offender under division (A) of section 7618
2929.06 of the Revised Code. If the petitioner has been 7619

H. B. No. 72 Page 258

sentenced to death, the findings of fact and conclusions of law 7620
shall state specifically the reasons for the finding of grounds 7621
for granting the relief, with respect to each claim contained in 7622
the petition. The court also may make supplementary orders to 7623
the relief granted, concerning such matters as rearraignment, 7624
retrial, custody, and bail. If the trial court's order granting 7625
the petition is reversed on appeal and if the direct appeal of 7626
the case has been remanded from an appellate court pursuant to a 7627
request under division (F) (E) of this section, the appellate 7628
court reversing the order granting the petition shall notify the 7629
appellate court in which the direct appeal of the case was 7630
pending at the time of the remand of the reversal and remand of 7631
the trial court's order. Upon the reversal and remand of the 7632
trial court's order granting the petition, regardless of whether 7633
notice is sent or received, the direct appeal of the case that 7634
was remanded is reinstated. 7635
(I) Upon the filing of a petition pursuant to division (A) 7636
(1)(a)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section by a person 7637
sentenced to death, only the supreme court may stay execution of 7638
the sentence of death. 7639
(J)(1) If a person sentenced to death intends to file a 7640
petition under this section, the court shall appoint counsel to 7641
represent the person upon a finding that the person is indigent 7642
and that the person either accepts the appointment of counsel or 7643
is unable to make a competent decision whether to accept or 7644
reject the appointment of counsel. The court may decline to 7645
appoint counsel for the person only upon a finding, after a 7646
hearing if necessary, that the person rejects the appointment of 7647
counsel and understands the legal consequences of that decision 7648
or upon a finding that the person is not indigent. 7649

H. B. No. 72 Page 259

(2) The court shall not appoint as counsel under division 7650
(J)(1) of this section an attorney who represented the 7651
petitioner at trial in the case to which the petition relates 7652
unless the person and the attorney expressly request the 7653
appointment. The court shall appoint as counsel under division 7654
(J)(1) of this section only an attorney who is certified under 7655
Rule 20 of the Rules of Superintendence for the Courts of Ohio 7656
to represent indigent defendants charged with or convicted of an 7657
offense for which the death penalty can be or has been imposed. 7658
The ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during 7659
proceedings under this section does not constitute grounds for 7660
relief in a proceeding under this section, in an appeal of any 7661
action under this section, or in an application to reopen a 7662
direct appeal. 7663
(3) Division (J) of this section does not preclude 7664
attorneys who represent the state of Ohio from invoking the 7665
provisions of 28 U.S.C. 154 with respect to capital cases that 7666
were pending in federal habeas corpus proceedings prior to July 7667
1, 1996, insofar as the petitioners in those cases were 7668
represented in proceedings under this section by one or more 7669
counsel appointed by the court under this section or section 7670
120.06, 120.16, 120.26, or 120.33 of the Revised Code and those 7671
appointed counsel meet the requirements of division (J)(2) of 7672
this section. 7673
(K) (H) Subject to the appeal of a sentence for a felony 7674
that is authorized by section 2953.08 of the Revised Code, the 7675
remedy set forth in this section is the exclusive remedy by 7676
which a person may bring a collateral challenge to the validity 7677

Sec. 2953.23. (A) Whether a hearing is or is not held on a 7683
petition filed pursuant to section 2953.21 of the Revised Code, 7684
a court may not entertain a petition filed after the expiration 7685
of the period prescribed in division (A) of that section or a 7686
second petition or successive petitions for similar relief on 7687
behalf of a petitioner unless division (A)(1) or (2) of this 7688
section applies: 7689
(1) Both of the following apply: 7690
(a) Either the petitioner shows that the petitioner was 7691
unavoidably prevented from discovery of the facts upon which the 7692
petitioner must rely to present the claim for relief, or, 7693
subsequent to the period prescribed in division (A)(2) of 7694
section 2953.21 of the Revised Code or to the filing of an 7695
earlier petition, the United States Supreme Court recognized a 7696
new federal or state right that applies retroactively to persons 7697
in the petitioner's situation, and the petition asserts a claim 7698
based on that right. 7699
(b) The petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence 7700
that, but for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable 7701
factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense 7702
of which the petitioner was convicted or, if the claim 7703
challenges a sentence of death that, but for constitutional 7704
error at the sentencing hearing, no reasonable factfinder would 7705
have found the petitioner eligible for the death sentence. 7706
(2) The petitioner was convicted of a felony, the 7707
petitioner is an offender for whom DNA testing was performed 7708
under sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code or under 7709

former section 2953.82 of the Revised Code and analyzed in the 7710
context of and upon consideration of all available admissible 7711
evidence related to the inmate's case as described in division 7712
(D) of section 2953.74 of the Revised Code, and the results of 7713
the DNA testing establish, by clear and convincing evidence, 7714
actual innocence of that felony offense or, if the person was 7715
sentenced to death, establish, by clear and convincing evidence, 7716
actual innocence of the aggravating circumstance or 7717
circumstances the person was found guilty of committing and that 7718
is or are the basis of that sentence of death. 7719
As used in this division, "actual innocence" has the same 7720
meaning as in division (A)(1)(c) of section 2953.21 of the 7721
Revised Code, and "former section 2953.82 of the Revised Code" 7722
has the same meaning as in division (A)(1)(d) of section 2953.21 7723
of the Revised Code. 7724
(B) An order awarding or denying relief sought in a 7725
petition filed pursuant to section 2953.21 of the Revised Code 7726
is a final judgment and may be appealed pursuant to Chapter 7727
2953. of the Revised Code. 7728
If a petition filed pursuant to section 2953.21 of the 7729
Revised Code by a person who has been sentenced to death is 7730
denied and the person appeals the judgment, notwithstanding any 7731
law or court rule to the contrary, there is no limit on the 7732
number of pages in, or on the length of, a notice of appeal or 7733
briefs related to an appeal filed by the person. If any court 7734
rule specifies a limit on the number of pages in, or on the 7735
length of, a notice of appeal or briefs described in this 7736
division or on a prosecuting attorney's response or briefs with 7737
respect to such an appeal and a person who has been sentenced to 7738
death files a notice of appeal or briefs that exceed the limit 7739

H. B. No. 72 Page 262

specified for the petition, the prosecuting attorney may file a 7740
response or briefs that exceed the limit specified for the 7741
answer or briefs. 7742

a DNA sample, a record or other evidence that tracks the DNA 7757
sample from the time it was first obtained until it currently 7758
exists in its place of storage. For purposes of this division, 7759
examples of when biological material or a DNA sample is first 7760
obtained include, but are not limited to, obtaining the material 7761
or sample at the scene of a crime, from a victim, from an 7762
offender, or in any other manner or time as is appropriate in 7763
the facts and circumstances present. 7764

(G) "Exclusion" or "exclusion result" means a result of 7773
DNA testing that scientifically precludes or forecloses the 7774
subject offender as a contributor of biological material 7775
recovered from the crime scene or victim in question, in 7776
relation to the offense for which the offender is an eligible 7777
offender and for which the sentence of death or prison term was 7778
imposed upon the offender. 7779
(H) "Extracting personnel" means medically approved 7780
personnel who are employed to physically obtain an offender's 7781

to 2953.81 of the Revised Code. 7783
(I) "Inclusion" or "inclusion result" means a result of 7784
DNA testing that scientifically cannot exclude, or that holds 7785
accountable, the subject offender as a contributor of biological 7786

offender and for which the sentence of death or prison term was 7789
imposed upon the offender. 7790

DNA testing of the subject offender been presented at the trial 7798
of the subject offender requesting DNA testing and been found 7799
relevant and admissible with respect to the felony offense for 7800
which the offender is an eligible offender and is requesting the 7801
DNA testing, and had those results been analyzed in the context 7802
of and upon consideration of all available admissible evidence 7803
related to the offender's case as described in division (D) of 7804
section 2953.74 of the Revised Code, there is a strong 7805
probability that no reasonable factfinder would have found the 7806
offender guilty of that offense or, if the offender was 7807
sentenced to death relative to that offense, would have found 7808
the offender guilty of the aggravating circumstance or 7809
circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing and 7810
that is or are the basis of that sentence of death. 7811
(M) "Parent sample" means the biological material first 7812
obtained from a crime scene or a victim of an offense for which 7813
an offender is an eligible offender, and from which a sample 7814
will be presently taken to do a DNA comparison to the DNA of the 7815
subject offender under sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the 7816
Revised Code. 7817
(N) "Prison" and "community control sanction" have the 7818
same meanings as in section 2929.01 of the Revised Code. 7819
(O) "Prosecuting attorney" means the prosecuting attorney 7820

(R) "Testing authority" means a laboratory at which DNA 7830
testing will be conducted under sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of 7831
the Revised Code. 7832
(S) "Parole" and "post-release control" have the same 7833
meanings as in section 2967.01 of the Revised Code. 7834
(T) "Sexually oriented offense" and "child-victim oriented 7835
offense" have the same meanings as in section 2950.01 of the 7836
Revised Code. 7837
(U) "Definitive DNA test" means a DNA test that clearly 7838
establishes that biological material from the perpetrator of the 7839
crime was recovered from the crime scene and also clearly 7840
establishes whether or not the biological material is that of 7841
the eligible offender. A prior DNA test is not definitive if the 7842
eligible offender proves by a preponderance of the evidence that 7843
because of advances in DNA technology there is a possibility of 7844
discovering new biological material from the perpetrator that 7845
the prior DNA test may have failed to discover. Prior testing 7846
may have been a prior "definitive DNA test" as to some 7847
biological evidence but may not have been a prior "definitive 7848
DNA test" as to other biological evidence. 7849
Sec. 2953.72. (A) Any eligible offender who wishes to 7850
request DNA testing under sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the 7851
Revised Code shall submit an application for the testing to the 7852
court of common pleas specified in section 2953.73 of the 7853
Revised Code, on a form prescribed by the attorney general for 7854
this purpose. The eligible offender shall submit the application 7855

H. B. No. 72 Page 266
As Introduced
in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 2953.73 7856
of the Revised Code. The eligible offender shall specify on the 7857
application the offense or offenses for which the offender is an 7858
eligible offender and is requesting the DNA testing. Along with 7859
the application, the eligible offender shall submit an 7860
acknowledgment that is on a form prescribed by the attorney 7861
general for this purpose and that is signed by the offender. The 7862
acknowledgment shall set forth all of the following: 7863
(1) That sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code 7864
contemplate applications for DNA testing of an eligible offender 7865
at a stage of a prosecution or case after the offender has been 7866
sentenced, that any exclusion or inclusion result of DNA testing 7867
rendered pursuant to those sections may be used by a party in 7868
any proceeding as described in section 2953.81 of the Revised 7869
Code, and that all requests for any DNA testing made at trial 7870
will continue to be handled by the prosecuting attorney in the 7871
case; 7872
(2) That the process of conducting postconviction DNA 7873
testing for an eligible offender under sections 2953.71 to 7874
2953.81 of the Revised Code begins when the offender submits an 7875
application under section 2953.73 of the Revised Code and the 7876
acknowledgment described in this section; 7877
(3) That the eligible offender must submit the application 7878
and acknowledgment to the court of common pleas that heard the 7879
case in which the offender was convicted of the offense for 7880
which the offender is an eligible offender and is requesting the 7881
DNA testing; 7882
(4) That the state has established a set of criteria set 7883
forth in section 2953.74 of the Revised Code by which eligible 7884
offender applications for DNA testing will be screened and that 7885

H. B. No. 72 Page 267
As Introduced
a judge of a court of common pleas upon receipt of a properly 7886
filed application and accompanying acknowledgment will apply 7887
those criteria to determine whether to accept or reject the 7888
application; 7889
(5) That the results of DNA testing conducted under 7890
sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code will be provided 7891
as described in section 2953.81 of the Revised Code to all 7892
parties in the postconviction proceedings and will be reported 7893
to various courts; 7894
(6) That, if DNA testing is conducted with respect to an 7895
offender under sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code, 7896
the state will not offer the offender a retest if an inclusion 7897
result is achieved relative to the testing and that, if the 7898
state were to offer a retest after an inclusion result, the 7899
policy would create an atmosphere in which endless testing could 7900
occur and in which postconviction proceedings could be stalled 7901
for many years; 7902
(7) That, if the court rejects an eligible offender's 7903
application for DNA testing because the offender does not 7904
satisfy the acceptance criteria described in division (A)(4) of 7905
this section, the court will not accept or consider subsequent 7906
applications; 7907
(8) That the acknowledgment memorializes the provisions of 7908
sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code with respect to 7909
the application of postconviction DNA testing to offenders, that 7910
those provisions do not give any offender any additional 7911
constitutional right that the offender did not already have, 7912
that the court has no duty or obligation to provide 7913
postconviction DNA testing to offenders, that the court of 7914
common pleas has the sole discretion subject to an appeal as 7915

H. B. No. 72 Page 268
As Introduced
described in this division to determine whether an offender is 7916
an eligible offender and whether an eligible offender's 7917
application for DNA testing satisfies the acceptance criteria 7918
described in division (A)(4) of this section and whether the 7919
application should be accepted or rejected, that if the court of 7920
common pleas rejects an eligible offender's application, the 7921
offender may seek leave of the supreme court to appeal the 7922
rejection to that court if the offender was sentenced to death 7923
for the offense for which the offender is requesting the DNA 7924
testing and, if the offender was not sentenced to death for that 7925
offense, may appeal the rejection to the court of appeals, and 7926
that no determination otherwise made by the court of common 7927
pleas in the exercise of its discretion regarding the 7928
eligibility of an offender or regarding postconviction DNA 7929
testing under those provisions is reviewable by or appealable to 7930
any court; 7931
(9) That the manner in which sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 7932
of the Revised Code with respect to the offering of 7933
postconviction DNA testing to offenders are carried out does not 7934
confer any constitutional right upon any offender, that the 7935
state has established guidelines and procedures relative to 7936
those provisions to ensure that they are carried out with both 7937
justice and efficiency in mind, and that an offender who 7938
participates in any phase of the mechanism contained in those 7939
provisions, including, but not limited to, applying for DNA 7940
testing and being rejected, having an application for DNA 7941
testing accepted and not receiving the test, or having DNA 7942
testing conducted and receiving unfavorable results, does not 7943
gain as a result of the participation any constitutional right 7944
to challenge, or, except as provided in division (A)(8) of this 7945
section, any right to any review or appeal of, the manner in 7946

H. B. No. 72 Page 269
As Introduced
which those provisions are carried out; 7947
(10) That the most basic aspect of sections 2953.71 to 7948
2953.81 of the Revised Code is that, in order for DNA testing to 7949
occur, there must be an offender sample against which other 7950
evidence may be compared, that, if an eligible offender's 7951
application is accepted but the offender subsequently refuses to 7952
submit to the collection of the sample of biological material 7953
from the offender or hinders the state from obtaining a sample 7954
of biological material from the offender, the goal of those 7955
provisions will be frustrated, and that an offender's refusal or 7956
hindrance shall cause the court to rescind its prior acceptance 7957
of the application for DNA testing for the offender and deny the 7958
application. 7959
(B) The attorney general shall prescribe a form to be used 7960
to make an application for DNA testing under division (A) of 7961
this section and section 2953.73 of the Revised Code and a form 7962
to be used to provide the acknowledgment described in division 7963
(A) of this section. The forms shall include all information 7964
described in division (A) of this section, spaces for an 7965
offender to insert all information necessary to complete the 7966
forms, including, but not limited to, specifying the offense or 7967
offenses for which the offender is an eligible offender and is 7968
requesting the DNA testing, and any other information or 7969
material the attorney general determines is necessary or 7970
relevant. The attorney general shall distribute copies of the 7971
prescribed forms to the department of rehabilitation and 7972
correction, the department shall ensure that each prison in 7973
which offenders are housed has a supply of copies of the forms, 7974
and the department shall ensure that copies of the forms are 7975
provided free of charge to any offender who requests them. 7976

control regarding that felony, or has been released from that 7989
prison term and is under a community control sanction regarding 7990
that felony. 7991
(ii) The offender was not sentenced to a prison term or 7992
sentence of death for the felony described in division (C)(1)(a) 7993
of this section, but was sentenced to a community control 7994
sanction for that felony and is under that community control 7995
sanction. 7996
(iii) The felony described in division (C)(1)(a) of this 7997
section was a sexually oriented offense or child-victim oriented 7998
offense, and the offender has a duty to comply with sections 7999
2950.04, 2950.041, 2950.05, and 2950.06 of the Revised Code 8000
relative to that felony. 8001

which the eligible offender was convicted of the offense for 8024
which the offender is requesting DNA testing, or, if that judge 8025
no longer is a judge of that court, it shall be assigned 8026
according to court rules. The judge to whom the application is 8027
assigned shall decide the application. The application shall 8028

the determination, shall consider the application, the 8052
supporting affidavits, and the documentary evidence and, in 8053
addition to those materials, shall consider all the files and 8054
records pertaining to the proceedings against the applicant, 8055
including, but not limited to, the indictment, the court's 8056
journal entries, the journalized records of the clerk of the 8057

the application filed under division (C) of this section by a 8059
prosecuting attorney or the attorney general, unless the 8060
application and the files and records show the applicant is not 8061
entitled to DNA testing, in which case the application may be 8062
denied. The court is not required to conduct an evidentiary 8063
hearing in conducting its review of, and in making its 8064
determination as to whether to accept or reject, the 8065

application. Upon making its determination, the court shall 8066
enter a judgment and order that either accepts or rejects the 8067
application and that includes within the judgment and order the 8068
reasons for the acceptance or rejection as applied to the 8069
criteria and procedures set forth in sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 8070
of the Revised Code. The court shall send a copy of the judgment 8071

(E) A judgment and order of a court entered under division 8074
(D) of this section is appealable only as provided in this 8075
division. If an eligible offender submits an application for DNA 8076
testing under section 2953.73 of the Revised Code and the court 8077
of common pleas rejects the application under division (D) of 8078
this section, one of the following applies: 8079
(1) If the offender was sentenced to death for the offense 8080
for which the offender claims to be an eligible offender and is 8081
requesting DNA testing, the offender may seek leave of the 8082
supreme court to appeal the rejection to the supreme court. 8083
Courts of appeals do not have jurisdiction to review any 8084
rejection if the offender was sentenced to death for the offense 8085
for which the offender claims to be an eligible offender and is 8086
requesting DNA testing. 8087
(2) If the offender was not sentenced to death for the 8088
offense for which the offender claims to be an eligible offender 8089
and is requesting DNA testing, the rejection is a final 8090
appealable order, and the offender may appeal it to the court of 8091
appeals of the district in which is located that court of common 8092

extent that institutional confinement does not offer additional 8170
restrictions, that is likely to continue throughout the entire 8171
period of parole, and that is unlikely to improve noticeably. 8172
(b) "Medically incapacitated" does not include conditions 8173
related solely to mental illness unless the mental illness is 8174

longer terminally ill, medically incapacitated, or in imminent 8199
danger of death, the inmate shall be returned, by order of the 8200
governor, to the institution from which the inmate was released. 8201
If the inmate violates any rules or conditions applicable to the 8202
inmate, the inmate may be returned to an institution under the 8203

director's designee approves the offender for transfer or 9520

a date certain for release is set under this division is not 9531
transferred to or exchanged with the foreign country pursuant to 9532
the treaty, the date certain is null and void, and the 9533
