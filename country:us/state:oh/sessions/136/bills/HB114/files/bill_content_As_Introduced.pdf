If the school operates a program that uses the Montessori 25

hundred fifty-five hours of learning opportunities per school 35

students that does not exceed the capacity of the school's 84

(H) The department shall adjust the amounts paid under 249

community school for the period of time beginning on the later 264
of the date on which the school both has received documentation 265
of the student's enrollment from a parent and the student has 266
commenced participation in learning opportunities as defined in 267
the contract with the sponsor, or thirty days prior to the date 268
on which the student is entered into the education management 269
information system established under section 3301.0714 of the 270

divisions (H)(3) and (4) of this section to a community school 272
student, "learning opportunities" shall be defined in the 273
contract, which shall describe both classroom-based and non- 274

this chapter. 290
Except as otherwise specified in this paragraph, beginning 291
in the 2011-2012 school year, any student who completed the 292
prior school year in an internet- or computer-based community 293
school shall be considered to be enrolled in the same school in 294
the subsequent school year until the student's enrollment has 295
ceased as specified in division (H)(2) of this section. The 296
department shall continue paying amounts for the student under 297
section 3317.022 of the Revised Code without interruption at the 298
start of the subsequent school year. However, if the student 299
without a legitimate excuse fails to participate in the first 300
seventy-two consecutive hours of learning opportunities offered 301
to the student in that subsequent school year, the student shall 302
be considered not to have re-enrolled in the school for that 303
school year and the department shall recalculate the payments to 304
the school for that school year to account for the fact that the 305
student is not enrolled. 306
(3) The department shall determine each community school 307
student's percentage of full-time equivalency based on the 308

H. B. No. 114 Page 12
As Introduced
percentage of learning opportunities offered by the community 309
school to that student, reported either as number of hours or 310
number of days, is of the total learning opportunities offered 311
by the community school to a student who attends for the 312
school's entire school year. However, no internet- or computer- 313
based community school shall be credited for any time a student 314
spends participating in learning opportunities beyond ten hours 315
within any period of twenty-four consecutive hours. Whether it 316
reports hours or days of learning opportunities, each community 317
school shall offer not less than nine hundred twenty hours of 318
learning opportunities during the school year. 319
(4) With respect to the calculation of full-time 320
equivalency under division (H)(3) of this section, the 321
department shall waive the number of hours or days of learning 322
opportunities not offered to a student because the community 323
school was closed during the school year due to disease 324
epidemic, hazardous weather conditions, law enforcement 325
emergencies, inoperability of school buses or other equipment 326
necessary to the school's operation, damage to a school 327
building, or other temporary circumstances due to utility 328
failure rendering the school building unfit for school use, so 329
long as the school was actually open for instruction with 330
students in attendance during that school year for not less than 331
the minimum number of hours required by this chapter. The 332
department shall treat the school as if it were open for 333
instruction with students in attendance during the hours or days 334
waived under this division. 335
(I) The department of education and workforce shall reduce 336
the amounts paid under section 3317.022 of the Revised Code to 337
reflect payments made to colleges under section 3365.07 of the 338

section 3314.22 of the Revised Code, relative to such student. 353
(2) In accordance with policies adopted by the department 354
of education and workforce, in consultation with the auditor of 355
state, the department shall reduce the amounts otherwise payable 356
under section 3317.022 of the Revised Code to any community 357
school that includes in its program the provision of computer 358
hardware and software materials to any student, if such hardware 359
and software materials have not been delivered, installed, and 360
activated for each such student in a timely manner or other 361
educational materials or services have not been provided 362
according to the contract between the individual community 363
