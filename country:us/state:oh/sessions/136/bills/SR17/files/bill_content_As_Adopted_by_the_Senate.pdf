senator who no longer is a member of the General Assembly may 408
present a writing to the Clerk requesting deletion of the former 409
senator's name from the title of the bill as sponsor or co- 410

Journal. When the Senate is agreed, the Clerk shall make out the 413
title accordingly, and certify to the passage of the bill upon 414
its carrier. 415
Immediately after the Senate has voted to concur in House 416
amendments to a bill or resolution, and immediately after the 417
Senate has voted to accept a conference committee report, the 418
President shall demand if the Senate agrees to the co- 419
sponsorship of the bill or resolution. Any senator may then 420
request the addition or deletion of a senator's name from the 421
bill or resolution as co-sponsor. Prior to the vote on 422
concurrence in House amendments to a bill or resolution, and 423
prior to the vote on a conference committee report, a former 424
senator who no longer is a member of the General Assembly may 425
present a writing to the Clerk requesting deletion of the former 426
senator's name from the bill or resolution as sponsor or co- 427
sponsor. The President shall present the request to the Senate, 428
and the Clerk shall spread the request upon the pages of the 429
Journal. When the Senate is agreed, the Clerk shall make out the 430

without waiting for the return to the Senate of such bill, joint 748
resolution, or other paper, and the President shall state the 749
question: "Shall the vote be reconsidered?" Action on the bill, 750
joint resolution, or other paper, the vote on which has been 751

shall be termed a recess, and on the reassembling at the 778
appointed hour any question pending at the time of taking such 779
recess shall be resumed without a motion to that effect; and 780
unless the Senate shall otherwise order by resolution or motion, 781
the hour to which it shall adjourn shall be half past one p.m. 782

S. R. No. 17 Page 27
As Adopted by the Senate
and no rule shall be altered, except by a three-fifths vote of 801
the senators elected. Any of these rules may be suspended by a 802
three-fifths vote of the members elected, excepting rules which 803
specifically require otherwise. 804
Rule 99. (Parliamentary Guide.) Mason's Manual of 805
Legislative Procedure (2020 edition) shall be used by the Senate 806
as authority in all cases not provided for in the Senate Rules 807
or the Joint Rules of the Senate and House of Representatives, 808
if any. 809
Rule 100. (Committee on Rules and Reference.) The standing 810
Committee on Rules and Reference shall have the power to 811
prescribe the order of business of the Senate and shall arrange 812
and post the calendar at least one calendar day in advance. 813
Measures expected to be reported by committee may be placed 814
conditionally on the calendar for consideration by the Senate in 815
the regular order of business, and may be carried over to a 816
succeeding legislative day, subject to favorable action by 817
committee. In a case of necessity, the Chairperson of the 818
Committee on Rules and Reference may call a special meeting upon 819
proper notice to add a bill to the calendar upon a majority 820
vote. One day's notice shall not be required for calendars 821
during the first week after an adjournment of more than five 822

EXECUTIVE APPOINTMENTS 824
Rule 101. (Executive Appointments.) When executive 825

the appointments to another committee. 829
Rule 102. (Yeas and Nays, Appointments.) The yeas and nays 830
shall be called upon advising and consenting to an executive 831
appointment. Failure of the question to receive the concurrence 832

S. R. No. 17 Page 28
As Adopted by the Senate
of a majority of the senators elected constitutes refusal of the 833
Senate to advise and consent to the appointment. The Senate may 834
advise and consent to two or more appointments by a single roll 835
call vote. When a committee to which an appointment has been 836
referred recommends its rejection, or when a senator demands 837
that an appointment be separately considered, the question of 838
its approval shall not be included in a single roll call vote 839
affecting more than one appointment, but the yeas and nays shall 840
be separately called on the question of advising and consenting 841
to such an appointment. When two or more appointments are made 842
the subject of a single roll call vote, the failure of the 843
question to receive the concurrence of a majority of the 844
senators elected shall not constitute refusal to advise and 845
consent to the appointments, but in such case the yeas and nays 846
shall then be separately called on the question of advising and 847
consenting to each appointment. 848
DUTIES OF OFFICERS 849
Rule 103. (Clerk Shall Keep Index to Bills, etc.) The Clerk 850
shall keep an index record of all bills and resolutions 851
introduced in the Senate regardless of the house of origin, 852
showing the number, title, and author of each measure, the 853
section sought to be amended, enacted, or repealed, and the 854
subject or matter affected thereby. The Clerk may call upon the 855
staff of the Ohio Government Telecommunications to produce a 856
video of all Senate voting sessions. Such video shall be 857
accessible as provided by law and the rules of the Ohio 858
Government Telecommunications Programming Committee. 859
Rule 104. (Duties of Clerk.) The distribution and receipt 860
of bills, resolutions, reports, messages from the House and from 861

the direction and control of the Clerk. All records kept by the 864
