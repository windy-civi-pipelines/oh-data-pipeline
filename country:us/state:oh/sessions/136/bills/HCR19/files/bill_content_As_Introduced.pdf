As Introduced
WHEREAS, The Framers of the United States Constitution 21
recognized the role of the states in structuring election laws 22
and mechanisms, understanding that a one-size-fits-all federal 23
approach is neither necessary nor desirable; and 24
WHEREAS, The people of Ohio and other states have a vested 25
interest in ensuring that their electoral processes remain 26
responsive to their needs and are free from disproportionate 27
influence by foreign entities or individuals that may not 28
reflect the priorities of the electorate; and 29
WHEREAS, The principle of self-governance requires that 30
states retain the ability to establish laws governing the 31
influence of money in elections, consistent with their unique 32
circumstances and policy considerations; and 33
WHEREAS, The constitutional amendment process provides an 34
avenue for reaffirming the role of the states in overseeing 35
elections and ensuring that their authority in this realm is 36
preserved; now therefore be it 37
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the 136th General 38
Assembly of the State of Ohio, call upon the seventeen members 39
representing Ohio in the United States Congress to uphold the 40
principles of federalism and to be proponents of appropriate 41
action, including, if necessary, a constitutional amendment that 42
affirms the authority of states to govern their election 43
processes and establishes the ability of the states to enact 44
policies regarding campaign finance and election influence, in a 45
manner consistent with established constitutional principles; 46
and be it further 47
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives 48
transmit duly authenticated copies of this resolution to the 49
members of the Ohio Congressional delegation, and the news media 50
of Ohio. 51
