Regular Session S. R. No. 97

Senator Weinstein
A R E S O L U T I O N
Observing April 2025 as the Month of the Military
Child in Ohio.
WHEREAS, The members of the Senate of the 136th General Assembly 1
of Ohio are pleased to recognize the Month of the Military Child in 2
Ohio, April 2025; and 3
WHEREAS, In an effort to increase public knowledge and 4
understanding of the issues surrounding children who have a parent in 5
the military, the month of April was first designated by then U.S. 6
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger as the Month of the Military 7
Child in 1986. The children of U.S. Armed Forces members are deserving 8
of profound admiration for their strength of character; and 9
WHEREAS, As Americans enjoy the freedom and democracy that service 10
men and women help to perpetuate, we feel the deepest respect for 11
military families in their own right as individuals who have imparted 12
a stalwart sense of patriotic duty and who have accepted the risks of 13
service with dignity and courage. There are those who take for granted 14
our precious rights and privileges, never adequately considering the 15
enormous personal costs so frequently exacted in conjunction with the 16
fulfillment of military obligations. We owe it to military families, 17
especially their children, who may move many times throughout their 18
lives, bear the burden of a parent being in harmâ€™s way, and endure 19
long separations from their parent, to remain keenly aware of how 20
dearly our nation has always paid for its liberty and its ideals; and 21
WHEREAS, Childhood is a formative time, and family members, 22
together with communities, educators, public officials, and faith- 23
based organizations, play important roles in helping to ensure that 24
children grow up in a safe and stable environment, one that provides 25
nurturing love and encouragement. All Ohioans share the responsibility 26
