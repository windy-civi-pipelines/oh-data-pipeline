surrounding area, and through its generous efforts, it has earned the 17
gratitude and respect of the many citizens it has so capably served; 18

WHEREAS, An occasion such as this is an important milestone which 20
represents dedication and commitment. For a century and a quarter, the 21
members of St. Mary’s Byzantine Catholic Church have kept their faith 22
alive in the community, and on this special anniversary, the 23
congregation has accepted the challenge of carrying its beliefs into 24
the future; therefore be it 25
