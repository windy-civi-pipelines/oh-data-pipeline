sanction of reimbursement imposed upon an offender pursuant to 430
this section for costs incurred by a private provider of 431

purposes of the collection as the judgment debtor. Imposition of 449
a financial sanction and execution on the judgment does not 450
preclude any other power of the court to impose or enforce 451
sanctions on the offender. Once the financial sanction is 452
imposed as a judgment or order under this division, the victim, 453
or parent, legal custodian, or guardian of a surviving minor 454
child of the victim if division (A)(2) of this section applies, 455

2125.05 of the Revised Code to require a felony 2
offender of an OVI-caused aggravated vehicular 3
homicide to pay child maintenance when the 4
victim is a parent, legal guardian, or custodian 5
of a minor child, to allow child maintenance to 6
be awarded in a wrongful death action when the 7
offender is deceased, and to name this act the 8
Sam Knisley Family Support Act. 9
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF OHIO:
Section 1. That section 2929.18 be amended and section 10
2125.05 of the Revised Code be enacted to read as follows: 11
Sec. 2125.05. (A) In addition to compensatory damages, a 12
court may award child maintenance in a civil action for wrongful 13
death in a case in which both of the following apply: 14
(1) The wrongful death is found to have been proximately 15
caused by the deceased defendant's felony violation of division 16
(A)(1) of section 2903.06 of the Revised Code. 17
(2) At the time of death, the deceased victim was the 18

H. B. No. 336 Page 2
As Introduced
parent of at least one surviving minor child. 19
(B) For each minor child of the victim, the court may 20
order the payment of child maintenance until the child reaches 21
eighteen years of age. 22
(C) The court shall calculate the amount of child 23
maintenance in accordance with the basic child support schedule, 24
the applicable worksheet, and the other provisions of Chapter 25
3119. of the Revised Code as if the deceased defendant were a 26
parent subject to a child support order under that chapter. 27
(D) The court shall order that child maintenance payments 28
be made from the defendant's estate to the clerk of courts as 29
trustee for remittance to the child's surviving parent. The 30
clerk shall remit the payments to the surviving parent within 31
three business days of receipt by the clerk. The clerk shall 32
deposit all payments not later than the next business day after 33
receipt. 34
(E) For purposes of this section, "parent" includes a 35
legal custodian or guardian of a child. 36
Sec. 2929.18. (A) Except as otherwise provided in this 37
division and in addition to imposing court costs pursuant to 38
section 2947.23 of the Revised Code, the court imposing a 39
sentence upon an offender for a felony may sentence the offender 40
to any financial sanction or combination of financial sanctions 41
authorized under this section or, in the circumstances specified 42
in section 2929.32 of the Revised Code, may impose upon the 43
offender a fine in accordance with that section, and shall 44
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this 45
section and section 2929.281 of the Revised Code. The victim has 46
a right not to seek restitution. Financial However, the court 47

H. B. No. 336 Page 3
As Introduced
shall order the financial sanction specified in division (A)(2) 48
of this section, if applicable, in addition to any other 49
financial sanction or combination of financial sanctions imposed 50
under this section. Subject to division (A)(2) of this section, 51
financial sanctions that either are required to be or may be 52
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited 53
to, the following: 54
(1) Restitution by the offender to the victim of the 55
offender's criminal offense or the victim's estate, in an amount 56
based on the victim's economic loss. In open court, the court 57
shall order that full restitution be made to the victim, to the 58
adult probation department that serves the county on behalf of 59
the victim, to the clerk of courts, or to another agency 60
designated by the court. At sentencing, the court shall 61
determine the amount of restitution to be made by the offender. 62
The victim, victim's representative, victim's attorney, if 63
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor's designee, and the 64
offender may provide information relevant to the determination 65
of the amount of restitution. The amount the court orders as 66
restitution shall not exceed the amount of the economic loss 67
suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the 68
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for 69
the cost of accounting or auditing done to determine the extent 70
of economic loss, the court may order restitution for any amount 71
of the victim's costs of accounting or auditing provided that 72
the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not exceed the 73
value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of 74
the offense. The court shall hold a hearing on restitution if 75
the offender, victim, victim's representative, or victim's 76
estate disputes the amount. The court shall determine the amount 77
of full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence. All 78

H. B. No. 336 Page 4
As Introduced
restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of 79
economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the 80
victim's estate against the offender. 81
The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge of 82
not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution 83
otherwise ordered to the entity responsible for collecting and 84
processing restitution payments. 85
The victim, victim's estate, or victim's attorney, if 86
applicable, may file a motion or request that the prosecutor in 87
the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for 88
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If 89
the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as 90
it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of 91
restitution ordered, except as provided in division (A) of 92
section 2929.281 of the Revised Code. The court shall not 93
discharge restitution until it is fully paid by the offender. 94
(2) Except (2)(a) For any felony violation of division (A) 95
(1) of section 2903.06 of the Revised Code, the court shall 96
order restitution in the form of child maintenance if the 97
offender was convicted of or pleaded guilty to that violation 98
and at the time of the offense the deceased victim was the 99
parent, legal custodian, or guardian of at least one surviving 100
minor child. For each minor child of the victim, the offender 101
shall pay child maintenance until the child reaches eighteen 102
years of age. 103
(b) The court shall calculate the amount of child 104
maintenance in accordance with the basic child support schedule, 105
the applicable worksheet, and the other provisions of Chapter 106
3119. of the Revised Code as if the offender were a parent 107
subject to a child support order under that chapter. 108

H. B. No. 336 Page 5
As Introduced
(c) The court shall order that child maintenance payments 109
be made to the clerk of courts as trustee for remittance to the 110
child's surviving parent, legal custodian, or guardian. The 111
clerk shall remit the payments to the surviving parent, legal 112
custodian, or guardian within three business days of receipt by 113
the clerk. The clerk shall deposit all payments not later than 114
the next business day after receipt. 115
(d) If the offender is ordered to pay child maintenance 116
under this section and is incarcerated and unable to pay the 117
required child maintenance, the offender shall have not more 118
than one year after the release from incarceration to begin 119
payment and shall enter a payment plan with the court to address 120
any arrearage. If the child maintenance payments are set to 121
terminate but the offender's obligation is not paid in full, the 122
child maintenance payments shall continue until the entire 123
arrearage is paid. 124
(e) If a parent, legal guardian, or custodian brings a 125
civil action against the offender prior to the ordering of child 126
maintenance under this section and obtains a judgment covering 127
the costs of child maintenance in the civil action, no child 128
maintenance shall be ordered under this section. 129
(f) If an offender is ordered to pay child maintenance 130
under this section and a parent, legal guardian, or custodian 131
subsequently brings a civil action against the offender and 132
obtains a civil judgment covering the costs of child 133
maintenance, the amount of restitution in the form of child 134
maintenance shall be reduced by the amount of the judgment 135
awarded in the civil action. 136
