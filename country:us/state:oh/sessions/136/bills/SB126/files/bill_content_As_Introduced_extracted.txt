Section 1. That section 5739.02 of the Revised Code be 6
amended to read as follows: 7
Sec. 5739.02. For the purpose of providing revenue with 8
which to meet the needs of the state, for the use of the general 9
revenue fund of the state, for the purpose of securing a 10
thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the 11
state, for the purpose of affording revenues, in addition to 12
those from general property taxes, permitted under 13
constitutional limitations, and from other sources, for the 14
support of local governmental functions, and for the purpose of 15
reimbursing the state for the expense of administering this 16
chapter, an excise tax is hereby levied on each retail sale made 17
in this state. 18
(A)(1) The tax shall be collected as provided in section 19

Section 3:
5739.025 of the Revised Code. The rate of the tax shall be five 20

and three-fourths per cent. The tax applies and is collectible 21
when the sale is made, regardless of the time when the price is 22
paid or delivered. 23
(2) In the case of the lease or rental, with a fixed term 24
of more than thirty days or an indefinite term with a minimum 25
period of more than thirty days, of any motor vehicles designed 26
by the manufacturer to carry a load of not more than one ton, 27
watercraft, outboard motor, or aircraft, or of any tangible 28
personal property, other than motor vehicles designed by the 29
manufacturer to carry a load of more than one ton, to be used by 30
the lessee or renter primarily for business purposes, the tax 31
shall be collected by the vendor at the time the lease or rental 32
is consummated and shall be calculated by the vendor on the 33
basis of the total amount to be paid by the lessee or renter 34
under the lease agreement. If the total amount of the 35
consideration for the lease or rental includes amounts that are 36
not calculated at the time the lease or rental is executed, the 37
tax shall be calculated and collected by the vendor at the time 38
such amounts are billed to the lessee or renter. In the case of 39
an open-end lease or rental, the tax shall be calculated by the 40
vendor on the basis of the total amount to be paid during the 41
initial fixed term of the lease or rental, and for each 42
subsequent renewal period as it comes due. As used in this 43
division, "motor vehicle" has the same meaning as in section 44

the tax shall be calculated and paid on the basis of the entire 50
length of the lease period, including any renewal periods, until 51

the termination penalty or similar provision no longer applies. 52
The taxpayer shall bear the burden, by a preponderance of the 53
evidence, that the transaction or series of transactions is not 54
a sham transaction. 55
(3) Except as provided in division (A)(2) of this section, 56
in the case of a sale, the price of which consists in whole or 57
in part of the lease or rental of tangible personal property, 58
the tax shall be measured by the installments of that lease or 59
rental. 60
(4) In the case of a sale of a physical fitness facility 61
service or recreation and sports club service, the price of 62

Raw Text:
As Introduced
136th General Assembly
Regular Session S. B. No. 126
2025-2026
Senators Wilkin, Lang
To amend section 5739.02 of the Revised Code to 1
exempt from sales and use tax items purchased by 2
a logistics business to transport manufactured 3
products, general merchandise, and grocery 4
products. 5
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF OHIO:
Section 1. That section 5739.02 of the Revised Code be 6
amended to read as follows: 7
Sec. 5739.02. For the purpose of providing revenue with 8
which to meet the needs of the state, for the use of the general 9
revenue fund of the state, for the purpose of securing a 10
thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the 11
state, for the purpose of affording revenues, in addition to 12
those from general property taxes, permitted under 13
constitutional limitations, and from other sources, for the 14
support of local governmental functions, and for the purpose of 15
reimbursing the state for the expense of administering this 16
chapter, an excise tax is hereby levied on each retail sale made 17
in this state. 18
(A)(1) The tax shall be collected as provided in section 19
5739.025 of the Revised Code. The rate of the tax shall be five 20

S. B. No. 126 Page 2
As Introduced
and three-fourths per cent. The tax applies and is collectible 21
when the sale is made, regardless of the time when the price is 22
paid or delivered. 23
(2) In the case of the lease or rental, with a fixed term 24
of more than thirty days or an indefinite term with a minimum 25
period of more than thirty days, of any motor vehicles designed 26
by the manufacturer to carry a load of not more than one ton, 27
watercraft, outboard motor, or aircraft, or of any tangible 28
personal property, other than motor vehicles designed by the 29
manufacturer to carry a load of more than one ton, to be used by 30
the lessee or renter primarily for business purposes, the tax 31
shall be collected by the vendor at the time the lease or rental 32
is consummated and shall be calculated by the vendor on the 33
basis of the total amount to be paid by the lessee or renter 34
under the lease agreement. If the total amount of the 35
consideration for the lease or rental includes amounts that are 36
not calculated at the time the lease or rental is executed, the 37
tax shall be calculated and collected by the vendor at the time 38
such amounts are billed to the lessee or renter. In the case of 39
an open-end lease or rental, the tax shall be calculated by the 40
vendor on the basis of the total amount to be paid during the 41
initial fixed term of the lease or rental, and for each 42
subsequent renewal period as it comes due. As used in this 43
division, "motor vehicle" has the same meaning as in section 44
4501.01 of the Revised Code, and "watercraft" includes an 45
outdrive unit attached to the watercraft. 46
A lease with a renewal clause and a termination penalty or 47
similar provision that applies if the renewal clause is not 48
exercised is presumed to be a sham transaction. In such a case, 49
the tax shall be calculated and paid on the basis of the entire 50
length of the lease period, including any renewal periods, until 51

S. B. No. 126 Page 3
As Introduced
the termination penalty or similar provision no longer applies. 52
The taxpayer shall bear the burden, by a preponderance of the 53
evidence, that the transaction or series of transactions is not 54
a sham transaction. 55
(3) Except as provided in division (A)(2) of this section, 56
in the case of a sale, the price of which consists in whole or 57
in part of the lease or rental of tangible personal property, 58
the tax shall be measured by the installments of that lease or 59
rental. 60
(4) In the case of a sale of a physical fitness facility 61
service or recreation and sports club service, the price of 62
which consists in whole or in part of a membership for the 63
receipt of the benefit of the service, the tax applicable to the 64
sale shall be measured by the installments thereof. 65
(B) The tax does not apply to the following: 66
(1) Sales to the state or any of its political 67
subdivisions, or to any other state or its political 68
subdivisions if the laws of that state exempt from taxation 69
sales made to this state and its political subdivisions 70

of, such tangible personal property for use by the state or any 79
of its political subdivisions, including for use by the general 80

(5) The furnishing, preparing, or serving of meals without 99

work done; 102
(6)(a) Sales of motor fuel upon receipt, use, 103
distribution, or sale of which in this state a tax is imposed by 104
the law of this state, but this exemption shall not apply to the 105
sale of motor fuel on which a refund of the tax is allowable 106
under division (A) of section 5735.14 of the Revised Code; and 107
