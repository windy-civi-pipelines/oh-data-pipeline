for residential customers and small commercial customers as 38
described by this section. 39
(C)(1) Each demand response program under this section 40
shall be evaluated by the public utilities commission to 41
determine if the program is cost-effective for customers. To 42

commission shall consider all of the following: 44
(a) The need for demand reduction based on capacity 45
prices; 46

(D) An electric distribution utility may enter into an 53
agreement with a residential customer or small commercial 54
customer for the customer to participate in the utility's demand 55
response program. 56

utility may take actions to reduce the customer's load at peak 58
times, such as increasing the temperature on the customer's air 59
conditioner, reducing the temperature on the customer's hot 60
water heater, or cycling other appliances. 61
(F) A customer that participates in the program may 62
override the utility's action to reduce the customer's load for 63
any individual event. 64

future participation in the utility's demand response program if 66
the customer overrides the utility's action pursuant to division 67
(F) of this section. 68

provider may bid the demand response reductions from the 73
utility's demand response program into the capacity market of 74
the regional transmission organization approved by the federal 75
energy regulatory commission and having the responsibility for 76
maintaining reliability in all or part of this state. 77

(K) The commission may approve a performance incentive for 81
a utility with a voluntary demand response program based on 82
savings the program generates. 83
(L) Not more than three years after the effective date of 84
this section, the commission shall evaluate the success of the 85
utility demand response programs and make recommendations to the 86
legislature regarding bidding demand response into the capacity 87
market under division (I) of this section and any other 88
modifications to the programs that will enhance customer 89
benefits. 90
