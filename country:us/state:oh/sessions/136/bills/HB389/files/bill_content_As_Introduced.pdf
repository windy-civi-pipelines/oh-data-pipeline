the registrar of the amounts so deposited, together with any 676
other information, some of which may be prescribed by the 677

transmittal of fees and for safeguarding the interests of the 685
state and of counties, townships, municipal corporations, and 686
transportation improvement districts levying local motor vehicle 687
