section applies only to the taxable year for which the election 525
is made by the pass-through entity. Unless the tax commissioner 526
provides otherwise, this election, once made, is binding and 527
irrevocable for the taxable year for which the election is made. 528
Nothing in this division shall be construed to provide for any 529
deduction or credit that would not be allowable if a nonresident 530
pass-through entity investor were to file an annual return. 531
(4) If a pass-through entity makes the election provided 532
for under division (D) of this section, the pass-through entity 533
shall be liable for any additional taxes, interest, interest 534
penalty, or penalties imposed by this chapter if the tax 535
commissioner finds that the single return does not reflect the 536
correct tax due by the pass-through entity investors covered by 537
that return. Nothing in this division shall be construed to 538
limit or alter the liability, if any, imposed on pass-through 539
entity investors for unpaid or underpaid taxes, interest, 540
interest penalty, or penalties as a result of the pass-through 541

entity's making the election provided for under division (D) of 542

pass-through entity had the single return been filed in a manner 545
reflecting the commissioner's findings. Nothing in division (D) 546
of this section shall be construed to make or hold a pass- 547
through entity liable for tax attributable to a pass-through 548
entity investor's income from a source other than the pass- 549

(E) If a husband and wife file a joint federal income tax 551
return for a taxable year, they shall file a joint return under 552
this section for that taxable year, and their liabilities are 553
joint and several, but, if the federal income tax liability of 554
either spouse is determined on a separate federal income tax 555
return, they shall file separate returns under this section. 556
If either spouse is not required to file a federal income 557
tax return and either or both are required to file a return 558
pursuant to this chapter, they may elect to file separate or 559
joint returns, and, pursuant to that election, their liabilities 560
are separate or joint and several. If a husband and wife file 561
separate returns pursuant to this chapter, each must claim the 562
taxpayer's own exemption, but not both, as authorized under 563

Section 29:
section 5747.02 of the Revised Code on the taxpayer's own 564
return. 565
(F) Each return or notice required to be filed under this 566

Section 30:

taxpayer's duly authorized agent and of the person who prepared 568

social security number. Each return shall be verified by a 570

each year, on forms that the tax commissioner shall prescribe, 577
together with remittance made payable to the treasurer of state 578
in the combined amount of the state and all school district 579
income taxes shown to be due on the form. 580
Upon good cause shown, the commissioner may extend the 581
period for filing any notice or return required to be filed 582
under this section and may adopt rules relating to extensions. 583
If the extension results in an extension of time for the payment 584
of any state or school district income tax liability with 585
respect to which the return is filed, the taxpayer shall pay at 586
the time the tax liability is paid an amount of interest 587
computed at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of 588
the Revised Code on that liability from the time that payment is 589
due without extension to the time of actual payment. Except as 590
provided in section 5747.132 of the Revised Code, in addition to 591
all other interest charges and penalties, all taxes imposed 592
under this chapter or Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code and 593
remaining unpaid after they become due, except combined amounts 594
due of one dollar or less, bear interest at the rate per annum 595
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code until paid or 596
until the day an assessment is issued under section 5747.13 of 597
the Revised Code, whichever occurs first. 598

(I) If a pass-through entity elects to file a single 618
return under division (D) of this section and if any investor is 619
required to file the annual return and make the payment of taxes 620
required by this chapter on account of the investor's other 621
income that is not included in a single return filed by a pass- 622
through entity or any other investor elects to file the annual 623
return, the investor is entitled to a refundable credit equal to 624
the investor's proportionate share of the tax paid by the pass- 625
through entity on behalf of the investor. The investor shall 626
claim the credit for the investor's taxable year in which or 627
with which ends the taxable year of the pass-through entity. 628
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow any credit 629
provided in this chapter to be claimed more than once. For the 630
purpose of computing any interest, penalty, or interest penalty, 631

the investor shall be deemed to have paid the refundable credit 632
provided by this division on the day that the pass-through 633
entity paid the estimated tax or the tax giving rise to the 634
credit. 635
(J) The tax commissioner shall ensure that each return 636
required to be filed under this section includes a box that the 637
taxpayer may check to authorize a paid tax preparer who prepared 638
the return to communicate with the department of taxation about 639
matters pertaining to the return. The return or instructions 640
accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box 641
the taxpayer authorizes the department of taxation to contact 642
the preparer concerning questions that arise during the 643
processing of the return and authorizes the preparer only to 644
provide the department with information that is missing from the 645
return, to contact the department for information about the 646
processing of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund 647
or payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical 648
errors, offsets, or return preparation that the taxpayer has 649
received from the department and has shown to the preparer. 650
(K) The tax commissioner shall permit individual taxpayers 651
to instruct the department of taxation to cause any refund of 652
overpaid taxes to be deposited directly into a checking account, 653
savings account, or an individual retirement account or 654
individual retirement annuity, or preexisting college savings 655
plan or program account offered by the Ohio tuition trust 656
authority under Chapter 3334. of the Revised Code, as designated 657
by the taxpayer, when the taxpayer files the annual return 658
required by this section electronically. 659

(D) and (E) of this section, shall be known as the "relative 1335
need" of the subdivision, for the purposes of this section. 1336
(G) The budget commission shall total the relative need of 1337
all participating subdivisions in the county, and shall compute 1338
a relative need factor by dividing the total estimate of the 1339
undivided local government fund by the total relative need of 1340

(H) The relative need of each subdivision shall be 1342
multiplied by the relative need factor to determine the 1343
proportionate share of the subdivision in the undivided local 1344
government fund of the county; provided, that the maximum 1345
proportionate share of a county shall not exceed the following 1346
maximum percentages of the total estimate of the undivided local 1347
government fund governed by the relationship of the percentage 1348
of the population of the county that resides within municipal 1349
corporations within the county to the total population of the 1350
county as reported in the reports on population in Ohio by the 1351
department of development as of the twentieth day of July of the 1352

D Eighty-one per cent or more Thirty per cent
Where the proportionate share of the county exceeds the 1356

shall adjust the proportionate shares determined pursuant to 1358
this division so that the proportionate share of the county does 1359
not exceed these limitations, and it shall increase the 1360
proportionate shares of all other subdivisions on a pro rata 1361
basis. In counties having a population of less than one hundred 1362

(H) of this section for any calendar year shall not be less than 1367
the product of the average of the percentages of the undivided 1368
local government fund of the county as apportioned to that 1369
subdivision for the calendar years 1968, 1969, and 1970, 1370
multiplied by the total amount of the undivided local government 1371
fund of the county apportioned pursuant to former section 1372

Section 64:
5739.23 of the Revised Code for the calendar year 1970. For the 1373
purposes of this division, the total apportioned amount for the 1374
calendar year 1970 shall be the amount actually allocated to the 1375
county in 1970 from the state collected intangible tax as levied 1376
by section 5707.03 of the Revised Code and distributed pursuant 1377
to section 5725.24 of the Revised Code, plus the amount received 1378
by the county in the calendar year 1970 pursuant to division (B) 1379
(1) of former section 5739.21 of the Revised Code, and 1380
distributed pursuant to former section 5739.22 of the Revised 1381
Code. If the total amount of the undivided local government fund 1382
for any calendar year is less than the amount of the undivided 1383
local government fund apportioned pursuant to former section 1384

Section 65:
5739.23 of the Revised Code for the calendar year 1970, the 1385
minimum amount guaranteed to each subdivision for that calendar 1386
year pursuant to this division shall be reduced on a basis 1387
proportionate to the amount by which the amount of the undivided 1388
local government fund for that calendar year is less than the 1389
amount of the undivided local government fund apportioned for 1390
the calendar year 1970. 1391
(J) On the basis of such apportionment, the county auditor 1392
shall compute the percentage share of each such subdivision in 1393

undivided local government fund, except in accordance with such 1397
percentage shares. 1398
Within ten days after the budget commission has made its 1399
apportionment, whether conducted pursuant to section 5747.51 or 1400

Section 66:
5747.53 of the Revised Code, the auditor shall publish a list of 1401
the subdivisions and the amount each is to receive from the 1402
undivided local government fund and the percentage share of each 1403
subdivision, in a newspaper or newspapers of countywide 1404
circulation, and send a copy of such allocation to the tax 1405
commissioner. 1406
The county auditor shall also send a copy of such 1407
allocation by ordinary or electronic mail to the fiscal officer 1408
of each subdivision entitled to participate in the allocation of 1409
the undivided local government fund of the county. This copy 1410

All money received into the treasury of a subdivision from 1413
the undivided local government fund in a county treasury shall 1414

trustees so requests the legislative authority of the municipal 1419
corporation, shall participate in the money apportioned to such 1420
municipal corporation from the total local government fund, 1421

before January 1, 1998, adopted an alternative method of 1439
apportionment that was approved by the legislative authority of 1440
the city, located partially in the county, with the greatest 1441
population but not the greatest population residing in the 1442
county, "city, located wholly or partially in the county, with 1443
the greatest population" means the city, located wholly or 1444
partially in the county, with the greatest population whether 1445
residing in the county or not, if this alternative meaning is 1446
adopted by action of the board of county commissioners and a 1447

budget commission at a public hearing held at least once in the 1489
year following the effective date of this amendment October 3, 1490
2023, and in every fifth year thereafter. The county budget 1491
commission shall provide reasonable advance notice of the 1492
hearing to all political subdivisions eligible to participate in 1493
the fund and shall take public testimony from any such political 1494
subdivision that wishes to testify. 1495

(3) The election provided for under division (D) of this 524
section applies only to the taxable year for which the election 525
is made by the pass-through entity. Unless the tax commissioner 526
provides otherwise, this election, once made, is binding and 527
irrevocable for the taxable year for which the election is made. 528
Nothing in this division shall be construed to provide for any 529
deduction or credit that would not be allowable if a nonresident 530
pass-through entity investor were to file an annual return. 531
(4) If a pass-through entity makes the election provided 532
for under division (D) of this section, the pass-through entity 533
shall be liable for any additional taxes, interest, interest 534
penalty, or penalties imposed by this chapter if the tax 535
commissioner finds that the single return does not reflect the 536
correct tax due by the pass-through entity investors covered by 537
that return. Nothing in this division shall be construed to 538
limit or alter the liability, if any, imposed on pass-through 539
entity investors for unpaid or underpaid taxes, interest, 540
interest penalty, or penalties as a result of the pass-through 541

entity's making the election provided for under division (D) of 542
this section. For the purposes of division (D) of this section, 543
"correct tax due" means the tax that would have been paid by the 544
pass-through entity had the single return been filed in a manner 545
reflecting the commissioner's findings. Nothing in division (D) 546
of this section shall be construed to make or hold a pass- 547
through entity liable for tax attributable to a pass-through 548
entity investor's income from a source other than the pass- 549

(E) If a husband and wife file a joint federal income tax 551
return for a taxable year, they shall file a joint return under 552
this section for that taxable year, and their liabilities are 553
joint and several, but, if the federal income tax liability of 554
either spouse is determined on a separate federal income tax 555
return, they shall file separate returns under this section. 556
If either spouse is not required to file a federal income 557
tax return and either or both are required to file a return 558
pursuant to this chapter, they may elect to file separate or 559
joint returns, and, pursuant to that election, their liabilities 560
are separate or joint and several. If a husband and wife file 561
separate returns pursuant to this chapter, each must claim the 562
taxpayer's own exemption, but not both, as authorized under 563
section 5747.02 of the Revised Code on the taxpayer's own 564
return. 565
(F) Each return or notice required to be filed under this 566
section shall contain the signature of the taxpayer or the 567
taxpayer's duly authorized agent and of the person who prepared 568
the return for the taxpayer, and shall include the taxpayer's 569
social security number. Each return shall be verified by a 570
declaration under the penalties of perjury. The tax commissioner 571

shall prescribe the form that the signature and declaration 572
shall take. 573
(G) Each return or notice required to be filed under this 574
section shall be made and filed as required by section 5747.04 575
of the Revised Code, on or before the fifteenth day of April of 576
each year, on forms that the tax commissioner shall prescribe, 577
together with remittance made payable to the treasurer of state 578
in the combined amount of the state and all school district 579
income taxes shown to be due on the form. 580
Upon good cause shown, the commissioner may extend the 581
period for filing any notice or return required to be filed 582
under this section and may adopt rules relating to extensions. 583
If the extension results in an extension of time for the payment 584
of any state or school district income tax liability with 585
respect to which the return is filed, the taxpayer shall pay at 586
the time the tax liability is paid an amount of interest 587
computed at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of 588
the Revised Code on that liability from the time that payment is 589
due without extension to the time of actual payment. Except as 590
provided in section 5747.132 of the Revised Code, in addition to 591
all other interest charges and penalties, all taxes imposed 592
under this chapter or Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code and 593
remaining unpaid after they become due, except combined amounts 594
due of one dollar or less, bear interest at the rate per annum 595
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code until paid or 596
until the day an assessment is issued under section 5747.13 of 597
the Revised Code, whichever occurs first. 598

(H) The amounts withheld pursuant to section 5747.06, 607
5747.062, 5747.063, 5747.064, 5747.065, or 5747.071 of the 608
Revised Code shall be allowed to the ultimate recipient of the 609
income as credits against payment of the appropriate taxes 610
imposed on the ultimate recipient by section 5747.02 and under 611
Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code. As used in this division, 612
"ultimate recipient" means the person who is required to report 613
income from which amounts are withheld pursuant to section 614
5747.06, 5747.062, 5747.063, 5747.064, 5747.065, or 5747.071 of 615

this section. 617
(I) If a pass-through entity elects to file a single 618
return under division (D) of this section and if any investor is 619
required to file the annual return and make the payment of taxes 620
required by this chapter on account of the investor's other 621
income that is not included in a single return filed by a pass- 622
through entity or any other investor elects to file the annual 623
return, the investor is entitled to a refundable credit equal to 624
the investor's proportionate share of the tax paid by the pass- 625
through entity on behalf of the investor. The investor shall 626
claim the credit for the investor's taxable year in which or 627
with which ends the taxable year of the pass-through entity. 628
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow any credit 629
provided in this chapter to be claimed more than once. For the 630
purpose of computing any interest, penalty, or interest penalty, 631

H. B. No. 118 Page 23

the investor shall be deemed to have paid the refundable credit 632
provided by this division on the day that the pass-through 633
entity paid the estimated tax or the tax giving rise to the 634
credit. 635
(J) The tax commissioner shall ensure that each return 636
required to be filed under this section includes a box that the 637
taxpayer may check to authorize a paid tax preparer who prepared 638
the return to communicate with the department of taxation about 639
matters pertaining to the return. The return or instructions 640
accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box 641
the taxpayer authorizes the department of taxation to contact 642
the preparer concerning questions that arise during the 643
processing of the return and authorizes the preparer only to 644
provide the department with information that is missing from the 645
return, to contact the department for information about the 646
processing of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund 647
or payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical 648
errors, offsets, or return preparation that the taxpayer has 649

credited to the account of each such transportation district 1113
shall be prorated on the basis of the number of centerline miles 1114
of public roads and highways in both the local authority and the 1115
respective districts. Amounts credited to a transportation 1116

(B)(1) On or before the tenth day of each month that 1136
begins after the effective date of this section, the tax 1137
commissioner shall compute a lead certification delay adjustment 1138
for each local authority to which both of the following apply on 1139
or after that effective date: 1140

Sec. 5747.51. (A) On or before the twenty-fifth day of 1222
July of each year, the tax commissioner shall make and certify 1223
to the county auditor of each county an estimate of the amount 1224
of the local government fund to be allocated to the undivided 1225
local government fund of each county for the ensuing calendar 1226
year, adjusting the total as required to account for 1227
subdivisions receiving local government funds under section 1228
5747.502 of the Revised Code. 1229
(B) At each annual regular session of the county budget 1230
commission convened pursuant to section 5705.27 of the Revised 1231
Code, each auditor shall present to the commission the 1232
certificate of the commissioner, the annual tax budget and 1233
estimates, and the records showing the action of the commission 1234
in its last preceding regular session. The commission, after 1235
extending to the representatives of each subdivision an 1236
opportunity to be heard, under oath administered by any member 1237
of the commission, and considering all the facts and information 1238
presented to it by the auditor, shall determine the amount of 1239
the undivided local government fund needed by and to be 1240
apportioned to each subdivision for current operating expenses, 1241
as shown in the tax budget of the subdivision. This 1242
determination shall be made pursuant to divisions (C) to (I) of 1243
this section, unless the commission has provided for a formula 1244
pursuant to section 5747.53 of the Revised Code. The 1245
commissioner shall reduce the amount of funds from the undivided 1246
local government fund to a subdivision required to receive 1247
reduced funds under section 5747.502 or 5747.504 of the Revised 1248

Nothing in this section prevents the budget commission, 1250
for the purpose of apportioning the undivided local government 1251
fund, from inquiring into the claimed needs of any subdivision 1252

H. B. No. 118 Page 44

as stated in its tax budget, or from adjusting claimed needs to 1253
reflect actual needs. For the purposes of this section, "current 1254
operating expenses" means the lawful expenditures of a 1255
subdivision, except those for permanent improvements and except 1256
payments for interest, sinking fund, and retirement of bonds, 1257
notes, and certificates of indebtedness of the subdivision. 1258
(C) The commission shall determine the combined total of 1259
the estimated expenditures, including transfers, from the 1260
general fund and any special funds other than special funds 1261
established for road and bridge; street construction, 1262
maintenance, and repair; state highway improvement; and gas, 1263
water, sewer, and electric public utilities operated by a 1264
subdivision, as shown in the subdivision's tax budget for the 1265
ensuing calendar year. 1266
(D) From the combined total of expenditures calculated 1267
pursuant to division (C) of this section, the commission shall 1268
deduct the following expenditures, if included in these funds in 1269
the tax budget: 1270
(1) Expenditures for permanent improvements as defined in 1271
division (E) of section 5705.01 of the Revised Code; 1272
(2) In the case of counties and townships, transfers to 1273
the road and bridge fund, and in the case of municipalities, 1274
transfers to the street construction, maintenance, and repair 1275
fund and the state highway improvement fund; 1276
(3) Expenditures for the payment of debt charges; 1277
(4) Expenditures for the payment of judgments. 1278

section from the following sources shall be deducted from the 1282
combined total of expenditures calculated pursuant to division 1283
(C) of this section: 1284
(1) Taxes levied within the ten-mill limitation, as 1285
defined in section 5705.02 of the Revised Code; 1286
(2) The budget commission allocation of estimated county 1287
public library fund revenues to be distributed pursuant to 1288
section 5747.48 of the Revised Code; 1289
(3) Estimated unencumbered balances as shown on the tax 1290
budget as of the thirty-first day of December of the current 1291
year in the general fund, but not any estimated balance in any 1292
special fund considered in division (C) of this section; 1293
(4) Revenue, including transfers, shown in the general 1294
fund and any special funds other than special funds established 1295
for road and bridge; street construction, maintenance, and 1296
repair; state highway improvement; and gas, water, sewer, and 1297
electric public utilities, from all other sources except those 1298
that a subdivision receives from an additional tax or service 1299
charge voted by its electorate or receives from special 1300
assessment or revenue bond collection. For the purposes of this 1301
division, where the charter of a municipal corporation prohibits 1302
the levy of an income tax, an income tax levied by the 1303
legislative authority of such municipal corporation pursuant to 1304
an amendment of the charter of that municipal corporation to 1305
authorize such a levy represents an additional tax voted by the 1306
electorate of that municipal corporation. For the purposes of 1307
this division, any measure adopted by a board of county 1308
commissioners pursuant to section 322.02, 4504.02, or 5739.021 1309
of the Revised Code, including those measures upheld by the 1310
electorate in a referendum conducted pursuant to section 1311

322.021, 4504.021, or 5739.022 of the Revised Code, shall not be 1312
considered an additional tax voted by the electorate. 1313
Subject to division (F) of section 5705.29 of the Revised 1314
Code, money in a reserve balance account established by a 1315
county, township, or municipal corporation under section 5705.13 1316
of the Revised Code shall not be considered an unencumbered 1317
balance or revenue under division (E)(3) or (4) of this section. 1318
Money in a reserve balance account established by a township 1319
under section 5705.132 of the Revised Code shall not be 1320
considered an unencumbered balance or revenue under division (E) 1321
(3) or (4) of this section. 1322
If a county, township, or municipal corporation has 1323
created and maintains a nonexpendable trust fund under section 1324
5705.131 of the Revised Code, the principal of the fund, and any 1325
additions to the principal arising from sources other than the 1326
reinvestment of investment earnings arising from such a fund, 1327
shall not be considered an unencumbered balance or revenue under 1328
division (E)(3) or (4) of this section. Only investment earnings 1329
arising from investment of the principal or investment of such 1330
additions to principal may be considered an unencumbered balance 1331
or revenue under those divisions. 1332
(F) The total expenditures calculated pursuant to division 1333
(C) of this section, less the deductions authorized in divisions 1334
(D) and (E) of this section, shall be known as the "relative 1335
need" of the subdivision, for the purposes of this section. 1336
(G) The budget commission shall total the relative need of 1337
all participating subdivisions in the county, and shall compute 1338
a relative need factor by dividing the total estimate of the 1339
undivided local government fund by the total relative need of 1340
all participating subdivisions. 1341

H. B. No. 118 Page 47

(H) The relative need of each subdivision shall be 1342
multiplied by the relative need factor to determine the 1343
proportionate share of the subdivision in the undivided local 1344
government fund of the county; provided, that the maximum 1345
proportionate share of a county shall not exceed the following 1346
maximum percentages of the total estimate of the undivided local 1347
government fund governed by the relationship of the percentage 1348
of the population of the county that resides within municipal 1349
corporations within the county to the total population of the 1350
county as reported in the reports on population in Ohio by the 1351
department of development as of the twentieth day of July of the 1352
year in which the tax budget is filed with the budget 1353
commission: 1354

A Percentage of municipal population Percentage share of the county
within the county: shall not exceed:
B Less than forty-one per cent Sixty per cent
C Forty-one per cent or more but less Fifty per cent
than eighty-one per cent
D Eighty-one per cent or more Thirty per cent
Where the proportionate share of the county exceeds the 1356
limitations established in this division, the budget commission 1357
shall adjust the proportionate shares determined pursuant to 1358
this division so that the proportionate share of the county does 1359
not exceed these limitations, and it shall increase the 1360
proportionate shares of all other subdivisions on a pro rata 1361
basis. In counties having a population of less than one hundred 1362

H. B. No. 118 Page 48
As Introduced
thousand, not less than ten per cent shall be distributed to the 1363
townships therein. 1364
(I) The proportionate share of each subdivision in the 1365
undivided local government fund determined pursuant to division 1366
(H) of this section for any calendar year shall not be less than 1367
the product of the average of the percentages of the undivided 1368
local government fund of the county as apportioned to that 1369
subdivision for the calendar years 1968, 1969, and 1970, 1370
multiplied by the total amount of the undivided local government 1371
fund of the county apportioned pursuant to former section 1372
5739.23 of the Revised Code for the calendar year 1970. For the 1373
purposes of this division, the total apportioned amount for the 1374
calendar year 1970 shall be the amount actually allocated to the 1375
county in 1970 from the state collected intangible tax as levied 1376
by section 5707.03 of the Revised Code and distributed pursuant 1377
to section 5725.24 of the Revised Code, plus the amount received 1378
by the county in the calendar year 1970 pursuant to division (B) 1379
(1) of former section 5739.21 of the Revised Code, and 1380
distributed pursuant to former section 5739.22 of the Revised 1381
Code. If the total amount of the undivided local government fund 1382
for any calendar year is less than the amount of the undivided 1383
local government fund apportioned pursuant to former section 1384
5739.23 of the Revised Code for the calendar year 1970, the 1385
minimum amount guaranteed to each subdivision for that calendar 1386
year pursuant to this division shall be reduced on a basis 1387
proportionate to the amount by which the amount of the undivided 1388
local government fund for that calendar year is less than the 1389
amount of the undivided local government fund apportioned for 1390
the calendar year 1970. 1391
(J) On the basis of such apportionment, the county auditor 1392
shall compute the percentage share of each such subdivision in 1393

H. B. No. 118 Page 49

the undivided local government fund and shall at the same time 1394
certify to the tax commissioner the percentage share of the 1395
county as a subdivision. No payment shall be made from the 1396
undivided local government fund, except in accordance with such 1397
percentage shares. 1398
Within ten days after the budget commission has made its 1399
apportionment, whether conducted pursuant to section 5747.51 or 1400
5747.53 of the Revised Code, the auditor shall publish a list of 1401
the subdivisions and the amount each is to receive from the 1402
undivided local government fund and the percentage share of each 1403
subdivision, in a newspaper or newspapers of countywide 1404
circulation, and send a copy of such allocation to the tax 1405
commissioner. 1406
The county auditor shall also send a copy of such 1407
allocation by ordinary or electronic mail to the fiscal officer 1408
of each subdivision entitled to participate in the allocation of 1409
the undivided local government fund of the county. This copy 1410
shall constitute the official notice of the commission action 1411
referred to in section 5705.37 of the Revised Code. 1412
All money received into the treasury of a subdivision from 1413
the undivided local government fund in a county treasury shall 1414
be paid into the general fund and used for the current operating 1415
expenses of the subdivision. 1416
If a municipal corporation maintains a municipal 1417
university, such municipal university, when the board of 1418
trustees so requests the legislative authority of the municipal 1419
corporation, shall participate in the money apportioned to such 1420
municipal corporation from the total local government fund, 1421
however created and constituted, in such amount as requested by 1422
the board of trustees, provided such sum does not exceed nine 1423

per cent of the total amount paid to the municipal corporation. 1424
If any public official fails to maintain the records 1425
required by sections 5747.50 to 5747.55 of the Revised Code or 1426
by the rules issued by the tax commissioner, the auditor of 1427
state, or the treasurer of state pursuant to such sections, or 1428
fails to comply with any law relating to the enforcement of such 1429
sections, the local government fund money allocated to the 1430
county may be withheld until such time as the public official 1431
has complied with such sections or such law or the rules issued 1432
pursuant thereto. 1433
Sec. 5747.53. (A) As used in this section: 1434
(1) "City, located wholly or partially in the county, with 1435
the greatest population" means the city, located wholly or 1436
partially in the county, with the greatest population residing 1437
in the county; however, if the county budget commission on or 1438
before January 1, 1998, adopted an alternative method of 1439
apportionment that was approved by the legislative authority of 1440
the city, located partially in the county, with the greatest 1441
population but not the greatest population residing in the 1442
county, "city, located wholly or partially in the county, with 1443
the greatest population" means the city, located wholly or 1444
partially in the county, with the greatest population whether 1445
residing in the county or not, if this alternative meaning is 1446
adopted by action of the board of county commissioners and a 1447
majority of the boards of township trustees and legislative 1448
authorities of municipal corporations located wholly or 1449
partially in the county. 1450
(2) "Participating political subdivision" means a 1451

apportionment in the current calendar year. 1459
(B) In lieu of the method of apportionment of the 1460
undivided local government fund of the county provided by 1461
section 5747.51 of the Revised Code, the county budget 1462
commission may provide for the apportionment of the fund under 1463
an alternative method or on a formula basis as authorized by 1464
this section. The commissioner shall reduce the amount of funds 1465
from the undivided local government fund to a subdivision 1466
required to receive reduced funds under section 5747.502 or 1467
5747.504 of the Revised Code. 1468
Except as otherwise provided in division (C) of this 1469
section, the alternative method of apportionment shall have 1470
first been approved by all of the following governmental units: 1471
the board of county commissioners; the legislative authority of 1472
the city, located wholly or partially in the county, with the 1473
greatest population; and a majority of the boards of township 1474
trustees and legislative authorities of municipal corporations, 1475
located wholly or partially in the county, excluding the 1476
legislative authority of the city, located wholly or partially 1477
in the county, with the greatest population. In granting or 1478
denying approval for an alternative method of apportionment, the 1479
board of county commissioners, boards of township trustees, and 1480
legislative authorities of municipal corporations shall act by 1481
motion. A motion to approve shall be passed upon a majority vote 1482
of the members of a board of county commissioners, board of 1483

township trustees, or legislative authority of a municipal 1484
corporation, shall take effect immediately, and need not be 1485
published. 1486
Any alternative method of apportionment adopted and 1487
approved under this division shall be reviewed by the county 1488
budget commission at a public hearing held at least once in the 1489
year following the effective date of this amendment October 3, 1490
2023, and in every fifth year thereafter. The county budget 1491
commission shall provide reasonable advance notice of the 1492
hearing to all political subdivisions eligible to participate in 1493
the fund and shall take public testimony from any such political 1494
subdivision that wishes to testify. 1495
Any alternative method of apportionment adopted and 1496
approved under this division may be revised, amended, or 1497
repealed in the same manner as it may be adopted and approved. 1498
If an alternative method of apportionment adopted and approved 1499
under this division is repealed, the undivided local government 1500
fund of the county shall be apportioned among the subdivisions 1501
eligible to participate in the fund, commencing in the ensuing 1502
calendar year, under the apportionment provided in section 1503
5747.52 of the Revised Code, unless the repeal occurs by 1504
operation of division (C) of this section or a new method for 1505
apportionment of the fund is provided in the action of repeal. 1506
(C) This division applies only in counties in which the 1507
city, located wholly or partially in the county, with the 1508
greatest population has a population of twenty thousand or less 1509
and a population that is less than fifteen per cent of the total 1510
population of the county. In such a county, the legislative 1511

undivided local government fund to each subdivision eligible to 1559
participate in the fund, and the auditor, when the amount of 1560
those shares is in the custody of the treasurer in the amounts 1561
so computed to be due the respective subdivisions, shall at the 1562
same time certify to the tax commissioner the percentage share 1563
of the county as a subdivision. All money received into the 1564
treasury of a subdivision from the undivided local government 1565
fund in a county treasury shall be paid into the general fund 1566

legislative authority of the municipal corporation, shall 1570
participate in the money apportioned to the municipal 1571
corporation from the total local government fund, however 1572
created and constituted, in the amount requested by the board of 1573

presented in this act as a composite of the section as amended 1686
by H.B. 33 of the 135th General Assembly and H.B. 62 of the 1687

principle stated in division (B) of section 1.52 of the Revised 1689
Code that amendments are to be harmonized if reasonably capable 1690
of simultaneous operation, finds that the composite is the 1691
resulting version of the section in effect prior to the 1692
effective date of the section as presented in this act. 1693
