As Introduced
(2) Taxes levied within the one per cent limitation 20
imposed by Section 2 of Article XII, Ohio Constitution; 21
(3) Taxes provided for by the charter of a municipal 22
corporation. 23
(B) As used in this section: 24
(1) "Real property" includes real property owned by a 25
railroad. 26
(2) "Carryover property" means all real property on the 27
current year's tax list except: 28
(a) Land and improvements that were not taxed by the 29
district in both the preceding year and the current year; 30
(b) Land and improvements that were not in the same class 31
in both the preceding year and the current year. 32
(3) "Effective tax rate" means with respect to each class 33
of property: 34
(a) The sum of the total taxes that would have been 35
charged and payable for current expenses against real property 36
in that class if each of the district's taxes were reduced for 37
the current year under division (D)(1) of this section without 38
regard to the application of division (E)(3) of this section 39
divided by 40
(b) The taxable value of all real property in that class. 41
(4) "Taxes charged and payable" means the taxes charged 42
and payable prior to any reduction required by section 319.302 43
or, if applicable, 319.303 of the Revised Code. 44
(C) The tax commissioner shall make the determinations 45
required by this section each year, without regard to whether a 46

H. B. No. 186 Page 3
As Introduced
taxing district has territory in a county to which section 47
5715.24 of the Revised Code applies for that year. Separate 48
determinations shall be made for each of the two classes 49
established pursuant to section 5713.041 of the Revised Code. 50
(D) With respect to each tax authorized to be levied by 51
each taxing district, the tax commissioner, annually, shall do 52
both of the following: 53
(1) Determine by what percentage, if any, the sums levied 54
by such tax against the carryover property in each class would 55
have to be reduced for the tax to levy the same number of 56
dollars against such property in that class in the current year 57
as were charged against such property by such tax in the 58
preceding year subsequent to the reduction made under this 59
section but before the reduction made under section 319.302 of 60
the Revised Code. In the case of a tax levied for the first time 61
that is not a renewal of an existing tax, the commissioner shall 62
determine by what percentage the sums that would otherwise be 63
levied by such tax against carryover property in each class 64
would have to be reduced to equal the amount that would have 65
been levied if the full rate thereof had been imposed against 66
the total taxable value of such property in the preceding tax 67
year. A tax or portion of a tax that is designated a replacement 68
levy under section 5705.192 of the Revised Code is not a renewal 69
of an existing tax for purposes of this division. 70
(2) Certify each percentage determined in division (D)(1) 71
of this section, as adjusted under division (E) of this section, 72
and the class of property to which that percentage applies to 73
the auditor of each county in which the district has territory. 74
The auditor, after complying with section 319.30 of the Revised 75
Code, shall reduce the sum to be levied by such tax against each 76

H. B. No. 186 Page 4
As Introduced
parcel of real property in the district by the percentage so 77
certified for its class. Certification shall be made by the 78
first day of September except in the case of a tax levied for 79
the first time, in which case certification shall be made within 80
fifteen days of the date the county auditor submits the 81
information necessary to make the required determination. 82
(E)(1) As used in division (E)(2) of this section, "pre- 83
1982 joint vocational taxes" means, with respect to a class of 84
property, the difference between the following amounts: 85
(a) The taxes charged and payable in tax year 1981 against 86
the property in that class for the current expenses of the joint 87
vocational school district of which the school district is a 88
part after making all reductions under this section; 89
(b) Two-tenths of one per cent of the taxable value of all 90
real property in that class. 91
If the amount in division (E)(1)(b) of this section 92
exceeds the amount in division (E)(1)(a) of this section, the 93
pre-1982 joint vocational taxes shall be zero. 94
As used in divisions (E)(2) and (3) of this section, 95
"taxes charged and payable" has the same meaning as in division 96
(B)(4) of this section and excludes any tax charged and payable 97
in 1985 or thereafter under sections 5705.194 to 5705.197 or 98
section 5705.199, 5705.213, 5705.219, or 5748.09 of the Revised 99
Code. 100
(2) If in the case of a school district other than a joint 101
vocational or cooperative education school district any 102
percentage required to be used in division (D)(2) of this 103
section for either class of property could cause the total taxes 104
charged and payable for current expenses to be less than two per 105

H. B. No. 186 Page 5
As Introduced
cent of the taxable value of all real property in that class 106
that is subject to taxation by the district, the commissioner 107
shall determine what percentages would cause the district's 108
total taxes charged and payable for current expenses against 109
that class, after all reductions that would otherwise be made 110
under this section, to equal, when combined with the pre-1982 111
joint vocational taxes against that class, the lesser of the 112
following: 113
(a) The sum of the rates at which those taxes are 114
authorized to be levied; 115
(b) Two per cent of the taxable value of the property in 116
that class. The auditor shall use such percentages in making the 117
reduction required by this section for that class. 118
(3) If in the case of a joint vocational school district 119
any percentage required to be used in division (D)(2) of this 120
section for either class of property could cause the total taxes 121
charged and payable for current expenses for that class to be 122
less than two-tenths of one per cent of the taxable value of 123
that class, the commissioner shall determine what percentages 124
would cause the district's total taxes charged and payable for 125
current expenses for that class, after all reductions that would 126
otherwise be made under this section, to equal that amount. The 127
auditor shall use such percentages in making the reductions 128
required by this section for that class. 129
(F) No reduction shall be made under this section in the 130
rate at which any tax is levied. 131
(G) The commissioner may order a county auditor to furnish 132
any information the commissioner needs to make the 133
determinations required under division (D) or (E) of this 134

H. B. No. 186 Page 6
As Introduced
section, and the auditor shall supply the information in the 135
form and by the date specified in the order. If the auditor 136
fails to comply with an order issued under this division, except 137
for good cause as determined by the commissioner, the 138
commissioner shall withhold from such county or taxing district 139
therein fifty per cent of state revenues to local governments 140
pursuant to section 5747.50 of the Revised Code or shall direct 141
the department of education and workforce to withhold therefrom 142
fifty per cent of state revenues to school districts pursuant to 143
Chapter 3317. of the Revised Code. The commissioner shall 144
withhold the distribution of such revenues until the county 145
auditor has complied with this division, and the department 146
shall withhold the distribution of such revenues until the 147
commissioner has notified the department that the county auditor 148
has complied with this division. 149
(H) If the commissioner is unable to certify a tax 150
reduction factor for either class of property in a taxing 151
district located in more than one county by the last day of 152
November because information required under division (G) of this 153
section is unavailable, the commissioner may compute and certify 154
an estimated tax reduction factor for that district for that 155
class. The estimated factor shall be based upon an estimate of 156
the unavailable information. Upon receipt of the actual 157
information for a taxing district that received an estimated tax 158
reduction factor, the commissioner shall compute the actual tax 159
reduction factor and use that factor to compute the taxes that 160
should have been charged and payable against each parcel of 161
property for the year for which the estimated reduction factor 162
was used. The amount by which the estimated factor resulted in 163
an overpayment or underpayment in taxes on any parcel shall be 164
added to or subtracted from the amount due on that parcel in the 165

H. B. No. 186 Page 7
As Introduced
ensuing tax year. 166
A percentage or a tax reduction factor determined or 167
computed by the commissioner under this section shall be used 168
solely for the purpose of reducing the sums to be levied by the 169
tax to which it applies for the year for which it was determined 170
or computed. It shall not be used in making any tax computations 171
for any ensuing tax year. 172
(I) In making the determinations under division (D)(1) of 173
this section, the tax commissioner shall take account of changes 174
in the taxable value of carryover property resulting from 175
complaints filed under section 5715.19 of the Revised Code for 176
determinations made for the tax year in which such changes are 177
reported to the commissioner. Such changes shall be reported to 178
the commissioner on the first abstract of real property filed 179
with the commissioner under section 5715.23 of the Revised Code 180
following the date on which the complaint is finally determined 181
by the board of revision or by a court or other authority with 182
jurisdiction on appeal. The tax commissioner shall account for 183
such changes in making the determinations only for the tax year 184
in which the change in valuation is reported. Such a valuation 185
change shall not be used to recompute the percentages determined 186
under division (D)(1) of this section for any prior tax year. 187

for the reduction has been approved. The amount of the reduction 526
shall equal two and one-half per cent of the amount of taxes to 527
be levied by qualifying levies on the homestead or the 528
manufactured or mobile home after applying section 319.301 of 529
the Revised Code. For the purposes of this division, "qualifying 530
levy" has the same meaning as in section 319.302 of the Revised 531
Code. 532
(C) The reductions granted by this section do not apply to 533
special assessments or respread of assessments levied against 534
the homestead, and if there is a transfer of ownership 535
subsequent to the filing of an application for a reduction in 536
taxes, such reductions are not forfeited for such year by virtue 537
of such transfer. 538
(D) The reductions in taxable value referred to in this 539
section shall be applied solely as a factor for the purpose of 540
computing the reduction of taxes under this section and shall 541

reduction of taxes provided for in sections 323.151 to 323.159 551
of the Revised Code shall be proportionately adjusted to the 552
extent necessary to provide such funds from levies within the 553
ten-mill limitation. 554

of the board of county commissioners levying a sales and use tax 575
under sections 5739.026 and 5741.023 of the Revised Code. 576
(B) On or before December 31, 1996, the board of county 577
commissioners of a qualifying county may adopt a resolution 578
under this section. The resolution shall grant a partial real 579
property tax exemption to each homestead in the county that also 580
receives the tax reduction under division (B) of section 323.152 581
of the Revised Code. The partial exemption shall take the form 582
of the reduction by a specified percentage each year of the real 583
property taxes on the homestead. The resolution shall specify 584
the percentage, which may be any amount. The board may include 585
in the resolution a condition that the partial exemption will 586
apply only upon the receipt by the county of additional revenue 587
from a source specified in the resolution. The resolution shall 588
specify the tax year in which the partial exemption first 589
applies, which may be the tax year in which the resolution takes 590
effect as long as the resolution takes effect before the county 591
auditor certifies the tax duplicate of real and public utility 592
property for that tax year to the county treasurer. Upon 593
adopting the resolution, the board shall certify copies of it to 594
the county auditor and the tax commissioner. 595
(C) After complying with sections 319.301, 319.302, 596

(D) For each tax year, the county auditor shall certify to 604
the board of county commissioners the total amount by which real 605
property taxes were reduced under this section. At the time of 606
each semi-annual settlement of real property taxes between the 607
county auditor and county treasurer, the board of county 608
commissioners shall pay to the auditor one-half of that total 609
amount. Upon receipt of the payment, the county auditor shall 610
distribute it among the various taxing districts in the county 611
as if it had been levied, collected, and settled as real 612
property taxes. The board of county commissioners shall make the 613
payment from the county general fund or from any other county 614
revenue that may be used for that purpose. In making the 615
payment, the board may use revenue from taxes levied by the 616
county to provide additional general revenue under sections 617
5739.021 and 5741.021 of the Revised Code or to provide 618
additional revenue for the county general fund under sections 619
5739.026 and 5741.023 of the Revised Code. 620
(E) The partial exemption under this section shall not 621
directly or indirectly affect the determination of the principal 622
amount of notes that may be issued in anticipation of a tax levy 623
or the amount of securities that may be issued for any permanent 624
improvements authorized in conjunction with a tax levy. 625
(F) At any time, the board of county commissioners may 626
adopt a resolution amending or repealing the partial exemption 627
granted under this section. Upon adopting a resolution amending 628
or repealing the partial exemption, the board shall certify 629
copies of it to the county auditor and the tax commissioner. The 630
resolution shall specify the tax year in which the amendment or 631
repeal first applies, which may be the tax year in which the 632
resolution takes effect as long as the resolution takes effect 633
before the county auditor certifies the tax duplicate of real 634

(H)(2) of section 321.24 of the Revised Code, the county auditor 2081
shall deliver a copy of the delinquent manufactured home tax 2082
list to the county treasurer. The auditor shall update and 2083
publish the delinquent manufactured home tax list annually in 2084
the same manner as delinquent real property tax lists are 2085
published. The county auditor may apportion the cost of 2086
publishing the list among taxing districts in proportion to the 2087
amount of delinquent manufactured home taxes so published that 2088
each taxing district is entitled to receive upon collection of 2089
those taxes, or the county auditor may charge the owner of a 2090
home on the list a flat fee established under section 319.54 of 2091
the Revised Code for the cost of publishing the list and, if the 2092
fee is not paid, may place the fee upon the delinquent 2093
manufactured home tax list as a lien on the listed home, to be 2094

(3) When taxes, penalties, or interest are charged against 2096
a person on the delinquent manufactured home tax list and are 2097
not paid within sixty days after the list is delivered to the 2098
county treasurer, the county treasurer shall, in addition to any 2099
other remedy provided by law for the collection of taxes, 2100
penalties, and interest, enforce collection of such taxes, 2101
penalties, and interest by civil action in the name of the 2102
treasurer against the owner for the recovery of the unpaid taxes 2103
following the procedures for the recovery of delinquent real 2104
property taxes in sections 323.25 to 323.28 of the Revised Code. 2105
The action may be brought in municipal or county court, provided 2106

books of the county treasurer against such person, that they are 2112
due and unpaid, and that such person is indebted in the amount 2113
of taxes appearing to be due the county. The treasurer need not 2114
set forth any other matter relating thereto. If it is found on 2115
the trial of the action that the person is indebted to the 2116
state, judgment shall be rendered in favor of the county 2117
treasurer prosecuting the action. The judgment debtor is not 2118
entitled to the benefit of any law for stay of execution or 2119
exemption of property from levy or sale on execution in the 2120
enforcement of the judgment. 2121
Upon the filing of an entry of confirmation of sale or an 2122
order of forfeiture in a proceeding brought under this division, 2123

title to the purchaser upon presentation of proof of filing of 2126
the entry of confirmation or order and, in the case of a 2127
forfeiture, presentation of the county auditor's certificate of 2128

auditor's service in assessing the taxes; two per cent shall be 2133
allowed as compensation to the county treasurer for the services 2134
the county treasurer renders as a result of the tax levied by 2135
this section. Such amounts shall be paid into the county 2136
treasury, to the credit of the county general revenue fund, on 2137
the warrant of the county auditor. Fees to be paid to the credit 2138
of the real estate assessment fund shall be collected pursuant 2139

The balance of the taxes collected shall be distributed among 2142
the taxing subdivisions of the county in which the taxes are 2143
collected and paid in the same proportions that the amount of 2144
manufactured home tax levied by each taxing subdivision of the 2145
county in the current tax year bears to the amount of such tax 2146
levied by all such subdivisions in the county in the current tax 2147
year. The taxes levied and revenues collected under this section 2148
shall be in lieu of any general property tax and any tax levied 2149
with respect to the privilege of using or occupying a 2150
manufactured or mobile home in this state except as provided in 2151
sections 4503.04 and 5741.02 of the Revised Code. 2152
(J) An agreement to purchase or a bill of sale for a 2153
manufactured home shall show whether or not the furnishings and 2154
equipment are included in the purchase price. 2155
(K) If the county treasurer and the county prosecuting 2156
attorney agree that an item charged on the delinquent 2157
manufactured home tax list is uncollectible, they shall certify 2158
that determination and the reasons to the county board of 2159
revision. If the board determines the amount is uncollectible, 2160
it shall certify its determination to the county auditor, who 2161
shall strike the item from the list. 2162
(L)(1) The county auditor shall appraise at its true value 2163
any manufactured or mobile home in which ownership is 2164
transferred or which first acquires situs in this state on or 2165
after January 1, 2000, and any manufactured or mobile home the 2166

capacity to function as a residence, any obsolete 2174
characteristics, and other factors that may tend to prove its 2175
true value. 2176

subject of an arm's length sale between a willing seller and a 2178
willing buyer within a reasonable length of time prior to the 2179
determination of true value, the county auditor shall consider 2180
the sale price of the home to be the true value for taxation 2181
purposes. 2182
(b) The sale price in an arm's length transaction between 2183
a willing seller and a willing buyer shall not be considered the 2184
true value of the home if either of the following occurred after 2185
the sale: 2186
(i) The home has lost value due to a casualty. 2187
(ii) An addition or fixture has been added to the home. 2188
(3) The county auditor shall have each home viewed and 2189
appraised at least once in each six-year period in the same year 2190
in which real property in the county is appraised pursuant to 2191
Chapter 5713. of the Revised Code, and shall update the 2192
appraised values in the third calendar year following the 2193
appraisal. The person viewing or appraising a home may enter the 2194
home to determine by actual view any additions or fixtures that 2195
have been added since the last appraisal. In conducting the 2196
appraisals and establishing the true value, the auditor shall 2197
follow the procedures set forth for appraising real property in 2198

home, the auditor shall notify the owner of the home in writing, 2204
delivered by mail or in person. The notice shall be given at 2205

reflects the change. Failure to receive the notice does not 2207
invalidate any proceeding under this section. 2208

March of the current tax year or the date of closing of the 2215
collection for the first half of manufactured home taxes for the 2216
current tax year, whichever is later. The auditor shall present 2217

auditor under this section. The board shall hear and investigate 2219
the complaint and may take action on it as provided under 2220
sections 5715.11 to 5715.19 of the Revised Code. 2221
(c) If the county board of revision determines, pursuant 2222
to a complaint against the valuation of a manufactured or mobile 2223
home filed under this section, that the amount of taxes, 2224
assessments, or other charges paid was in excess of the amount 2225

charge or any part thereof has been erroneously charged as a 2234
result of a clerical error as defined in section 319.35 of the 2235
Revised Code, the county auditor shall call the attention of the 2236
county board of revision to the erroneous charges. If the board 2237
finds that the taxes or other charges have been erroneously 2238
charged or collected, it shall certify the finding to the 2239
auditor. Upon receipt of the certification, the auditor shall 2240
remove the erroneous charges on the manufactured home tax list 2241

4503.0610 of the Revised Code or division (A), (B)(1), or (C) of 2432
this section. The reduction applies to only one manufactured or 2433
mobile home owned and occupied by the surviving spouse of a 2434
disabled veteran. A manufactured or mobile home qualifies for a 2435
reduction in taxes under division (B)(2) of this section 2436
beginning in one of the following tax years: 2437
(a) For a surviving spouse described in division (H)(1) of 2438
section 4503.064 of the Revised Code, the year the disabled 2439
veteran dies; 2440
(b) For a surviving spouse described in division (H)(2) of 2441
section 4503.064 of the Revised Code, the first year on the 2442
first day of January of which the total disability rating 2443
described in division (F) of section 323.151 of the Revised Code 2444
has been received for the deceased spouse. 2445
In either case, the reduction shall continue through the 2446
tax year in which the surviving spouse dies or remarries. 2447
(C) The manufactured home tax levied pursuant to division 2448
(C) of section 4503.06 of the Revised Code on a manufactured or 2449
mobile home that is owned and occupied by the surviving spouse 2450
of a public service officer killed in the line of duty shall be 2451
reduced for any tax year for which an application for such 2452
reduction has been approved, provided the surviving spouse did 2453
not acquire ownership from a person, other than the surviving 2454
spouse's deceased public service officer spouse, related by 2455
consanguinity or affinity for the purpose of qualifying for the 2456
reduction. An owner includes an owner within the meaning of 2457
division (A)(2) of this section. 2458
(1) For manufactured and mobile homes for which the tax 2459
imposed by section 4503.06 of the Revised Code is computed under 2460

H. B. No. 186 Page 87

division (D)(2) of that section, the reduction shall equal the 2461
product obtained by multiplying fifty thousand dollars of the 2462
true value of the property in money, as adjusted under division 2463
(A)(2)(e) of this section, by the amounts described in divisions 2464
(A)(2)(b)(ii) to (iv) of this section. 2465
(2) For manufactured and mobile homes for which the tax 2466
imposed by section 4503.06 of the Revised Code is computed under 2467
division (D)(1) of that section, the reduction shall equal the 2468
product obtained by multiplying fifty thousand dollars of the 2469
cost to the owner, or the market value at the time of purchase, 2470
whichever is greater, as those terms are used in division (D)(1) 2471
of section 4503.06 of the Revised Code, as adjusted under 2472
division (A)(2)(e) of this section, by the amounts described in 2473
divisions (A)(2)(d)(ii) to (iv) of this section. 2474
The reduction is in lieu of any reduction under section 2475
4503.0610 of the Revised Code or division (A) or (B) of this 2476
section. The reduction applies to only one manufactured or 2477
mobile home owned and occupied by such a surviving spouse. A 2478
manufactured or mobile home qualifies for a reduction in taxes 2479
under this division for the tax year in which the public service 2480
officer dies through the tax year in which the surviving spouse 2481
dies or remarries. 2482
(D) If the owner or the spouse of the owner of a 2483
manufactured or mobile home is eligible for a homestead 2484
exemption on the land upon which the home is located, the 2485
reduction to which the owner or spouse is entitled under this 2486
section shall not exceed the difference between the reduction to 2487
which the owner or spouse is entitled under division (A), (B), 2488
or (C) of this section and the amount of the reduction under the 2489
homestead exemption. 2490

(E) No reduction shall be made with respect to the home of 2491
any person convicted of violating division (C) or (D) of section 2492
4503.066 of the Revised Code for a period of three years 2493
following the conviction. 2494
Sec. 4503.0610. (A) If a board of county commissioners 2495
adopts a resolution granting a partial real property tax 2496
exemption under section 323.158 of the Revised Code, it also 2497
shall adopt a resolution under this section granting a partial 2498
manufactured home tax exemption. The partial exemption shall 2499
take the form of a reduction each year in the manufactured home 2500
tax charged against each manufactured home in the county under 2501
section 4503.06 of the Revised Code, by the same percentage by 2502
which real property taxes were reduced for the preceding year in 2503
the resolution adopted under section 323.158 of the Revised 2504
Code. Upon adopting the resolution under this section, the board 2505
shall certify copies of it to the county auditor and the tax 2506
commissioner. 2507
(B) After complying with sections 319.303, 4503.06, and 2508
4503.065 of the Revised Code, the county auditor shall reduce 2509
the remaining sum to be levied against a manufactured home by 2510
the percentage called for in the resolution adopted under 2511
division (A) of this section. The auditor shall certify the 2512
amount of tax remaining after the reduction to the county 2513
treasurer for collection as the manufactured home tax charged 2514
and payable on the manufactured home. 2515
(C) For each tax year, the county auditor shall certify to 2516
the board of county commissioners the total amount by which 2517
manufactured home taxes are reduced under this section. At the 2518
time of each semi-annual distribution of manufactured home taxes 2519
in the county, the board shall pay to the auditor one-half of 2520

H. B. No. 186 Page 89
As Introduced
that total amount. Upon receipt of the payment, the auditor 2521
shall distribute it among the various taxing districts in the 2522
county as though it had been levied and collected as 2523
manufactured home taxes. The board shall make the payment from 2524
the county general fund or from any other county revenue that 2525
may be used for that purpose. 2526
(D) If a board of county commissioners repeals a 2527
resolution adopted under section 323.158 of the Revised Code, it 2528
also shall repeal the resolution adopted under this section. 2529
Section 2. That existing sections 319.301, 323.08, 2530
323.152, 323.155, 323.158, 3317.017, 3317.02, 3317.021, 3317.16, 2531
4503.06, 4503.065, and 4503.0610 of the Revised Code are hereby 2532
repealed. 2533
Section 3. The enactment by this act of section 319.303 of 2534
the Revised Code applies to tax year 2025 and thereafter, in the 2535
case of property on the real property tax list, and to tax year 2536
2026 and thereafter, in the case of property on the manufactured 2537
home tax list. 2538
Section 4. The General Assembly, applying the principle 2539
stated in division (B) of section 1.52 of the Revised Code that 2540
amendments are to be harmonized if reasonably capable of 2541
simultaneous operation, finds that the following sections, 2542
presented in this act as composites of the sections as amended 2543
by the acts indicated, are the resulting versions of the 2544
