(2) Taxes levied within the one per cent limitation 19

(3) Taxes provided for by the charter of a municipal 21
corporation. 22
(B) As used in this section: 23
(1) "Real property" includes real property owned by a 24
railroad. 25
(2) "Carryover property" means all real property on the 26
current year's tax list except: 27
(a) Land and improvements that were not taxed by the 28
district in both the preceding year and the current year; 29
(b) Land and improvements that were not in the same class 30
in both the preceding year and the current year. 31
(3) "Effective tax rate" means with respect to each class 32
of property: 33
(a) The sum of the total taxes that would have been 34
charged and payable for current expenses against real property 35
in that class if each of the district's taxes were reduced for 36
the current year under division (D)(1) of this section without 37
regard to the application of division (E)(3) of this section 38
divided by 39
(b) The taxable value of all real property in that class. 40
(4) "Taxes charged and payable" means the taxes charged 41
and payable prior to any reduction required by section 319.302 42
or, if applicable, 319.303 of the Revised Code. 43

required by this section each year, without regard to whether a 45

Sub. H. B. No. 186 Page 3
As Reported by the House Finance Committee
taxing district has territory in a county to which section 46
5715.24 of the Revised Code applies for that year. Separate 47
determinations shall be made for each of the two classes 48
established pursuant to section 5713.041 of the Revised Code. 49
(D) With respect to each tax authorized to be levied by 50
each taxing district, the tax commissioner, annually, shall do 51
both of the following: 52
(1) Determine by what percentage, if any, the sums levied 53
by such tax against the carryover property in each class would 54
have to be reduced for the tax to levy the same number of 55
dollars against such property in that class in the current year 56
as were charged against such property by such tax in the 57
preceding year subsequent to the reduction made under this 58
section but before the reduction made under section 319.302 of 59
the Revised Code. In the case of a tax levied for the first time 60
that is not a renewal of an existing tax, the commissioner shall 61
determine by what percentage the sums that would otherwise be 62
levied by such tax against carryover property in each class 63
would have to be reduced to equal the amount that would have 64
been levied if the full rate thereof had been imposed against 65
the total taxable value of such property in the preceding tax 66
year. 67
(2) Certify each percentage determined in division (D)(1) 68
of this section, as adjusted under division (E) of this section, 69
and the class of property to which that percentage applies to 70
the auditor of each county in which the district has territory. 71
The auditor, after complying with section 319.30 of the Revised 72
Code, shall reduce the sum to be levied by such tax against each 73
parcel of real property in the district by the percentage so 74
certified for its class. Certification shall be made by the 75

Sub. H. B. No. 186 Page 4
As Reported by the House Finance Committee
first day of September except in the case of a tax levied for 76
the first time, in which case certification shall be made within 77
fifteen days of the date the county auditor submits the 78
information necessary to make the required determination. 79
(E)(1) As used in division (E)(2) of this section, "pre- 80
1982 joint vocational taxes" means, with respect to a class of 81
property, the difference between the following amounts: 82
(a) The taxes charged and payable in tax year 1981 against 83
the property in that class for the current expenses of the joint 84
vocational school district of which the school district is a 85
part after making all reductions under this section; 86
(b) Two-tenths of one per cent of the taxable value of all 87
real property in that class. 88
If the amount in division (E)(1)(b) of this section 89
exceeds the amount in division (E)(1)(a) of this section, the 90
pre-1982 joint vocational taxes shall be zero. 91
As used in divisions (E)(2) and (3) of this section, 92
"taxes charged and payable" has the same meaning as in division 93
(B)(4) of this section and excludes any tax charged and payable 94
in 1985 or thereafter under sections 5705.194 to 5705.197 or 95
section 5705.199, 5705.213, 5705.219, or 5748.09 of the Revised 96
Code. 97
(2) If in the case of a school district other than a joint 98
vocational or cooperative education school district any 99
percentage required to be used in division (D)(2) of this 100
section for either class of property could cause the total taxes 101
charged and payable for current expenses to be less than two per 102
cent of the taxable value of all real property in that class 103
that is subject to taxation by the district, the commissioner 104

Sub. H. B. No. 186 Page 5
As Reported by the House Finance Committee
shall determine what percentages would cause the district's 105
total taxes charged and payable for current expenses against 106
that class, after all reductions that would otherwise be made 107
under this section, to equal, when combined with the pre-1982 108
joint vocational taxes against that class, the lesser of the 109
following: 110
(a) The sum of the rates at which those taxes are 111
authorized to be levied; 112
(b) Two per cent of the taxable value of the property in 113
that class. The auditor shall use such percentages in making the 114
reduction required by this section for that class. 115
(3) If in the case of a joint vocational school district 116
any percentage required to be used in division (D)(2) of this 117
section for either class of property could cause the total taxes 118
charged and payable for current expenses for that class to be 119
less than two-tenths of one per cent of the taxable value of 120
that class, the commissioner shall determine what percentages 121
would cause the district's total taxes charged and payable for 122
current expenses for that class, after all reductions that would 123
otherwise be made under this section, to equal that amount. The 124
auditor shall use such percentages in making the reductions 125
required by this section for that class. 126
(F) No reduction shall be made under this section in the 127
rate at which any tax is levied. 128
(G) The commissioner may order a county auditor to furnish 129
any information the commissioner needs to make the 130
determinations required under division (D) or (E) of this 131
section, and the auditor shall supply the information in the 132
form and by the date specified in the order. If the auditor 133

Sub. H. B. No. 186 Page 6
As Reported by the House Finance Committee
fails to comply with an order issued under this division, except 134
for good cause as determined by the commissioner, the 135
commissioner shall withhold from such county or taxing district 136
therein fifty per cent of state revenues to local governments 137
pursuant to section 5747.50 of the Revised Code or shall direct 138
the department of education and workforce to withhold therefrom 139
fifty per cent of state revenues to school districts pursuant to 140
Chapter 3317. of the Revised Code. The commissioner shall 141
withhold the distribution of such revenues until the county 142
auditor has complied with this division, and the department 143
shall withhold the distribution of such revenues until the 144
commissioner has notified the department that the county auditor 145
has complied with this division. 146
(H) If the commissioner is unable to certify a tax 147
reduction factor for either class of property in a taxing 148
district located in more than one county by the last day of 149
November because information required under division (G) of this 150
section is unavailable, the commissioner may compute and certify 151
an estimated tax reduction factor for that district for that 152
class. The estimated factor shall be based upon an estimate of 153
the unavailable information. Upon receipt of the actual 154
information for a taxing district that received an estimated tax 155
reduction factor, the commissioner shall compute the actual tax 156
reduction factor and use that factor to compute the taxes that 157
should have been charged and payable against each parcel of 158
property for the year for which the estimated reduction factor 159
was used. The amount by which the estimated factor resulted in 160
an overpayment or underpayment in taxes on any parcel shall be 161
added to or subtracted from the amount due on that parcel in the 162
ensuing tax year. 163
A percentage or a tax reduction factor determined or 164

Sub. H. B. No. 186 Page 7
As Reported by the House Finance Committee
computed by the commissioner under this section shall be used 165
solely for the purpose of reducing the sums to be levied by the 166
tax to which it applies for the year for which it was determined 167
or computed. It shall not be used in making any tax computations 168
for any ensuing tax year. 169
(I) In making the determinations under division (D)(1) of 170
this section, the tax commissioner shall take account of changes 171
in the taxable value of carryover property resulting from 172
complaints filed under section 5715.19 of the Revised Code for 173
determinations made for the tax year in which such changes are 174
reported to the commissioner. Such changes shall be reported to 175
the commissioner on the first abstract of real property filed 176
with the commissioner under section 5715.23 of the Revised Code 177
following the date on which the complaint is finally determined 178
by the board of revision or by a court or other authority with 179
jurisdiction on appeal. The tax commissioner shall account for 180
such changes in making the determinations only for the tax year 181
in which the change in valuation is reported. Such a valuation 182
change shall not be used to recompute the percentages determined 183
under division (D)(1) of this section for any prior tax year. 184

more of its levies under Chapter 5705. of the Revised Code in a 383
tax year, or for which a county budget commission reduces one or 384
more levies under that chapter in a tax year. For purposes of 385
division (F) of this section, the total amount of such 386
reductions made for that tax year, in the case of property other 387
than that described in division (A)(1)(a)(ii) of this section, 388
and for the following tax year, in the case of property 389
described in division (A)(1)(a)(ii) of this section, are 390
referred to as the "district reduction." 391
(2) Notwithstanding divisions (A), (B), and (C) of this 392
section, if division (F) of this section applies to a school 393
district or joint vocational school district in a tax year, 394

Sub. H. B. No. 186 Page 15
As Reported by the House Finance Committee
(a) If the amount of the district reduction applicable to 402
qualifying nonbusiness property or qualifying business property 403
is less than the total amount of credits that would otherwise be 404
allowed under division (B) or (C) of this section for such 405
property for the applicable year, multiply the tax credit factor 406
otherwise computed under division (A)(7) of this section for 407
such property by a fraction, the denominator of which is the 408
total amount of credits that would otherwise be allowed under 409
division (B) or (C) of this section, as applicable, and the 410
numerator of which is the difference between that total credit 411
amount and the district reduction applicable to such property; 412
(b) If the amount of the district reduction applicable to 413
qualifying nonbusiness property or qualifying business property 414
is equal to or greater than the total amount of credits that 415
would otherwise be allowed under division (B) or (C) of this 416
section for such property, the tax credit factor for the 417
applicable tax year shall be zero. 418
(G) The county treasurer shall identify the reduction 419
authorized under this section on each tax bill delivered under 420
section 323.13 or 4503.06 of the Revised Code as the "Inflation 421
Cap Credit." 422
Sec. 323.08. (A) After certifying the tax list and 423
duplicate pursuant to section 319.28 of the Revised Code, the 424

under division (A)(1)(d) of this section, by the amounts 553
described in divisions (A)(1)(c)(ii) to (iv) of this section. 554
The reduction is in lieu of any reduction under section 323.158 555

shall equal two and one-half per cent of the amount of taxes to 607
be levied by qualifying levies on the homestead or the 608

the Revised Code. 610
(3) A board of county commissioners, by resolution, may 611
authorize a partial exemption from the real property taxes or 612
manufactured home taxes on any property or manufactured or 613
mobile home that receives the partial exemption under division 614
(B)(2) of this section. The resolution shall specify the amount 615
of the partial exemption, which may equal up to two and one-half 616
per cent of the amount of taxes to be levied by qualifying 617

exemption shall first apply or cease to apply, in the case of 629
real property taxes, to that tax year or, in the case of 630
manufactured home taxes, the following tax year. If the 631
resolution is adopted after the first day of July of a tax year, 632

(C) The reductions granted by this section do not apply to 637
special assessments or respread of assessments levied against 638
the homestead, and if there is a transfer of ownership 639
subsequent to the filing of an application for a reduction in 640
taxes, such reductions are not forfeited for such year by virtue 641
of such transfer. 642
(D) The reductions in taxable value referred to in this 643
section shall be applied solely as a factor for the purpose of 644
computing the reduction of taxes under this section and shall 645
not affect the total value of property in any subdivision or 646
taxing district as listed and assessed for taxation on the tax 647
lists and duplicates, or any direct or indirect limitations on 648
indebtedness of a subdivision or taxing district. If after 649
application of sections 5705.31 and 5705.32 of the Revised Code, 650
including the allocation of all levies within the ten-mill 651
limitation to debt charges to the extent therein provided, there 652
would be insufficient funds for payment of debt charges not 653
provided for by levies in excess of the ten-mill limitation, the 654
reduction of taxes provided for in sections 323.151 to 323.159 655
of the Revised Code shall be proportionately adjusted to the 656
extent necessary to provide such funds from levies within the 657
ten-mill limitation. 658

of the board of county commissioners levying a sales and use tax 679
under sections 5739.026 and 5741.023 of the Revised Code. 680
(B) On or before December 31, 1996, the board of county 681
commissioners of a qualifying county may adopt a resolution 682
under this section. The resolution shall grant a partial real 683
property tax exemption to each homestead in the county that also 684
receives the tax reduction under division (B)(2) of section 685
323.152 of the Revised Code. The partial exemption shall take 686
the form of the reduction by a specified percentage each year of 687
the real property taxes on the homestead. The resolution shall 688
specify the percentage, which may be any amount. The board may 689
include in the resolution a condition that the partial exemption 690
will apply only upon the receipt by the county of additional 691
revenue from a source specified in the resolution. The 692
resolution shall specify the tax year in which the partial 693
exemption first applies, which may be the tax year in which the 694
resolution takes effect as long as the resolution takes effect 695

Sub. H. B. No. 186 Page 25

auditor shall reduce the remaining sum to be levied against a 702
homestead by the percentage called for in the resolution adopted 703
under division (B) of this section. The auditor shall certify 704
the amount of taxes remaining after the reduction to the county 705
treasurer for collection as the real property taxes charged and 706
payable on the homestead. 707
(D) For each tax year, the county auditor shall certify to 708
the board of county commissioners the total amount by which real 709
property taxes were reduced under this section. At the time of 710
each semi-annual settlement of real property taxes between the 711
county auditor and county treasurer, the board of county 712
commissioners shall pay to the auditor one-half of that total 713
amount. Upon receipt of the payment, the county auditor shall 714
distribute it among the various taxing districts in the county 715
as if it had been levied, collected, and settled as real 716
property taxes. The board of county commissioners shall make the 717
payment from the county general fund or from any other county 718
revenue that may be used for that purpose. In making the 719
payment, the board may use revenue from taxes levied by the 720
county to provide additional general revenue under sections 721
5739.021 and 5741.021 of the Revised Code or to provide 722
additional revenue for the county general fund under sections 723
5739.026 and 5741.023 of the Revised Code. 724

(F) At any time, the board of county commissioners may 730
adopt a resolution amending or repealing the partial exemption 731
granted under this section. Upon adopting a resolution amending 732
or repealing the partial exemption, the board shall certify 733
copies of it to the county auditor and the tax commissioner. The 734
resolution shall specify the tax year in which the amendment or 735
repeal first applies, which may be the tax year in which the 736
resolution takes effect as long as the resolution takes effect 737
before the county auditor certifies the tax duplicate of real 738
and public utility property for that tax year to the county 739
treasurer. 740
(G) If a person files a late application for a tax 741
reduction under division (B)(2) of section 323.152 of the 742
Revised Code for the preceding year, and is granted the 743
reduction, the person also shall receive the reduction under 744
this section for the preceding year. The county auditor shall 745
credit the amount of the reduction against the person's current 746
year taxes, and shall include the amount of the reduction in the 747
amount certified to the board of county commissioners under 748
division (D) of this section. 749

(a) By multiplying the assessable value of the home by the 850
effective tax rate, as defined in section 323.08 of the Revised 851
Code, for residential real property of the taxing district in 852
which the home has its situs, and deducting from the product 853
thus obtained the reductions required or authorized under 854
section 319.302, 319.303, 319.304, or 4503.065 or division (B) 855
of section 323.152 of the Revised Code. 856
(b) The assessable value of the home shall be thirty-five 857
per cent of its true value as determined under division (L) of 858
this section. 859
(3) On or before the fifteenth day of January each year, 860

the case of an emergency as defined in section 323.17 of the 864
Revised Code, the tax commissioner, by journal entry, may extend 865
the times for delivery of the duplicate for an additional 866
fifteen days upon receiving a written application from the 867
county auditor regarding an extension for the delivery of the 868
duplicate, or from the county treasurer regarding an extension 869
of the time for the billing and collection of taxes. The 870
application shall contain a statement describing the emergency 871
that will cause the unavoidable delay and must be received by 872
the tax commissioner on or before the last day of the month 873
preceding the day delivery of the duplicate is otherwise 874
required. When an extension is granted for delivery of the 875
duplicate, the time period for payment of taxes shall be 876
extended for a like period of time. When a delay in the closing 877
of a tax collection period becomes unavoidable, the tax 878
commissioner, upon application by the county auditor and county 879
treasurer, may order the time for payment of taxes to be 880
extended if the tax commissioner determines that penalties have 881
accrued or would otherwise accrue for reasons beyond the control 882
of the taxpayers of the county. The order shall prescribe the 883
final extended date for payment of taxes for that collection 884
period. 885

this section by filing a written request with the county auditor 889
of the taxing district in which the home is located on or before 890
the first day of December of any year. Upon the filing of the 891
request, the county auditor shall determine whether all taxes 892
levied under division (D)(1) of this section have been paid, and 893
if those taxes have been paid, the county auditor shall tax the 894

Sub. H. B. No. 186 Page 33

manufactured or mobile home pursuant to division (D)(2) of this 895
section commencing in the next tax year. 896
(5) A manufactured or mobile home that acquired situs in 897
this state prior to January 1, 2000, shall be taxed pursuant to 898
division (D)(2) of this section if no manufactured home tax had 899
been paid for the home and the home was not exempted from 900
taxation pursuant to division (E) of this section for the year 901
for which the taxes were not paid. 902
(6)(a) Immediately upon receipt of any manufactured home 903
tax duplicate from the county auditor, but not less than twenty 904
days prior to the last date on which the first one-half taxes 905
may be paid without penalty as prescribed in division (F) of 906
this section, the county treasurer shall cause to be prepared 907
and mailed or delivered to each person charged on that duplicate 908
with taxes, or to an agent designated by such person, the tax 909
bill prescribed by the tax commissioner under division (D)(7) of 910
this section. When taxes are paid by installments, the county 911
treasurer shall mail or deliver to each person charged on such 912
duplicate or the agent designated by that person a second tax 913
bill showing the amount due at the time of the second tax 914
collection. The second half tax bill shall be mailed or 915
delivered at least twenty days prior to the close of the second 916
half tax collection period. A change in the mailing address, 917
electronic mail address, or telephone number of any tax bill 918
shall be made in writing to the county treasurer. Failure to 919
receive a bill required by this section does not excuse failure 920
or delay to pay any taxes shown on the bill or, except as 921
provided in division (B)(1) of section 5715.39 of the Revised 922
Code, avoid any penalty, interest, or charge for such delay. 923
A policy adopted by a county treasurer under division (A) 924

Sub. H. B. No. 186 Page 34
As Reported by the House Finance Committee
(2) of section 323.13 of the Revised Code shall also allow any 925
person required to receive a tax bill under division (D)(6)(a) 926
of this section to request electronic delivery of that tax bill 927
in the same manner. A person may rescind such a request in the 928
same manner as a request made under division (A)(2) of section 929
323.13 of the Revised Code. The request shall terminate upon a 930
change in the name of the person charged with the taxes pursuant 931
to section 4503.061 of the Revised Code. 932
(b) After delivery of the copy of the delinquent 933
manufactured home tax list under division (H) of this section, 934
the county treasurer may prepare and mail to each person in 935
whose name a home is listed an additional tax bill showing the 936
total amount of delinquent taxes charged against the home as 937
shown on the list. The tax bill shall include a notice that the 938
interest charge prescribed by division (G) of this section has 939
begun to accrue. 940
(7) Each tax bill prepared and mailed or delivered under 941
division (D)(6) of this section shall be in the form and contain 942
the information required by the tax commissioner. The 943
commissioner may prescribe different forms for each county and 944
may authorize the county auditor to make up tax bills and tax 945
receipts to be used by the county treasurer. The tax bill shall 946
not contain or be mailed or delivered with any information or 947
material that is not required by this section or that is not 948
authorized by section 321.45 of the Revised Code or by the tax 949
commissioner. In addition to the information required by the 950
commissioner, each tax bill shall contain the following 951
information: 952

paid within sixty days after the county auditor delivers the 956
delinquent manufactured home tax list to the county treasurer, 957
you and your home may be subject to collection proceedings for 958
tax delinquency." Failure to provide such notice has no effect 959
upon the validity of any tax judgment to which a home may be 960
subjected. 961
(c) In the case of manufactured or mobile homes taxed 962
under division (D)(2) of this section, the following additional 963
information: 964
(i) The effective tax rate. The words "effective tax rate" 965
shall appear in boldface type. 966
(ii) The following notice: "Notice: If the taxes charged 967
against this home have been reduced by the 2-1/2 per cent tax 968
reduction for residences occupied by the owner but the home is 969
not a residence occupied by the owner, the owner must notify the 970
county auditor's office not later than March 31 of the year for 971
which the taxes are due. Failure to do so may result in the 972
owner being convicted of a fourth degree misdemeanor, which is 973
punishable by imprisonment up to 30 days, a fine up to $250, or 974
both, and in the owner having to repay the amount by which the 975
taxes were erroneously or illegally reduced, plus any interest 976
that may apply. 977
If the taxes charged against this home have not been 978
reduced by the 2-1/2 per cent tax reduction and the home is a 979
residence occupied by the owner, the home may qualify for the 980
tax reduction. To obtain an application for the tax reduction or 981
further information, the owner may contact the county auditor's 982
office at __________ (insert the address and telephone number of 983
the county auditor's office)." 984

on or before the thirty-first day of July, next thereafter, or 1045
on or before the last day for payment as extended pursuant to 1046
section 4503.063 of the Revised Code, a like penalty shall be 1047

(b) After a valid delinquent tax contract that includes 1050
unpaid current taxes from a first-half collection period 1051
described in division (F) of this section has been entered into 1052
under section 323.31 of the Revised Code, no ten per cent 1053
penalty shall be charged against such taxes after the second- 1054
half collection period while the delinquent tax contract remains 1055
in effect. On the day a delinquent tax contract becomes void, 1056
the ten per cent penalty shall be charged against such taxes and 1057
shall equal the amount of penalty that would have been charged 1058
against unpaid current taxes outstanding on the date on which 1059
the second-half penalty would have been charged thereon under 1060

Code and shall be entered as a separate item on the delinquent 1074
manufactured home tax list compiled under division (H) of this 1075
section. 1076
(b) On the first day of December beginning in 2000, the 1077
interest shall be charged against and computed on all delinquent 1078
taxes. The charge shall be for interest that accrued during the 1079
period that began on the first day of the month following the 1080
last date prescribed for the payment of the second installment 1081
of taxes in the current year and ended on the immediately 1082
preceding last day of November. The interest shall be computed 1083
at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the 1084
Revised Code and shall be entered as a separate item on the 1085
delinquent manufactured home tax list. 1086
(c) After a valid undertaking has been entered into for 1087
the payment of any delinquent taxes, no interest shall be 1088
charged against such delinquent taxes while the undertaking 1089

that interest was not permitted to be charged while the 1093
undertaking was in effect. The interest shall be charged on the 1094
day the undertaking becomes void and shall equal the amount of 1095
interest that would have been charged against the unpaid 1096
delinquent taxes outstanding on the dates on which interest 1097
would have been charged thereon under divisions (G)(1) and (2) 1098
of this section had the undertaking not been in effect. 1099
(3) If the full amount of the taxes due at either of the 1100
times prescribed by division (F) of this section is paid within 1101
ten days after such time, the county treasurer shall waive the 1102
collection of and the county auditor shall remit one-half of the 1103

penalty provided for in this division for failure to make that 1104
payment by the prescribed time. 1105
(4) The treasurer shall compile and deliver to the county 1106
auditor a list of all tax payments the treasurer has received as 1107
provided in division (G)(3) of this section. The list shall 1108
include any information required by the auditor for the 1109
remission of the penalties waived by the treasurer. The taxes so 1110
collected shall be included in the settlement next succeeding 1111
the settlement then in process. 1112
(H)(1) The county auditor shall compile annually a 1113
"delinquent manufactured home tax list" consisting of homes the 1114
county treasurer's records indicate have taxes that were not 1115
paid within the time prescribed by divisions (D)(3) and (F) of 1116
this section, have taxes that remain unpaid from prior years, or 1117
have unpaid tax penalties or interest that have been assessed. 1118
(2) Within thirty days after the settlement under division 1119
(H)(2) of section 321.24 of the Revised Code, the county auditor 1120
shall deliver a copy of the delinquent manufactured home tax 1121
list to the county treasurer. The auditor shall update and 1122
publish the delinquent manufactured home tax list annually in 1123
the same manner as delinquent real property tax lists are 1124
published. The county auditor may apportion the cost of 1125
publishing the list among taxing districts in proportion to the 1126
amount of delinquent manufactured home taxes so published that 1127
each taxing district is entitled to receive upon collection of 1128
those taxes, or the county auditor may charge the owner of a 1129
home on the list a flat fee established under section 319.54 of 1130
the Revised Code for the cost of publishing the list and, if the 1131
fee is not paid, may place the fee upon the delinquent 1132
manufactured home tax list as a lien on the listed home, to be 1133

Sub. H. B. No. 186 Page 41

collected as other manufactured home taxes. 1134
(3) When taxes, penalties, or interest are charged against 1135
a person on the delinquent manufactured home tax list and are 1136
not paid within sixty days after the list is delivered to the 1137
county treasurer, the county treasurer shall, in addition to any 1138
other remedy provided by law for the collection of taxes, 1139
penalties, and interest, enforce collection of such taxes, 1140
penalties, and interest by civil action in the name of the 1141
treasurer against the owner for the recovery of the unpaid taxes 1142
following the procedures for the recovery of delinquent real 1143
property taxes in sections 323.25 to 323.28 of the Revised Code. 1144
The action may be brought in municipal or county court, provided 1145
the amount charged does not exceed the monetary limitations for 1146
original jurisdiction for civil actions in those courts. 1147
It is sufficient, having made proper parties to the suit, 1148
for the county treasurer to allege in the treasurer's bill of 1149
particulars or petition that the taxes stand chargeable on the 1150
books of the county treasurer against such person, that they are 1151
due and unpaid, and that such person is indebted in the amount 1152
of taxes appearing to be due the county. The treasurer need not 1153
set forth any other matter relating thereto. If it is found on 1154
the trial of the action that the person is indebted to the 1155
state, judgment shall be rendered in favor of the county 1156
treasurer prosecuting the action. The judgment debtor is not 1157
entitled to the benefit of any law for stay of execution or 1158
exemption of property from levy or sale on execution in the 1159
enforcement of the judgment. 1160
Upon the filing of an entry of confirmation of sale or an 1161
order of forfeiture in a proceeding brought under this division, 1162
title to the manufactured or mobile home shall be in the 1163

Sub. H. B. No. 186 Page 42
As Reported by the House Finance Committee
purchaser. The clerk of courts shall issue a certificate of 1164
title to the purchaser upon presentation of proof of filing of 1165
the entry of confirmation or order and, in the case of a 1166
forfeiture, presentation of the county auditor's certificate of 1167
sale. 1168
(I) The total amount of taxes collected shall be 1169
distributed in the following manner: four per cent shall be 1170
allowed as compensation to the county auditor for the county 1171
auditor's service in assessing the taxes; two per cent shall be 1172
allowed as compensation to the county treasurer for the services 1173
the county treasurer renders as a result of the tax levied by 1174
this section. Such amounts shall be paid into the county 1175
treasury, to the credit of the county general revenue fund, on 1176
the warrant of the county auditor. Fees to be paid to the credit 1177
of the real estate assessment fund shall be collected pursuant 1178
to division (C) of section 319.54 of the Revised Code and paid 1179
into the county treasury, on the warrant of the county auditor. 1180
The balance of the taxes collected shall be distributed among 1181
the taxing subdivisions of the county in which the taxes are 1182
collected and paid in the same proportions that the amount of 1183
manufactured home tax levied by each taxing subdivision of the 1184
county in the current tax year bears to the amount of such tax 1185
levied by all such subdivisions in the county in the current tax 1186
year. The taxes levied and revenues collected under this section 1187
shall be in lieu of any general property tax and any tax levied 1188
with respect to the privilege of using or occupying a 1189
manufactured or mobile home in this state except as provided in 1190
sections 4503.04 and 5741.02 of the Revised Code. 1191
(J) An agreement to purchase or a bill of sale for a 1192
manufactured home shall show whether or not the furnishings and 1193
equipment are included in the purchase price. 1194

As Reported by the House Finance Committee
(K) If the county treasurer and the county prosecuting 1195
attorney agree that an item charged on the delinquent 1196
manufactured home tax list is uncollectible, they shall certify 1197
that determination and the reasons to the county board of 1198
revision. If the board determines the amount is uncollectible, 1199
it shall certify its determination to the county auditor, who 1200
shall strike the item from the list. 1201
(L)(1) The county auditor shall appraise at its true value 1202
any manufactured or mobile home in which ownership is 1203
transferred or which first acquires situs in this state on or 1204
after January 1, 2000, and any manufactured or mobile home the 1205
owner of which has elected, under division (D)(4) of this 1206
section, to have the home taxed under division (D)(2) of this 1207
section. The true value shall include the value of the home, any 1208
additions, and any fixtures, but not any furnishings in the 1209
home. In determining the true value of a manufactured or mobile 1210
home, the auditor shall consider all facts and circumstances 1211
relating to the value of the home, including its age, its 1212
capacity to function as a residence, any obsolete 1213
characteristics, and other factors that may tend to prove its 1214
true value. 1215
(2)(a) If a manufactured or mobile home has been the 1216
subject of an arm's length sale between a willing seller and a 1217
willing buyer within a reasonable length of time prior to the 1218
determination of true value, the county auditor shall consider 1219
the sale price of the home to be the true value for taxation 1220
purposes. 1221
(b) The sale price in an arm's length transaction between 1222
a willing seller and a willing buyer shall not be considered the 1223
true value of the home if either of the following occurred after 1224

Sub. H. B. No. 186 Page 44
As Reported by the House Finance Committee
the sale: 1225
(i) The home has lost value due to a casualty. 1226
(ii) An addition or fixture has been added to the home. 1227
(3) The county auditor shall have each home viewed and 1228
appraised at least once in each six-year period in the same year 1229
in which real property in the county is appraised pursuant to 1230
Chapter 5713. of the Revised Code, and shall update the 1231
appraised values in the third calendar year following the 1232
appraisal. The person viewing or appraising a home may enter the 1233
home to determine by actual view any additions or fixtures that 1234
have been added since the last appraisal. In conducting the 1235
appraisals and establishing the true value, the auditor shall 1236
follow the procedures set forth for appraising real property in 1237
sections 5713.01 and 5713.03 of the Revised Code. 1238
(4) The county auditor shall place the true value of each 1239
home on the manufactured home tax list upon completion of an 1240
appraisal. 1241
(5)(a) If the county auditor changes the true value of a 1242
home, the auditor shall notify the owner of the home in writing, 1243
delivered by mail or in person. The notice shall be given at 1244
least thirty days prior to the issuance of any tax bill that 1245
reflects the change. Failure to receive the notice does not 1246
invalidate any proceeding under this section. 1247
(b) Any owner of a home or any other person or party that 1248
would be authorized to file a complaint under division (A) of 1249
section 5715.19 of the Revised Code if the home was real 1250
property may file a complaint against the true value of the home 1251
as appraised under this section. The complaint shall be filed 1252

that total amount. Upon receipt of the payment, the auditor 1560
shall distribute it among the various taxing districts in the 1561
county as though it had been levied and collected as 1562
manufactured home taxes. The board shall make the payment from 1563
the county general fund or from any other county revenue that 1564
may be used for that purpose. 1565

tax year 2025, in the case of property on the real property tax 1602

Budget and Management shall delay the certification required to 1728
be made under division (B)(2) of that section in 2026 until 1729
August 30, 2026. 1730
Section 6. Section 323.152 of the Revised Code as 1731
presented in this act takes effect on the later of January 1, 1732
2026, or the effective date of this section. (January 1, 2026, 1733
is the effective date of an earlier amendment to that section by 1734
H.B. 96 of the 136th General Assembly.) 1735

accounted for as though made in, and are subject to all 1742
applicable provisions of, H.B. 96 of the 136th General Assembly. 1743
Section 8. Section 4503.065 of the Revised Code is 1744
presented in this act as a composite of the section as amended 1745
by both H.B. 33 and S.B. 43 of the 135th General Assembly. The 1746
General Assembly, applying the principle stated in division (B) 1747
of section 1.52 of the Revised Code that amendments are to be 1748
harmonized if reasonably capable of simultaneous operation, 1749
finds that the composite is the resulting version of the section 1750
in effect prior to the effective date of the section as 1751
presented in this act. 1752
