director that two years or more have elapsed since the order 225

Sec. 4151.06. (A) If a court, pursuant to an action 248

court shall order each appropriate agency to permanently revoke 252
any license issued by the agency and held by the nonresidential 253
construction contractor, subcontractor, or labor broker specific 254

S. B. No. 183 Page 10
As Introduced
to the business location where the unauthorized alien performed 255
work. If the nonresidential construction contractor, 256
subcontractor, or labor broker does not hold a license specific 257
to the business location where the unauthorized alien performed 258
work, but a license is necessary to operate the nonresidential 259
construction contractor's, subcontractor's, or labor broker's 260
business in general, the court shall order the appropriate 261
agency to permanently revoke all licenses issued by that agency 262
that are held by the nonresidential construction contractor, 263
subcontractor, or labor broker at the nonresidential 264
construction contractor's, subcontractor's, or labor broker's 265

with respect to that alien's immigration status made by the 271
federal government pursuant to the federal "Omnibus Consolidated 272
Appropriations Act, 1997," 8 U.S.C. 1373(c). The federal 273
government's determination creates a rebuttable presumption of 274
the alien's lawful status. The court may take judicial notice of 275
the federal government's determination and may request the 276
federal government to provide automated or testimonial 277
verification pursuant to the federal "Omnibus Consolidated 278
Appropriations Act, 1997," 8 U.S.C. 1373(c). 279

requiring compliance with sections 4151.02 and 4151.03 of the 285

Revised Code. 286
(B) Each state agency or political subdivision that fails 287
to include provisions requiring compliance with sections 4151.02 288
and 4151.03 of the Revised Code in a contract for the 289
construction or renovation of a nonresidential construction 290
project shall be fined five thousand dollars for each failure. 291
