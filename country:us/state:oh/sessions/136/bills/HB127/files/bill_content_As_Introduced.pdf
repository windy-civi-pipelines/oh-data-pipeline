"Health care facility" has the same meaning as in section 596

H. B. No. 127 Page 22
As Introduced
1337.11 of the Revised Code. 597
"Protected health information" has the same meaning as in 598

"Law enforcement agency" means a government entity that 600
employs peace officers to perform law enforcement duties. 601

(B)(1) Upon request by any person and subject to division 610
(B)(8) of this section, all public records responsive to the 611
request shall be promptly prepared and made available for 612
inspection to the requester at all reasonable times during 613
regular business hours. Subject to division (B)(8) of this 614
section, upon request by any person, a public office or person 615
responsible for public records shall make copies of the 616
requested public record available to the requester at cost and 617
within a reasonable period of time. 618
When considering whether a state or local law enforcement 619
agency promptly prepared a video record for inspection or 620
provided a video record for production within a reasonable 621
period of time, in addition to any other factors, a court shall 622
consider the time required for a state or local law enforcement 623
agency to retrieve, download, review, redact, seek legal advice 624
regarding, and produce the video record. Notwithstanding any 625

H. B. No. 127 Page 23
As Introduced
other requirement set forth in Chapter 149. of the Revised Code, 626
a state or local law enforcement agency may charge a requester 627
the actual cost associated with preparing a video record for 628
inspection or production, not to exceed seventy-five dollars per 629
hour of video produced, nor seven hundred fifty dollars total. 630
As used in this division, "actual cost," with respect to video 631
records only, means all costs incurred by the state or local law 632
enforcement agency in reviewing, blurring or otherwise 633
obscuring, redacting, uploading, or producing the video records, 634
including but not limited to the storage medium on which the 635
record is produced, staff time, and any other relevant overhead 636
necessary to comply with the request. A state or local law 637
enforcement agency may include in its public records policy the 638
requirement that a requester pay the estimated actual cost 639
before beginning the process of preparing a video record for 640
inspection or production. Where a state or local law enforcement 641
agency imposes such a requirement, its obligation to produce a 642
video or make it available for inspection begins once the 643
estimated actual cost is paid in full by the requester. A state 644
or local law enforcement agency shall provide the requester with 645
the estimated actual cost within five business days of receipt 646
of the public records request. If the actual cost exceeds the 647
estimated actual cost, a state or local law enforcement agency 648
may charge a requester for the difference upon fulfilling a 649
request for video records if the requester is notified in 650
advance that the actual cost may be up to twenty per cent higher 651
than the estimated actual cost. A state or local law enforcement 652
agency shall not charge a requester a difference that exceeds 653
twenty per cent of the estimated actual cost. 654
If a public record contains information that is exempt 655
from the duty to permit public inspection or to copy the public 656

H. B. No. 127 Page 24
As Introduced
record, the public office or the person responsible for the 657
public record shall make available all of the information within 658
the public record that is not exempt. When making that public 659
record available for public inspection or copying that public 660
record, the public office or the person responsible for the 661
public record shall notify the requester of any redaction or 662
make the redaction plainly visible. A redaction shall be deemed 663
a denial of a request to inspect or copy the redacted 664
information, except if federal or state law authorizes or 665
requires a public office to make the redaction. When the auditor 666
of state receives a request to inspect or to make a copy of a 667
record that was provided to the auditor of state for purposes of 668
an audit, but the original public office has asserted to the 669
auditor of state that the record is not a public record, the 670
auditor of state may handle the requests by directing the 671
requestor to the original public office that provided the record 672
to the auditor of state. 673
(2) To facilitate broader access to public records, a 674
public office or the person responsible for public records shall 675
organize and maintain public records in a manner that they can 676
be made available for inspection or copying in accordance with 677
division (B) of this section. A public office also shall have 678
available a copy of its current records retention schedule at a 679
location readily available to the public. If a requester makes 680
an ambiguous or overly broad request or has difficulty in making 681
a request for copies or inspection of public records under this 682
section such that the public office or the person responsible 683
for the requested public record cannot reasonably identify what 684
public records are being requested, the public office or the 685
person responsible for the requested public record may deny the 686
request but shall provide the requester with an opportunity to 687

H. B. No. 127 Page 25
As Introduced
revise the request by informing the requester of the manner in 688
which records are maintained by the public office and accessed 689
in the ordinary course of the public office's or person's 690
duties. 691
(3) If a request is ultimately denied, in part or in 692
whole, the public office or the person responsible for the 693
requested public record shall provide the requester with an 694
explanation, including legal authority, setting forth why the 695
request was denied. If the initial request was provided in 696
writing, the explanation also shall be provided to the requester 697
in writing. The explanation shall not preclude the public office 698
or the person responsible for the requested public record from 699
relying upon additional reasons or legal authority in defending 700
an action commenced under division (C) of this section. 701
(4) Unless specifically required or authorized by state or 702
federal law or in accordance with division (B) of this section, 703
no public office or person responsible for public records may 704
limit or condition the availability of public records by 705
requiring disclosure of the requester's identity or the intended 706
use of the requested public record. Any requirement that the 707
requester disclose the requester's identity or the intended use 708
of the requested public record constitutes a denial of the 709
request. 710
(5) A public office or person responsible for public 711
records may ask a requester to make the request in writing, may 712
ask for the requester's identity, and may inquire about the 713
intended use of the information requested, but may do so only 714
after disclosing to the requester that a written request is not 715
mandatory, that the requester may decline to reveal the 716
requester's identity or the intended use, and when a written 717

H. B. No. 127 Page 26
As Introduced
request or disclosure of the identity or intended use would 718
benefit the requester by enhancing the ability of the public 719
office or person responsible for public records to identify, 720
locate, or deliver the public records sought by the requester. 721
(6) If any person requests a copy of a public record in 722
accordance with division (B) of this section, the public office 723
or person responsible for the public record may require the 724
requester to pay in advance the cost involved in providing the 725
copy of the public record in accordance with the choice made by 726
the requester under this division. The public office or the 727
person responsible for the public record shall permit the 728
requester to choose to have the public record duplicated upon 729
paper, upon the same medium upon which the public office or 730
person responsible for the public record keeps it, or upon any 731
other medium upon which the public office or person responsible 732
for the public record determines that it reasonably can be 733
duplicated as an integral part of the normal operations of the 734
public office or person responsible for the public record. When 735
the requester makes a choice under this division, the public 736
office or person responsible for the public record shall provide 737
a copy of it in accordance with the choice made by the 738
requester. Nothing in this section requires a public office or 739
person responsible for the public record to allow the requester 740
of a copy of the public record to make the copies of the public 741
record. 742
(7)(a) Upon a request made in accordance with division (B) 743
of this section and subject to division (B)(6) of this section, 744
a public office or person responsible for public records shall 745
transmit a copy of a public record to any person by United 746
States mail or by any other means of delivery or transmission 747
within a reasonable period of time after receiving the request 748

H. B. No. 127 Page 27
As Introduced
for the copy. The public office or person responsible for the 749
public record may require the person making the request to pay 750
in advance the cost of postage if the copy is transmitted by 751
United States mail or the cost of delivery if the copy is 752
transmitted other than by United States mail, and to pay in 753
advance the costs incurred for other supplies used in the 754
mailing, delivery, or transmission. 755
(b) Any public office may adopt a policy and procedures 756
that it will follow in transmitting, within a reasonable period 757
of time after receiving a request, copies of public records by 758
United States mail or by any other means of delivery or 759
transmission pursuant to division (B)(7) of this section. A 760
public office that adopts a policy and procedures under division 761
(B)(7) of this section shall comply with them in performing its 762
duties under that division. 763
(c) In any policy and procedures adopted under division 764
(B)(7) of this section: 765
(i) A public office may limit the number of records 766
requested by a person that the office will physically deliver by 767
United States mail or by another delivery service to ten per 768
month, unless the person certifies to the office in writing that 769
the person does not intend to use or forward the requested 770
records, or the information contained in them, for commercial 771
purposes; 772
(ii) A public office that chooses to provide some or all 773
of its public records on a web site that is fully accessible to 774
and searchable by members of the public at all times, other than 775
during acts of God outside the public office's control or 776
maintenance, and that charges no fee to search, access, 777
download, or otherwise receive records provided on the web site, 778

H. B. No. 127 Page 28
As Introduced
may limit to ten per month the number of records requested by a 779
person that the office will deliver in a digital format, unless 780
the requested records are not provided on the web site and 781
unless the person certifies to the office in writing that the 782
person does not intend to use or forward the requested records, 783
or the information contained in them, for commercial purposes. 784
(iii) For purposes of division (B)(7) of this section, 785
"commercial" shall be narrowly construed and does not include 786
reporting or gathering news, reporting or gathering information 787
to assist citizen oversight or understanding of the operation or 788
activities of government, or nonprofit educational research. 789
(8) A public office or person responsible for public 790
records is not required to permit a person who is incarcerated 791
pursuant to a criminal conviction or a juvenile adjudication to 792
inspect or to obtain a copy of any public record concerning a 793
criminal investigation or prosecution or concerning what would 794
be a criminal investigation or prosecution if the subject of the 795
investigation or prosecution were an adult, unless the request 796
to inspect or to obtain a copy of the record is for the purpose 797
of acquiring information that is subject to release as a public 798
record under this section and the judge who imposed the sentence 799
or made the adjudication with respect to the person, or the 800
judge's successor in office, finds that the information sought 801
in the public record is necessary to support what appears to be 802
a justiciable claim of the person. As used in this division, 803
"public record concerning a criminal investigation or 804
prosecution or concerning what would be a criminal investigation 805
or prosecution if the subject of the investigation were an 806
adult" includes, but is not limited to, personnel files and 807
payroll and attendance records of designated public service 808
workers. 809

service worker's spouse, former spouse, or child is employed by 816
a public office, the name and address of the employer of the 817
designated public service worker's spouse, former spouse, or 818

(3) If a requester transmits a written request by hand 903
delivery, electronic submission, or certified mail to inspect or 904
receive copies of any public record in a manner that fairly 905
describes the public record or class of public records to the 906
public office or person responsible for the requested public 907
records, except as otherwise provided in this section, the 908
requester shall be entitled to recover the amount of statutory 909
damages set forth in this division if a court determines that 910
the public office or the person responsible for public records 911
failed to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 912
(B) of this section. Statutory damages are not available 913
pursuant to this section to a person committed to the custody of 914
the department of rehabilitation and correction or the United 915
States bureau of prisons, or a child committed to the department 916
of youth services as permitted in Chapter 2152. of the Revised 917

failed to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 922
(B) of this section, beginning with the day on which the 923
requester files a mandamus action to recover statutory damages, 924
up to a maximum of one thousand dollars. The award of statutory 925
damages shall not be construed as a penalty, but as compensation 926
for injury arising from lost use of the requested information. 927
The existence of this injury shall be conclusively presumed. The 928
award of statutory damages shall be in addition to all other 929
remedies authorized by this section. 930

The court may reduce an award of statutory damages or not 931
award statutory damages if the court determines both of the 932
following: 933
(a) That, based on the ordinary application of statutory 934
law and case law as it existed at the time of the conduct or 935
threatened conduct of the public office or person responsible 936
for the requested public records that allegedly constitutes a 937
failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 938
(B) of this section and that was the basis of the mandamus 939
action, a well-informed public office or person responsible for 940
the requested public records reasonably would believe that the 941
conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or person 942
responsible for the requested public records did not constitute 943
a failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with 944
division (B) of this section; 945
(b) That a well-informed public office or person 946
responsible for the requested public records reasonably would 947
believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of the public 948
office or person responsible for the requested public records 949
would serve the public policy that underlies the authority that 950
is asserted as permitting that conduct or threatened conduct. 951
(4) In a mandamus action filed under division (C)(1) of 952
this section, the following apply: 953
(a)(i) If the court orders the public office or the person 954
responsible for the public record to comply with division (B) of 955
this section, the court shall determine and award to the relator 956
all court costs, which shall be construed as remedial and not 957
punitive. 958
(ii) If the court makes a determination described in 959

division (C)(4)(b)(iii) of this section, the court shall 960
determine and award to the relator all court costs, which shall 961
be construed as remedial and not punitive. 962
(b) If the court renders a judgment that orders the public 963
office or the person responsible for the public record to comply 964
with division (B) of this section or if the court determines any 965
of the following, the court may award reasonable attorney's fees 966
to the relator, subject to division (C)(5) of this section: 967
(i) The public office or the person responsible for the 968
public records failed to respond affirmatively or negatively to 969
the public records request in accordance with the time allowed 970
under division (B) of this section. 971
(ii) The public office or the person responsible for the 972
public records promised to permit the relator to inspect or 973
receive copies of the public records requested within a 974
specified period of time but failed to fulfill that promise 975
within that specified period of time. 976
(iii) The public office or the person responsible for the 977
public records acted in bad faith when the office or person 978
voluntarily made the public records available to the relator for 979
the first time after the relator commenced the mandamus action, 980
but before the court issued any order concluding whether or not 981
the public office or person was required to comply with division 982
(B) of this section. No discovery may be conducted on the issue 983
of the alleged bad faith of the public office or person 984
responsible for the public records. This division shall not be 985
construed as creating a presumption that the public office or 986
the person responsible for the public records acted in bad faith 987
when the office or person voluntarily made the public records 988
available to the relator for the first time after the relator 989

H. B. No. 127 Page 35

commenced the mandamus action, but before the court issued any 990
order described in this division. 991
(c) The court shall not award attorney's fees to the 992
relator if the court determines both of the following: 993
(i) That, based on the ordinary application of statutory 994
law and case law as it existed at the time of the conduct or 995
threatened conduct of the public office or person responsible 996
for the requested public records that allegedly constitutes a 997
failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 998
(B) of this section and that was the basis of the mandamus 999
action, a well-informed public office or person responsible for 1000
the requested public records reasonably would believe that the 1001
conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or person 1002
responsible for the requested public records did not constitute 1003
a failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with 1004
division (B) of this section; 1005
(ii) That a well-informed public office or person 1006
responsible for the requested public records reasonably would 1007
believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of the public 1008
office or person responsible for the requested public records 1009
would serve the public policy that underlies the authority that 1010
is asserted as permitting that conduct or threatened conduct. 1011
(5) All of the following apply to any award of reasonable 1012
attorney's fees awarded under division (C)(4)(b) of this 1013
section: 1014
(a) The fees shall be construed as remedial and not 1015
punitive. 1016
(b) The fees awarded shall not exceed the total of the 1017
reasonable attorney's fees incurred before the public record was 1018

(C)(5)(c) of this section. 1020
(c) Reasonable attorney's fees shall include reasonable 1021
fees incurred to produce proof of the reasonableness and amount 1022
of the fees and to otherwise litigate entitlement to the fees. 1023
(d) The court may reduce the amount of fees awarded if the 1024
court determines that, given the factual circumstances involved 1025
with the specific public records request, an alternative means 1026
should have been pursued to more effectively and efficiently 1027
resolve the dispute that was subject to the mandamus action 1028
filed under division (C)(1) of this section. 1029
(6) If the court does not issue a writ of mandamus under 1030
division (C) of this section and the court determines at that 1031
time that the bringing of the mandamus action was frivolous 1032
conduct as defined in division (A) of section 2323.51 of the 1033
Revised Code, the court may award to the public office all court 1034
costs, expenses, and reasonable attorney's fees, as determined 1035
by the court. 1036
(D) Chapter 1347. of the Revised Code does not limit the 1037
provisions of this section. 1038
(E)(1) To ensure that all employees of public offices are 1039
appropriately educated about a public office's obligations under 1040
division (B) of this section, all elected officials or their 1041
appropriate designees shall attend training approved by the 1042
attorney general as provided in section 109.43 of the Revised 1043
Code. A future official may satisfy the requirements of this 1044

(2) All public offices shall adopt a public records policy 1048
in compliance with this section for responding to public records 1049
requests. In adopting a public records policy under this 1050
division, a public office may obtain guidance from the model 1051
public records policy developed and provided to the public 1052
office by the attorney general under section 109.43 of the 1053
Revised Code. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the 1054
policy may not limit the number of public records that the 1055
public office will make available to a single person, may not 1056
limit the number of public records that it will make available 1057
during a fixed period of time, and may not establish a fixed 1058
period of time before it will respond to a request for 1059
inspection or copying of public records, unless that period is 1060
less than eight hours. 1061
The public office shall distribute the public records 1062
policy adopted by the public office under this division to the 1063
employee of the public office who is the records custodian or 1064
records manager or otherwise has custody of the records of that 1065
office. The public office shall require that employee to 1066
acknowledge receipt of the copy of the public records policy. 1067
The public office shall create a poster that describes its 1068
public records policy and shall post the poster in a conspicuous 1069
place in the public office and in all locations where the public 1070
office has branch offices. The public office may post its public 1071
records policy on the internet web site of the public office if 1072
the public office maintains an internet web site. A public 1073
office that has established a manual or handbook of its general 1074
policies and procedures for all employees of the public office 1075
shall include the public records policy of the public office in 1076
the manual or handbook. 1077

pursuant to Chapter 119. of the Revised Code to reasonably limit 1079
the number of bulk commercial special extraction requests made 1080

calendar year. The rules may include provisions for charges to 1082
be made for bulk commercial special extraction requests for the 1083
actual cost of the bureau, plus special extraction costs, plus 1084
ten per cent. The bureau may charge for expenses for redacting 1085
information, the release of which is prohibited by law. 1086
(2) As used in division (F)(1) of this section: 1087
(a) "Actual cost" means the cost of depleted supplies, 1088
records storage media costs, actual mailing and alternative 1089
delivery costs, or other transmitting costs, and any direct 1090

extracted without examination of all items in a records series, 1096
class of records, or database by a person who intends to use or 1097
forward the copies for surveys, marketing, solicitation, or 1098
resale for commercial purposes. "Bulk commercial special 1099
extraction request" does not include a request by a person who 1100
gives assurance to the bureau that the person making the request 1101
does not intend to use or forward the requested copies for 1102
surveys, marketing, solicitation, or resale for commercial 1103
purposes. 1104
(c) "Commercial" means profit-seeking production, buying, 1105
or selling of any good, service, or other product. 1106
(d) "Special extraction costs" means the cost of the time 1107

by the bureau, or the actual cost incurred to create computer 1110
programs to make the special extraction. "Special extraction 1111
costs" include any charges paid to a public agency for computer 1112
or records services. 1113
(3) For purposes of divisions (F)(1) and (2) of this 1114

commercial purposes" shall be narrowly construed and does not 1116
include reporting or gathering news, reporting or gathering 1117
information to assist citizen oversight or understanding of the 1118
operation or activities of government, or nonprofit educational 1119
research. 1120
(G) A request by a defendant, counsel of a defendant, or 1121
any agent of a defendant in a criminal action that public 1122
records related to that action be made available under this 1123
section shall be considered a demand for discovery pursuant to 1124
the Criminal Rules, except to the extent that the Criminal Rules 1125
plainly indicate a contrary intent. The defendant, counsel of 1126
the defendant, or agent of the defendant making a request under 1127
this division shall serve a copy of the request on the 1128
prosecuting attorney, director of law, or other chief legal 1129
officer responsible for prosecuting the action. 1130
(H)(1) Any portion of a body-worn camera or dashboard 1131
camera recording described in divisions (A)(17)(b) to (h) of 1132
this section may be released by consent of the subject of the 1133
recording or a representative of that person, as specified in 1134
those divisions, only if either of the following applies: 1135
(a) The recording will not be used in connection with any 1136
probable or pending criminal proceedings; 1137

H. B. No. 127 Page 40
As Introduced
(b) The recording has been used in connection with a 1138
criminal proceeding that was dismissed or for which a judgment 1139
has been entered pursuant to Rule 32 of the Rules of Criminal 1140
Procedure, and will not be used again in connection with any 1141
probable or pending criminal proceedings. 1142
(2) If a public office denies a request to release a 1143
restricted portion of a body-worn camera or dashboard camera 1144
recording, as defined in division (A)(17) of this section, any 1145
person may file a mandamus action pursuant to this section or a 1146
complaint with the clerk of the court of claims pursuant to 1147
section 2743.75 of the Revised Code, requesting the court to 1148
order the release of all or portions of the recording. If the 1149
court considering the request determines that the filing 1150
articulates by clear and convincing evidence that the public 1151
interest in the recording substantially outweighs privacy 1152
interests and other interests asserted to deny release, the 1153
court shall order the public office to release the recording. 1154
Sec. 3319.321. (A) No person shall release, or permit 1155
access to, the directory information concerning any students 1156
attending a public school to any person or group for use in a 1157
profit-making plan or activity. Notwithstanding division (B)(4) 1158
of section 149.43 of the Revised Code, a person may require 1159
disclosure of the requestor's identity or the intended use of 1160
the directory information concerning any students attending a 1161
public school to ascertain whether the directory information is 1162
for use in a profit-making plan or activity. 1163

as amended, to representatives of the armed forces, business, 1185
industry, charitable institutions, other employers, and 1186
institutions of higher education unless such any restriction is 1187
it imposes on the presentation of that information shall be 1188

such person's prior written consent, the board shall not release 1193
that information without such person's prior written consent. 1194

student or student's parent, guardian, or custodian submits to 1199
the board a written request not to release such data. Any data 1200
received by a recruiting officer shall be used solely for the 1201

the record or information in question, the keeper of the record 1250
or information shall provide access to the parent who is not the 1251
residential parent only to the extent authorized in the order. 1252
If the residential parent has presented the keeper of the record 1253

student's record shall be provided, upon request, to the law 1295
enforcement officer, if prior approval is given by the student's 1296
parent, guardian, or legal custodian. Information obtained by 1297
the officer shall be used solely in the investigation of the 1298
