person could be confident in fairness before his court. 52

Section 12:
10. Rule 2.11 of the Code requires a judge to "disqualify 53
himself or herself in any proceeding in which the judge's 54
impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including ... 55

way in the proceeding or controversy." 60

or prejudice" that would require his disqualification under Rule 62

Section 14:
2.11. His conduct casts a dark shadow of doubt over his 63
impartiality in all future cases that will come before his 64
court. 65
From these facts, the House of Representatives and the 66
Senate find that Judge Berry has violated the Ohio Code of 67
Judicial Conduct, which warrants Judge Berry's removal from 68
office under Article IV, Section 17 of the Ohio Constitution; 69
now therefore be it 70
RESOLVED, That the House of Representatives and the Senate 71
therefore summon Judge Berry to appear before the General 72
Assembly and show cause why he should not be removed from office 73
under Article IV, Section 17 of the Ohio Constitution. Within 74
