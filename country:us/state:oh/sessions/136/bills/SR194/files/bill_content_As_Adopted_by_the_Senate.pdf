parishioner of St. Patrick Bridge Avenue, and her regard for improving 24
the quality of life in our society was clearly evident in her personal 25
sacrifices of time and effort to family, friends, and community. 26
Giving generously of her time and abilities in all of her endeavors, 27
she displayed exceptional concern and insight, and her absence will be 28
keenly felt; and 29
WHEREAS, A loving sister, aunt, cousin, and friend, Mary Rose 30
Oakar always used her talents to the benefit of others, and the warmth 31
and understanding she readily extended to those around her will stand 32
as a testament to her personal character. Although the void which her 33
death has created can never be filled, the legacy of care and 34
commitment she established will surely live on; therefore be it 35
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the Senate of the 136th General 36
Assembly of Ohio, in adopting this Resolution, pay tribute to the 37
memory of a truly honorable woman, Mary Rose Oakar; and be it further 38
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit a duly 39
authenticated copy of this Resolution to the family of Mary Rose 40
Oakar. 41
