H. R. No. 13 Page 2
As Adopted by the House
Immediately upon this declaration, Britain convened a meeting of 18
the United Nations Security Council to condemn the declaration 19
as "legally invalid." United Nations Security Council Resolution 20
541 (1983) stated the "attempt to create the Turkish Republic of 21
Northern Cyprus is invalid, and will contribute to a worsening 22
of the situation in Cyprus"; now therefore be it 23
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the House of 24
Representatives of the 136th General Assembly of the State of 25
Ohio, in adopting this resolution, recognize the sovereignty of 26
the Republic of Cyprus over the entirety of the island; and be 27
it further 28
RESOLVED, That we memorialize the 50th anniversary of the 29
Turkish invasion and occupation of the northern part of the 30
island; and be it further 31
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives 32
transmit a duly authenticated copy of this resolution to the 33
Ambassador of Cyprus at the Embassy of the Republic of Cyprus in 34
the United States, to the Ohio Congressional delegation, and to 35
the news media of Ohio. 36
