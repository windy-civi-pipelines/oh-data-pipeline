and request a hearing with respect to the petition. 1189
S. B. No. 213 Page 42
As Introduced
(B) Unless the person assessed, within sixty days after 1190
service of the notice of assessment, files with the 1191
commissioner, either personally or by certified mail, a written 1192
petition signed by the person or the person's authorized agent 1193
having knowledge of the facts, the assessment becomes final, and 1194
the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the person 1195
assessed to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate 1196
the objections of the person assessed, but additional objections 1197
may be raised in writing if received by the commissioner before 1198
the date shown on the final determination. 1199
If a petition for reassessment has been properly filed, 1200
the commissioner shall proceed under section 5703.60 of the 1201
Revised Code. 1202
(C)(1) After an assessment becomes final, if any portion 1203
of the assessment, including accrued interest, remains unpaid, a 1204
certified copy of the commissioner's entry making the assessment 1205
final may be filed in the office of the clerk of the court of 1206
common pleas in the county in which the person resides or has 1207
its principal place of business in this state, or in the office 1208
of the clerk of the court of common pleas of Franklin county. 1209
(2) Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk 1210
shall enter judgment for the state against the person assessed 1211
in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment may be filed by 1212
the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for 1213
the traffic camera revenue tax" and shall have the same effect 1214
as other judgments. Execution shall issue upon the judgment at 1215
the request of the commissioner, and all laws applicable to 1216
sales on execution shall apply to sales made under the judgment. 1217
(3) If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within 1218
sixty days after the day the assessment was issued, the portion 1219
S. B. No. 213 Page 43
As Introduced
of the assessment consisting of tax due shall bear interest at 1220
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised 1221
Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until 1222
it is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for 1223
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever 1224
comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is 1225
certified to the attorney general for collection, the entire 1226
unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at the rate 1227
per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from 1228
the date of certification until the date it is paid in its 1229
entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax 1230
imposed by this chapter and may be collected by the issuance of 1231
an assessment under this section. 1232
(D) If the commissioner believes that collection of the 1233
tax imposed by this chapter will be jeopardized unless 1234
proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax is 1235
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy 1236
assessment against the person liable for the tax. Immediately 1237
upon the issuance of the jeopardy assessment, the commissioner 1238
shall file an entry with the clerk of the court of common pleas 1239
in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section. Notice 1240
of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the person 1241
assessed or the person's authorized agent in the manner provided 1242
in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code within five days of the 1243
filing of the entry with the clerk. The total amount assessed is 1244
immediately due and payable unless the person assessed files a 1245
petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of 1246
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the 1247
commissioner and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid 1248
balance of the assessment. Full or partial payment of the 1249
assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's consideration 1250
S. B. No. 213 Page 44
As Introduced
of the petition for reassessment. 1251
(E) The commissioner shall immediately forward to the 1252
treasurer of state all amounts the commissioner receives under 1253
this section, and such amounts shall be considered as revenue 1254
arising from the tax imposed under this chapter. 1255
(F) Except as otherwise provided in this division, no 1256
assessment shall be made or issued against a taxpayer for the 1257
tax imposed under this chapter more than four years after the 1258
due date for the filing of the return for the tax period for 1259
which the tax was reported, or more than four years after the 1260
return for the tax period was filed, whichever is later. The 1261
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the 1262
commissioner consent in writing to the extension or enter into 1263
an agreement waiving or extending the time limit. Any such 1264
extension shall extend the four-year time limit in division (A) 1265
of section 5755.07 of the Revised Code for the same period of 1266
time. Nothing in this division bars an assessment against a 1267
taxpayer that fails to file a return required under section 1268

Section 78:
5755.04 of the Revised Code or that files a fraudulent return. 1269
(G) If the commissioner possesses information that 1270
indicates that the amount of tax a taxpayer is required to pay 1271
under division (A) of section 5755.02 of the Revised Code 1272
exceeds the amount the taxpayer paid, the commissioner may audit 1273
a sample of the taxpayer's traffic camera revenue over a 1274
representative period of time to ascertain the amount of tax 1275
due, and may issue an assessment based on the audit. The 1276
commissioner shall make a good faith effort to reach agreement 1277
with the taxpayer in selecting a representative sample. The 1278
commissioner may apply a sampling method only if the 1279
commissioner has prescribed the method by rule. 1280

(H) If the whereabouts of a person subject to this chapter 1281
is not known to the tax commissioner, the commissioner shall 1282
follow the procedures under section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. 1283
Sec. 5755.09. If any person liable for the tax imposed 1284
under this chapter sells the trade or business, disposes in any 1285
manner other than in the regular course of business at least 1286
seventy-five per cent of assets of the trade or business, or 1287
quits the trade or business, any tax owed by such person shall 1288
become due and payable immediately, and the person shall pay the 1289
tax due under this chapter, including any applicable penalties 1290
and interest, within forty-five days after the date of selling 1291
or quitting the trade or business. The person's successor shall 1292
withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase money to cover the 1293
amount due and unpaid until the former owner produces a receipt 1294
from the tax commissioner showing that the amounts are paid or a 1295
certificate indicating that no tax is due. If a purchaser fails 1296
to withhold purchase money, that person is personally liable, up 1297
to the purchase money amount, for such amounts that are unpaid 1298
during the operation of the business by the former owner. 1299
The commissioner may adopt rules regarding the issuance of 1300
certificates under this section, including the waiver of the 1301
need for a certificate if certain criteria are met. 1302
Sec. 5755.10. If any person subject to this chapter fails 1303
to report or pay the tax as required under section 5755.04 of 1304
the Revised Code, or fails to pay any penalty imposed under this 1305
chapter within ninety days after the time prescribed for payment 1306
of the penalty, the attorney general, on the request of the tax 1307
commissioner, shall commence an action in quo warranto in the 1308
court of appeals of the county in which the person resides or 1309
has its principal place of business to forfeit and annul the 1310
S. B. No. 213 Page 46
As Introduced
person's licenses issued under Chapter 4787. of the Revised 1311
Code. If the court finds that the person is in default for the 1312
amount claimed, it shall render judgment revoking the person's 1313
registration and shall otherwise proceed as provided in Chapter 1314

Section 79:
2733. of the Revised Code. 1315
Sec. 5755.11. (A) The tax commissioner may prescribe 1316
requirements for the keeping of records and other pertinent 1317
documents, the filing of copies of federal income tax returns 1318
and determinations, and computations reconciling federal income 1319
tax returns with the returns and reports required by section 1320

Section 80:
5755.04 of the Revised Code. The commissioner may require any 1321
person, by rule or notice served on that person, to keep those 1322
records that the commissioner considers necessary to show 1323
whether, and the extent to which, a person is subject to this 1324
chapter. 1325
(B) Each taxpayer shall maintain complete and accurate 1326
records of all sales and other dispositions of traffic law 1327
photo-monitoring devices, and shall procure and retain all 1328
invoices, bills of lading, and other documents relating to the 1329
sales and other dispositions of such devices. No person shall 1330
make a false entry upon any invoice or record upon which an 1331
entry is required by this section and no person shall present 1332
any false entry for the inspection of the commissioner with the 1333
intent to evade the tax levied under this chapter. 1334
(C) The records described in divisions (A) and (B) of this 1335

Section 81:
section and other documents shall be provided to the 1336
commissioner upon request, and shall be preserved for a period 1337
of four years, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to 1338
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that 1339
they be kept for a longer period. If such records are normally 1340
S. B. No. 213 Page 47

kept by the person electronically, the person shall provide such 1341
records to the commissioner electronically at the commissioner's 1342
request. 1343
(D) Any information acquired by the commissioner under 1344
this chapter is confidential as provided for in section 5703.21 1345
of the Revised Code, except that the commissioner shall make 1346
public an electronic list of all actively registered persons 1347
required to remit the tax under this chapter, including legal 1348
names, trade names, addresses, and account numbers. In addition, 1349
the list shall include all persons that canceled their 1350
registration at any time during the preceding four calendar 1351
years, including the effective date of the cancellation. 1352
Sec. 5755.12. No person shall prepare for shipment, ship, 1353
transport, deliver, prepare for distribution, or distribute 1354
traffic law photo-monitoring devices, or otherwise engage or 1355
participate in the business of distributing traffic law photo- 1356
monitoring devices, with the intent to avoid payment of the tax 1357
levied by this chapter. 1358
Sec. 5755.13. (A) All amounts collected from the tax 1359
levied under this chapter shall be deposited into the traffic 1360
camera receipts fund, which is created in the state treasury. 1361
Investment earnings of the traffic camera receipts fund shall be 1362
credited to that fund. 1363
From the traffic camera receipts fund, the director of 1364
budget and management shall transfer as needed to the tax refund 1365
fund amounts equal to the refunds certified by the tax 1366
commissioner under section 5755.07 of the Revised Code. 1367
(B) The director shall transfer the amount remaining in 1368
the traffic camera receipts fund, after any transfers required 1369

selling, renting, providing, installing, repairing, or otherwise 1374
managing traffic law photo-monitoring devices in this state 1375
without holding a valid license issued under Chapter 4787. of 1376
the Revised Code, the tax commissioner shall impose a penalty of 1377
up to one thousand dollars. The failure to hold a valid license 1378
under Chapter 4787. of the Revised Code does not relieve such a 1379
person from the requirement to file tax returns or pay any 1380
amounts, including tax, interest, and penalties, imposed by this 1381
chapter. 1382
(B) The tax commissioner may issue an assessment against a 1383
person described in division (A) of this section for any amount 1384

fraudulent refund requested, or imprisoned not more than sixty 1390
days, or both. 1391
(B) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever 1392
knowingly violates any section of this chapter or any rule 1393
adopted by the tax commissioner under this chapter shall be 1394
fined not more than five hundred dollars, or imprisoned not more 1395
than thirty days, or both. 1396

the information provided is false, inaccurate, or incomplete, 846

filing of the entry with the clerk. The total amount assessed is 1244
immediately due and payable unless the person assessed files a 1245
petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of 1246
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the 1247
commissioner and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid 1248
balance of the assessment. Full or partial payment of the 1249
assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's consideration 1250

of the petition for reassessment. 1251
(E) The commissioner shall immediately forward to the 1252
treasurer of state all amounts the commissioner receives under 1253
this section, and such amounts shall be considered as revenue 1254
arising from the tax imposed under this chapter. 1255
(F) Except as otherwise provided in this division, no 1256
assessment shall be made or issued against a taxpayer for the 1257
tax imposed under this chapter more than four years after the 1258
due date for the filing of the return for the tax period for 1259
which the tax was reported, or more than four years after the 1260
return for the tax period was filed, whichever is later. The 1261
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the 1262
commissioner consent in writing to the extension or enter into 1263
an agreement waiving or extending the time limit. Any such 1264
extension shall extend the four-year time limit in division (A) 1265
of section 5755.07 of the Revised Code for the same period of 1266
time. Nothing in this division bars an assessment against a 1267
taxpayer that fails to file a return required under section 1268
5755.04 of the Revised Code or that files a fraudulent return. 1269
(G) If the commissioner possesses information that 1270
indicates that the amount of tax a taxpayer is required to pay 1271
under division (A) of section 5755.02 of the Revised Code 1272
exceeds the amount the taxpayer paid, the commissioner may audit 1273
a sample of the taxpayer's traffic camera revenue over a 1274
representative period of time to ascertain the amount of tax 1275
due, and may issue an assessment based on the audit. The 1276
commissioner shall make a good faith effort to reach agreement 1277
with the taxpayer in selecting a representative sample. The 1278
commissioner may apply a sampling method only if the 1279
commissioner has prescribed the method by rule. 1280

(H) If the whereabouts of a person subject to this chapter 1281
is not known to the tax commissioner, the commissioner shall 1282
follow the procedures under section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. 1283
Sec. 5755.09. If any person liable for the tax imposed 1284
under this chapter sells the trade or business, disposes in any 1285
manner other than in the regular course of business at least 1286
seventy-five per cent of assets of the trade or business, or 1287
quits the trade or business, any tax owed by such person shall 1288
become due and payable immediately, and the person shall pay the 1289
tax due under this chapter, including any applicable penalties 1290
and interest, within forty-five days after the date of selling 1291
or quitting the trade or business. The person's successor shall 1292
withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase money to cover the 1293
amount due and unpaid until the former owner produces a receipt 1294
from the tax commissioner showing that the amounts are paid or a 1295
certificate indicating that no tax is due. If a purchaser fails 1296
to withhold purchase money, that person is personally liable, up 1297
to the purchase money amount, for such amounts that are unpaid 1298
during the operation of the business by the former owner. 1299
The commissioner may adopt rules regarding the issuance of 1300
certificates under this section, including the waiver of the 1301
need for a certificate if certain criteria are met. 1302
Sec. 5755.10. If any person subject to this chapter fails 1303
to report or pay the tax as required under section 5755.04 of 1304
the Revised Code, or fails to pay any penalty imposed under this 1305
chapter within ninety days after the time prescribed for payment 1306
of the penalty, the attorney general, on the request of the tax 1307
commissioner, shall commence an action in quo warranto in the 1308
court of appeals of the county in which the person resides or 1309
has its principal place of business to forfeit and annul the 1310

S. B. No. 213 Page 46
As Introduced
person's licenses issued under Chapter 4787. of the Revised 1311
Code. If the court finds that the person is in default for the 1312
amount claimed, it shall render judgment revoking the person's 1313
registration and shall otherwise proceed as provided in Chapter 1314
2733. of the Revised Code. 1315
Sec. 5755.11. (A) The tax commissioner may prescribe 1316
requirements for the keeping of records and other pertinent 1317
documents, the filing of copies of federal income tax returns 1318
and determinations, and computations reconciling federal income 1319
tax returns with the returns and reports required by section 1320
5755.04 of the Revised Code. The commissioner may require any 1321
person, by rule or notice served on that person, to keep those 1322
records that the commissioner considers necessary to show 1323
whether, and the extent to which, a person is subject to this 1324
chapter. 1325
(B) Each taxpayer shall maintain complete and accurate 1326
records of all sales and other dispositions of traffic law 1327
photo-monitoring devices, and shall procure and retain all 1328
invoices, bills of lading, and other documents relating to the 1329
sales and other dispositions of such devices. No person shall 1330
make a false entry upon any invoice or record upon which an 1331
entry is required by this section and no person shall present 1332
any false entry for the inspection of the commissioner with the 1333
intent to evade the tax levied under this chapter. 1334
(C) The records described in divisions (A) and (B) of this 1335
section and other documents shall be provided to the 1336
commissioner upon request, and shall be preserved for a period 1337
of four years, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to 1338
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that 1339
they be kept for a longer period. If such records are normally 1340

S. B. No. 213 Page 47

kept by the person electronically, the person shall provide such 1341
records to the commissioner electronically at the commissioner's 1342
request. 1343
(D) Any information acquired by the commissioner under 1344
this chapter is confidential as provided for in section 5703.21 1345
of the Revised Code, except that the commissioner shall make 1346
public an electronic list of all actively registered persons 1347
required to remit the tax under this chapter, including legal 1348
names, trade names, addresses, and account numbers. In addition, 1349
the list shall include all persons that canceled their 1350
registration at any time during the preceding four calendar 1351
years, including the effective date of the cancellation. 1352
Sec. 5755.12. No person shall prepare for shipment, ship, 1353
transport, deliver, prepare for distribution, or distribute 1354
traffic law photo-monitoring devices, or otherwise engage or 1355
participate in the business of distributing traffic law photo- 1356
monitoring devices, with the intent to avoid payment of the tax 1357
levied by this chapter. 1358
Sec. 5755.13. (A) All amounts collected from the tax 1359
levied under this chapter shall be deposited into the traffic 1360
camera receipts fund, which is created in the state treasury. 1361
Investment earnings of the traffic camera receipts fund shall be 1362
credited to that fund. 1363
From the traffic camera receipts fund, the director of 1364
budget and management shall transfer as needed to the tax refund 1365
fund amounts equal to the refunds certified by the tax 1366
commissioner under section 5755.07 of the Revised Code. 1367
(B) The director shall transfer the amount remaining in 1368
the traffic camera receipts fund, after any transfers required 1369

under division (A) of this section, to the state post-traumatic 1370
stress disorder fund established in section 126.65 of the 1371
Revised Code. 1372
Sec. 5755.14. (A) If any person is found to be engaged in 1373
selling, renting, providing, installing, repairing, or otherwise 1374
managing traffic law photo-monitoring devices in this state 1375
without holding a valid license issued under Chapter 4787. of 1376
the Revised Code, the tax commissioner shall impose a penalty of 1377
up to one thousand dollars. The failure to hold a valid license 1378
under Chapter 4787. of the Revised Code does not relieve such a 1379
person from the requirement to file tax returns or pay any 1380
amounts, including tax, interest, and penalties, imposed by this 1381
chapter. 1382
(B) The tax commissioner may issue an assessment against a 1383
person described in division (A) of this section for any amount 1384
due under this chapter in the same manner provided under section 1385
5753.07 of the Revised Code. 1386
Sec. 5755.99. (A) Whoever knowingly files a fraudulent 1387
refund claim under section 5755.07 of the Revised Code shall be 1388
fined the greater of one thousand dollars or the amount of the 1389
fraudulent refund requested, or imprisoned not more than sixty 1390
days, or both. 1391
(B) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever 1392
knowingly violates any section of this chapter or any rule 1393
adopted by the tax commissioner under this chapter shall be 1394
fined not more than five hundred dollars, or imprisoned not more 1395
than thirty days, or both. 1396
