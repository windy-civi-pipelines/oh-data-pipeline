practice will be eliminated, it may treat the charge involved as 316
being conciliated and enter that disposition on the records of 317
the commission. If the commission fails to effect the 318
elimination of an unlawful discriminatory practice by informal 319
methods of conference, conciliation, mediation, and persuasion, 320
or by alternative dispute resolution under this section and to 321
obtain voluntary compliance with this chapter, the commission 322
