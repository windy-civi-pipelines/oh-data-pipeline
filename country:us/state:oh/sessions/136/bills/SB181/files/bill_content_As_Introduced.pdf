Sec. 1514.03. Within thirty days after each anniversary 968
date of issuance of a surface or in-stream mining permit, the 969
operator shall file with the chief of the division of mineral 970
resources management an annual report, on a form prescribed and 971
furnished by the chief, that, for the period covered by the 972
report, shall state the amount of and identify the types of 973
minerals and coal, if any coal, produced and shall state the 974
number of acres affected and the number of acres estimated to be 975
affected during the next year of operation. An annual report is 976
not required to be filed if a final report is filed in lieu 977
thereof. 978
Each annual report for a surface mining operation shall 979
include a progress map indicating the location of areas of land 980
affected during the period of the report and the location of the 981
area of land estimated to be affected during the next year. The 982
map shall be prepared in accordance with division (A)(11) or 983
(12) of section 1514.02 of the Revised Code, as appropriate, 984
except that a map prepared in accordance with division (A)(12) 985

reason to believe that the operator exceeded the boundaries of 992
the permit area or, if the operator filed the map required under 993
division (A)(11) of section 1514.02 of the Revised Code, that 994
the operator extracted ten thousand tons or more of minerals 995
during the period covered by the report. 996
Each annual report for an in-stream mining operation shall 997
include a statement of the total tonnage removed by in-stream 998
mining for each month and of the surface acreage and depth of 999
material removed by in-stream mining and shall include a map 1000
that identifies the area affected by the in-stream mining if the 1001
in-stream mining for the year addressed by the report occurred 1002
beyond the area identified in the most recent approved map, 1003
soundings that depict the cross-sectional views of the channel 1004
bottom of the watercourse if the soundings depict a cross- 1005
sectional view of the channel bottom that is different from the 1006
most recent approved map, and water elevations for the 1007
watercourse if water elevations are different from those 1008
indicated on the most recent approved map. 1009
Each annual report shall be accompanied by a filing fee in 1010
the amount of five hundred dollars, except in the case of an 1011
annual report filed by a small operator or an in-stream mining 1012
operator. A small operator, which is a surface mine operator who 1013
intends to extract fewer than ten thousand tons of minerals and 1014
no coal during the next year of operation under the permit, or 1015
an in-stream mining operator shall include a filing fee in the 1016
amount of two hundred fifty dollars with each annual report. The 1017
annual report of any operator also shall be accompanied by an 1018
acreage fee in the amount of seventy-five dollars multiplied by 1019
the number of acres estimated in the report to be affected 1020
during the next year of operation under the permit. The acreage 1021
fee shall be adjusted by subtracting a credit of seventy-five 1022

S. B. No. 181 Page 36

dollars per excess acre paid for the preceding year if the 1023
acreage paid for the preceding year exceeds the acreage actually 1024
affected or by adding an additional amount of seventy-five 1025
dollars per excess acre affected if the acreage actually 1026
affected exceeds the acreage paid for the preceding year. 1027
With each annual report the operator shall file a 1028
performance bond in the amount, unless otherwise provided by 1029
rule, of five hundred dollars multiplied by the number of acres 1030
estimated to be affected during the next year of operation under 1031
the permit for which no performance bond previously was filed. 1032
Unless otherwise provided by rule, the bond shall be adjusted by 1033
subtracting a credit of five hundred dollars per excess acre for 1034
which bond was filed for the preceding year if the acreage for 1035
which the bond was filed for the preceding year exceeds the 1036
acreage actually affected, or by adding an amount of five 1037
hundred dollars per excess acre affected if the acreage actually 1038
affected exceeds the acreage for which bond was filed for the 1039
preceding year. 1040
Within thirty days after the expiration of the surface or 1041
in-stream mining permit, or completion or abandonment of the 1042
operation, whichever occurs earlier, the operator shall submit a 1043
final report containing the same information required in an 1044
annual report, but covering the time from the last annual report 1045
to the expiration of the permit, or completion or abandonment of 1046
the operation, whichever occurs earlier. 1047
Each final report shall include a map indicating the 1048
location of the area of land affected during the period of the 1049
report and the location of the total area of land affected under 1050
the permit. The map shall be prepared in accordance with 1051
division (A)(11) or (12) of section 1514.02 of the Revised Code, 1052

S. B. No. 181 Page 37

as appropriate. 1053
In the case of a final report for an in-stream mining 1054
operation, the map also shall include the information required 1055
under division (A)(18)(A)(19) of section 1514.02 of the Revised 1056
Code, as applicable. 1057
If the final report and certified map, as verified by the 1058
chief, show that the number of acres affected under the permit 1059
is larger than the number of acres for which the operator has 1060
paid an acreage fee or filed a performance bond, upon 1061
notification by the chief, the operator shall pay an additional 1062
acreage fee in the amount of seventy-five dollars multiplied by 1063
the difference between the number of acres affected under the 1064
permit and the number of acres for which the operator has paid 1065
an acreage fee and shall file an additional performance bond in 1066
the amount, unless otherwise provided by rule, of five hundred 1067
dollars multiplied by the difference between the number of acres 1068
affected under the permit and the number of acres for which the 1069
operator has filed bond. 1070
If the final report and certified map, as verified by the 1071
chief, show that the number of acres affected under the permit 1072
is smaller than the number of acres for which the operator has 1073
filed a performance bond, the chief shall order release of the 1074
excess bond. However, the chief shall retain a performance bond 1075
in a minimum amount of ten thousand dollars irrespective of the 1076
number of acres affected under the permit. The release of the 1077
excess bond shall be in an amount, unless otherwise provided by 1078
rule, equal to five hundred dollars multiplied by the difference 1079
between the number of acres affected under the permit and the 1080
number of acres for which the operator has filed bond. 1081
The fees collected pursuant to this section and section 1082

As Introduced
1514.02 of the Revised Code shall be deposited with the 1083
treasurer of state to the credit of the mining regulation and 1084
safety fund created under section 1513.30 of the Revised Code. 1085
If upon inspection the chief finds that any filing fee, 1086
acreage fee, performance bond, or part thereof is not paid when 1087
due or is paid on the basis of false or substantially inaccurate 1088
reports, the chief may request the attorney general to recover 1089
the unpaid amounts that are due the state, and the attorney 1090
general shall commence appropriate legal proceedings to recover 1091
the unpaid amounts. 1092
Sec. 1514.04. (A) Upon receipt of notification from the 1093
chief of the division of mineral resources management of the 1094
chief's intent to issue an order granting a surface or in-stream 1095
mining permit to the applicant, the applicant shall file a 1096
surety bond, cash, an irrevocable letter of credit, or 1097
certificates of deposit in the amount, unless otherwise provided 1098
by rule, of ten thousand dollars. If the amount of land to be 1099
affected is more than twenty acres, the applicant also shall 1100
file a surety bond, cash, an irrevocable letter of credit, or 1101
certificates of deposit in the amount of five hundred dollars 1102
per acre of land to be affected that exceeds twenty acres. Upon 1103
receipt of notification from the chief of the chief's intent to 1104
issue an order granting an amendment to a surface or in-stream 1105
mining permit, the applicant shall file a surety bond, cash, an 1106
irrevocable letter of credit, or certificates of deposit in the 1107
amount required in this division. 1108
In the case of a surface mining permit, the bond shall be 1109
filed based on the number of acres estimated to be affected 1110
during the first year of operation under the permit. In the case 1111
of an amendment to a surface mining permit, the bond shall be 1112

S. B. No. 181 Page 39
As Introduced
filed based on the number of acres estimated to be affected 1113
during the balance of the period until the next anniversary date 1114
of the permit. 1115
In the case of an in-stream mining permit, the bond shall 1116
be filed based on the number of acres of land within the limits 1117
of the in-stream mining permit for the entire permit period. In 1118
the case of an amendment to an in-stream mining permit, the bond 1119
shall be filed based on the number of any additional acres of 1120
land to be affected within the limits of the in-stream mining 1121
permit. 1122
(B) A surety bond filed pursuant to this section and 1123
sections 1514.02 and 1514.03 of the Revised Code shall be upon 1124
the form that the chief prescribes and provides and shall be 1125
signed by the operator as principal and by a surety company 1126
authorized to transact business in the state as surety. The bond 1127
shall be payable to the state and shall be conditioned upon the 1128
faithful performance by the operator of all things to be done 1129
and performed by the operator as provided in this chapter and 1130
the rules and orders of the chief adopted or issued pursuant 1131
thereto. 1132
The operator may deposit with the chief, in lieu of a 1133
surety bond, cash in an amount equal to the surety bond as 1134
prescribed in this section or an irrevocable letter of credit or 1135
negotiable certificates of deposit issued by any bank organized 1136
or transacting business in this state having a cash value equal 1137
to or greater than the amount of the surety bond as prescribed 1138
in this section. Cash or certificates of deposit shall be 1139
deposited upon the same terms as the terms upon which surety 1140
bonds may be deposited. If the operator deposits cash, the cash 1141
shall be credited to the performance cash bond refunds fund 1142

created in section 1501.16 of the Revised Code. If the operator 1143
deposits certificates of deposit, the chief shall require the 1144
bank that issued any such certificate to pledge securities of a 1145
cash value equal to the amount of the certificate that is in 1146
excess of the amount insured by the federal deposit insurance 1147
corporation. The securities shall be security for the repayment 1148
of the certificate of deposit. 1149
(C) Upon a deposit of cash, a letter of credit, or 1150
certificates with the chief, the chief shall hold it in trust 1151
for the purposes for which it has been deposited. The chief 1152
shall be responsible for the safekeeping of such deposits. An 1153
operator making a deposit of cash, a letter of credit, or 1154
certificates of deposit may withdraw and receive, from the 1155
chief, all or any part of the cash, letter of credit, or 1156
certificates in the possession of the chief upon depositing with 1157
the chief an irrevocable letter of credit or negotiable 1158
certificates of deposit issued by any bank organized or 1159
transacting business in this state, equal in value to the value 1160
of the cash, letter of credit, or certificates withdrawn. An 1161
operator may demand and receive from the chief all interest or 1162
other income from any certificates as it becomes due. If 1163
certificates deposited with and in the possession of the chief 1164
mature or are called for payment by the issuer thereof, the 1165
chief, at the request of the operator who deposited them, shall 1166
convert the proceeds of the redemption or payment of the 1167
certificates into such other negotiable certificates of deposit 1168
issued by any bank organized or transacting business in this 1169
state or cash, as may be designated by the operator. 1170
(D) A governmental agency, as defined in division (A) of 1171

operator to file a surety bond, performance bond, closure bond, 1175
or any other form of financial assurance for the operation or 1176
closure of a mine or reclamation of land to be affected by a 1177
surface, underground minerals, or in-stream mining operation 1178
authorized under this chapter. 1179
(E) Except as provided in division (D) of this section, 1180
this section does not apply to any permit issued under sections 1181
1514.60 to 1514.69 of the Revised Code. However, if during the 1182
underground minerals mining operation, the land surface is 1183
affected, the chief shall require the area of the land affected 1184
to be reclaimed, and the permittee shall adhere to the bonding 1185
requirements of this section. Notwithstanding any other 1186
provision of law to the contrary, the chief shall not require a 1187
surface mining permit to be issued to an underground minerals 1188
mining permittee. 1189
Sec. 1514.05. (A) At any time within the period allowed an 1190
operator by section 1514.02 of the Revised Code to reclaim an 1191
area of land affected by surface or in-stream mining, the 1192
operator may file a request, on a form provided by the chief of 1193
the division of mineral resources management, for inspection of 1194
the area of land upon which the reclamation, other than any 1195
required planting, is completed. The request shall include all 1196
of the following: 1197
(1) The location of the area and number of acres; 1198
(2) The permit number; 1199
(3) A map showing the location of the acres reclaimed, 1200
prepared and certified in accordance with division (A)(11) or 1201
(12) of section 1514.02 of the Revised Code, as appropriate. In 1202

S. B. No. 181 Page 42
As Introduced
the case of an in-stream mining operation, the map also shall 1203
include, as applicable, the information required under division 1204
(A)(18)(A)(19) of section 1514.02 of the Revised Code. 1205
The chief shall make an inspection and evaluation of the 1206
reclamation of the area of land for which the request was 1207
submitted within ninety days after receipt of the request or, if 1208
the operator fails to complete the reclamation or file the 1209
request as required, as soon as the chief learns of the default. 1210
Thereupon, if the chief approves the reclamation, other than any 1211
required planting, as meeting the requirements of this chapter, 1212
rules adopted thereunder, any orders issued during the mining or 1213
reclamation, and the specifications of the plan for mining and 1214
reclaiming, the chief shall issue an order to the operator and 1215
the operator's surety releasing them from liability for one-half 1216
of the total amount of their surety bond on deposit to ensure 1217
reclamation for the area upon which reclamation is completed. If 1218
the operator has deposited cash, an irrevocable letter of 1219
credit, or certificates of deposit in lieu of a surety bond to 1220
ensure reclamation, the chief shall deliver to the operator or 1221
the operator's authorized agent one-half of the amount so held. 1222
If the chief does not approve the reclamation, other than 1223
any required planting, the chief shall notify the operator by 1224
certified mail. The notice shall be an order stating the reasons 1225
for unacceptability, ordering further actions to be taken, and 1226
setting a time limit for compliance. If the operator does not 1227
comply with the order within the time limit specified, the chief 1228
may order an extension of time for compliance after determining 1229
that the operator's noncompliance is for good cause, resulting 1230
from developments partially or wholly beyond the operator's 1231
control. If the operator complies within the time limit or the 1232
extension of time granted for compliance, the chief shall order 1233

S. B. No. 181 Page 43
As Introduced
release of the performance bond in the same manner as in the 1234
case of approval of reclamation, other than any required 1235
planting, by the chief, and the chief shall proceed as in that 1236
case. If the operator does not comply within the time limit and 1237
the chief does not order an extension, or if the chief orders an 1238
extension of time and the operator does not comply within the 1239
extension of time granted for compliance, the chief shall issue 1240
another order declaring that the operator has failed to reclaim 1241
and, if the operator's permit has not already expired or been 1242
revoked, revoking the operator's permit. The chief shall 1243
thereupon proceed under division (C) of this section. 1244
(B) At any time within the period allowed an operator by 1245
section 1514.02 of the Revised Code to reclaim an area affected 1246
by surface mining, the operator may file a request, on a form 1247
provided by the chief, for inspection of the area of land on 1248
which all reclamation, including the successful establishment of 1249
any required planting, is completed. The request shall include 1250
all of the following: 1251
(1) The location of the area and number of acres; 1252
(2) The permit number; 1253
(3) The type and date of any required planting of 1254
vegetative cover and the degree of success of growth; 1255
(4) A map showing the location of the acres reclaimed, 1256
prepared and certified in accordance with division (A)(11) or 1257
(12) of section 1514.02 of the Revised Code, as appropriate. In 1258
the case of an in-stream mining operation, the map also shall 1259
include the information required under division (A)(18)(A)(19) 1260
of section 1514.02 of the Revised Code. 1261
The chief shall make an inspection and evaluation of the 1262

S. B. No. 181 Page 44
As Introduced
reclamation of the area of land for which the request was 1263
submitted within ninety days after receipt of the request or, if 1264
the operator fails to complete the reclamation or file the 1265
request as required, as soon as the chief learns of the default. 1266
Thereupon, if the chief finds that the reclamation meets the 1267
requirements of this chapter, rules adopted under it, any orders 1268
issued during the mining and reclamation, and the specifications 1269
of the plan for mining and reclaiming and decides to release any 1270
remaining performance bond on deposit to ensure reclamation of 1271
the area on which reclamation is completed, within ten days of 1272
completing the inspection and evaluation, the chief shall order 1273
release of the remaining performance bond in the same manner as 1274
in the case of approval of reclamation other than required 1275
planting, and the chief shall proceed as in that case. 1276
If the chief does not approve the reclamation performed by 1277
the operator, the chief shall notify the operator by certified 1278
mail within ninety days of the filing of the application for 1279
inspection or of the date when the chief learns of the default. 1280
The notice shall be an order stating the reasons for 1281
unacceptability, ordering further actions to be taken, and 1282
setting a time limit for compliance. If the operator does not 1283
comply with the order within the time limit specified, the chief 1284
may order an extension of time for compliance after determining 1285
that the operator's noncompliance is for good cause, resulting 1286
from developments partially or wholly beyond the operator's 1287
control. If the operator complies within the time limit or the 1288
extension of time granted for compliance, the chief shall order 1289
release of the remaining performance bond in the same manner as 1290
in the case of approval of reclamation by the chief, and the 1291
chief shall proceed as in that case. If the operator does not 1292
comply within the time limit and the chief does not order an 1293

S. B. No. 181 Page 45

extension, or if the chief orders an extension of time and the 1294
operator does not comply within the extension of time granted 1295
for compliance, the chief shall issue another order declaring 1296
that the operator has failed to reclaim and, if the operator's 1297
permit has not already expired or been revoked, revoking the 1298
operator's permit. The chief then shall proceed under division 1299
(C) of this section. 1300
(C) Upon issuing an order under division (A) or (B) of 1301
this section declaring that the operator has failed to reclaim, 1302
the chief shall make a finding as to the number and location of 1303
the acres of land that the operator has failed to reclaim in the 1304
manner required by this chapter. The chief shall order the 1305
release of the performance bond in the amount of five hundred 1306
dollars per acre for those acres that the chief finds to have 1307
been reclaimed in the manner required by this chapter. The 1308
release shall be ordered in the same manner as in the case of 1309
other approval of reclamation by the chief, and the chief shall 1310
proceed as in that case. If the operator has on deposit cash, an 1311
irrevocable letter of credit, or certificates of deposit to 1312
ensure reclamation of the area of the land affected, the chief 1313
at the same time shall issue an order declaring that the 1314
remaining cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or certificates of 1315
deposit are the property of the state and are available for use 1316
by the chief in performing reclamation of the area and shall 1317
proceed in accordance with section 1514.06 of the Revised Code. 1318
If the operator has on deposit a surety bond to ensure 1319
reclamation of the area of land affected, the chief shall notify 1320
the surety in writing of the operator's default and shall 1321
request the surety to perform the surety's obligation and that 1322
of the operator. The surety, within ten days after receipt of 1323
the notice, shall notify the chief as to whether it intends to 1324

S. B. No. 181 Page 46
As Introduced
perform those obligations. 1325
If the surety chooses to perform, it shall arrange for 1326
work to begin within thirty days of the day on which it notifies 1327
the chief of its decision. If the surety completes the work as 1328
required by this chapter, the chief shall issue an order to the 1329
surety releasing the surety from liability under the bond in the 1330
same manner as if the surety were an operator proceeding under 1331
this section. If, after the surety begins the work, the chief 1332
determines that the surety is not carrying the work forward with 1333
reasonable progress, or that it is improperly performing the 1334
work, or that it has abandoned the work or otherwise failed to 1335
perform its obligation and that of the operator, the chief shall 1336
issue an order terminating the right of the surety to perform 1337
the work and demanding payment of the amount due as required by 1338
this chapter. 1339
If the surety chooses not to perform and so notifies the 1340
chief, does not respond to the chief's notice within ten days of 1341
receipt thereof, or fails to begin work within thirty days of 1342
the day it timely notifies the chief of its decision to perform 1343
its obligation and that of the operator, the chief shall issue 1344
an order terminating the right of the surety to perform the work 1345
and demanding payment of the amount due, as required by this 1346
chapter. 1347
Upon receipt of an order of the chief demanding payment of 1348
the amount due, the surety immediately shall deposit with the 1349
chief cash in the full amount due under the order for deposit 1350
with the chief. If the surety fails to make an immediate 1351
deposit, the chief shall certify it to the attorney general for 1352
collection. When the chief has issued an order terminating the 1353
right of the surety and has the cash on deposit, the cash is the 1354

property of the state and is available for use by the chief, who 1355
shall proceed in accordance with section 1514.06 of the Revised 1356
Code. 1357
Sec. 1514.07. (A) Each order of the chief of the division 1358
of mineral resources management affecting the rights, duties, or 1359
privileges of an operator or the operator's surety or of an 1360
applicant for a permit or an amendment to a permit or a plan 1361
shall be in writing and contain a finding by the chief of the 1362
facts upon which the order is based. Notice of the order shall 1363
be given by certified mail to each person whose rights, duties, 1364
or privileges are affected. 1365
(B) If the chief finds that an operator has violated any 1366
requirement of this chapter, failed to perform any measure set 1367
forth in the approved plan of mining and reclamation that is 1368
necessary to prevent damage to adjoining property or to achieve, 1369
or has otherwise failed to achieve, the performance standards of 1370
division (A)(10) of section 1514.02 of the Revised Code, the 1371
performance standards for an underground minerals mine 1372
established by the chief under rules adopted pursuant to section 1373
1514.61 of the Revised Code, or caused damage to adjoining 1374
property, the chief may issue orders directing the operator to 1375
cease violation, perform such measures, achieve such standards, 1376
or prevent or abate off-site damage. The order shall identify 1377
the operation where the violation occurs, the specific 1378
requirement violated, measure not performed, standard not 1379
achieved, or off-site damage caused, and where practicable 1380
prescribe what action the operator may take to comply with the 1381
order. The chief shall fix and set forth in the order a 1382
reasonable date or time by which the operator shall comply, and 1383
the order shall state that the chief may revoke the operator's 1384
permit if the order is not complied with by that date or time. 1385

S. B. No. 181 Page 48
As Introduced
If upon that date or time the chief finds that the operator has 1386
not complied with the order, the chief may issue an order 1387
revoking the operator's permit. 1388
(C)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the 1389
contrary, if the chief issues an order under division (B) of 1390
this section to an operator of an underground minerals mining 1391
operation to address subsidence, as defined in section 1514.60 1392
of the Revised Code, the order shall not require the operator to 1393
address, abate, repair, restore, mitigate, or remediate the 1394
subsidence on mine property unless the subsidence presents a 1395
danger to the general public or to property described in an 1396
utility easement. For subsidence occurring off of mine property, 1397
in no event shall the order require the repair, restoration, 1398
mitigation, or remediation of any buildings or structures, 1399
fixtures, or personal property. The chief shall not issue an 1400
order under division (B) of this section to an operator of an 1401
underground minerals mining operation to provide compensation to 1402
any property owner for damages allegedly caused by the 1403
underground mining operation. 1404
(2) As used in this division, "general public" means any 1405
individual who has lawful access to an area open to all members 1406
of the public. 1407
Sec. 1514.071. (A) In addition to any other penalties 1408
established under this chapter, the chief of the division of 1409
mineral resources management may assess a civil penalty against 1410
any person who fails to comply with an order issued by the chief 1411
under section 1514.07 of the Revised Code by the date specified 1412
in the order or as subsequently extended by the chief. 1413
(B) Civil penalties assessed under this section shall not 1414
exceed one thousand dollars for each occurrence of noncompliance 1415

S. B. No. 181 Page 49
As Introduced
with an order. Each day of continuing noncompliance, up to a 1416
maximum of thirty days, may be deemed a separate occurrence for 1417
purposes of penalty assessments. In determining the amount of 1418
the assessment, the chief shall consider the seriousness of the 1419
noncompliance, the effect of the noncompliance, and the 1420
operator's history of noncompliance. 1421
(C) Upon issuance of a notice of noncompliance with an 1422
order, the chief shall inform the person to whom the notice of 1423
noncompliance is issued of the amount of any civil penalty to be 1424
assessed and provide an opportunity for an adjudicatory hearing 1425
with the reclamation commission pursuant to section 1514.09 1426
1514.091 of the Revised Code. The person charged with the 1427
penalty shall have thirty days from receipt of the assessment to 1428
pay the penalty in full or, if the person wishes to contest the 1429
amount of the penalty, file a petition for review of the 1430
assessment notice of appeal with the commission pursuant to 1431
section 1514.09 1514.091 of the Revised Code and forward the 1432
amount of the penalty to the secretary of the commission as 1433
required by this division. Failure to forward the money to the 1434
secretary within thirty days after the chief informs the person 1435
of the amount of the penalty shall result in a waiver of all 1436
legal rights to contest the amount of the penalty. 1437
If, after a hearing, the commission affirms or modifies 1438
the amount of the penalty, the person charged with the penalty 1439
shall have thirty days after receipt of the written decision to 1440
file an appeal from the commission's order in accordance with 1441
section 1514.09 1514.092 of the Revised Code. 1442
At the time that the petition for review of the assessment 1443
is filed with the secretary, the person shall forward the amount 1444
of the penalty to the secretary for placement in the reclamation 1445

S. B. No. 181 Page 50
As Introduced
penalty fund created in division (F)(3) (E)(3) of section 1446
1513.02 of the Revised Code. Pursuant to administrative or 1447
judicial review of the penalty, the secretary shall do either of 1448
the following: 1449
(1) If it is determined that the amount of the penalty 1450
should be reduced, within thirty days, remit the appropriate 1451
amount of the penalty to the person, with interest, and forward 1452
any balance of the penalty, with interest, to the chief for 1453
deposit in the mining regulation and safety fund created in 1454
section 1513.30 of the Revised Code for reclamation of abandoned 1455
surface, underground minerals, or in-stream mining operations in 1456
the state; 1457
(2) If the penalty was not reduced, forward the entire 1458
penalty, with interest, to the chief for deposit in the mining 1459
regulation and safety fund for reclamation of abandoned surface, 1460
underground minerals, or in-stream mining operations in the 1461
state. 1462
(D) Civil penalties owed under this section may be 1463
recovered in a civil action brought by the attorney general upon 1464
the request of the chief. 1465
Sec. 1514.08. (A) The chief of the division of mineral 1466
resources management may adopt, amend, and rescind rules in 1467
accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code in order to 1468
prescribe procedures for submitting applications for permits, 1469
amendments to permits, and amendments to plans of mining and 1470
reclamation; filing annual reports and final reports; requesting 1471
inspection and approval of reclamation; paying permit and filing 1472
fees; and filing and obtaining the release of performance bonds 1473
deposited with the state. For the purpose of preventing damage 1474
to adjoining property or achieving one or more of the 1475

S. B. No. 181 Page 51
As Introduced
performance standards established in division (A)(10) of section 1476
1514.02 of the Revised Code, the chief may establish classes of 1477
mining industries, based upon industrial categories, 1478
combinations of minerals produced, and geological conditions in 1479
which surface or in-stream mining operations occur, and may 1480
prescribe different rules consistent with the performance 1481
standards for each class. For the purpose of apportioning the 1482
workload of the division of mineral resources management among 1483
the quarters of the year, the rules may require that 1484
applications for permits and annual reports be filed in 1485
different quarters of the year, depending upon the county in 1486
which the operation is located. 1487
(B) The chief shall adopt rules under this section that do 1488
all of the following: 1489
(1) With respect to in-stream mining, and in consultation 1490
with the chief of the division of water resources, determine 1491
periods of low flow, which are the only time periods during 1492
which in-stream mining is allowed, and develop and implement any 1493
criteria, in addition to the criteria established in section 1494
1514.02 of the Revised Code, that the chief determines are 1495
necessary for the permitting of in-stream mining; 1496
(2) Establish criteria and procedures for approving or 1497
disapproving the transfer of a surface or in-stream mining 1498
permit under division (F)(E) of section 1514.02 of the Revised 1499
Code; 1500
(3) Define when any of the following may be considered to 1501
be "significant" for purposes of section 1514.022 of the Revised 1502
Code: 1503
(a) An amendment to a permit issued under section 1514.02 1504

S. B. No. 181 Page 52
As Introduced
of the Revised Code for a surface or in-stream mining operation; 1505
(b) An amendment to the plan of mining and reclamation 1506
that must be filed with an application for either permit under 1507
section 1514.02 of the Revised Code; 1508
(c) Changes to that plan of mining and reclamation that 1509
are proposed in a permit renewal application filed under section 1510
1514.021 of the Revised Code. 1511
In defining "significant," the chief shall focus on 1512
changes that increase the likelihood that the mining operation 1513
may have a negative impact on the public. 1514
(4) Establish a framework and procedures under which the 1515
amount of any bond required to be filed under this chapter to 1516
ensure the satisfactory performance of the reclamation measures 1517
required under this chapter may be reduced by subtracting a 1518
credit based on the operator's past compliance with this chapter 1519
and rules adopted and orders issued under it. The rules also 1520
shall apply to cash, an irrevocable letter of credit, or a 1521
certificate of deposit that is on deposit in lieu of a bond. In 1522
establishing the amount of credit that an operator or applicant 1523
may receive based on past compliance, the chief may consider 1524
past compliance with respect to any permit for a surface or in- 1525
stream mining operation that has been issued in this state to 1526
the operator or applicant. 1527
(5) Establish criteria and procedures for granting a 1528
variance from compliance with the prohibitions established in 1529
divisions (E)(3) and (F)(3) of section 1514.10 of the Revised 1530
Code. The criteria shall ensure that an operator may obtain a 1531
variance only if compliance with the applicable prohibition is 1532
not necessary to prevent damage to the watercourse or 1533

S. B. No. 181 Page 53
As Introduced
surrounding areas. 1534
(6) Establish procedures and requirements governing 1535
amendments to surface, in-stream, and underground minerals 1536
mining permits in cases where land may be added to the permit; 1537
(7) Establish procedures and requirements governing permit 1538
reviews required under section 1514.021 of the Revised Code. 1539
Sec. 1514.09. The reclamation commission established 1540
pursuant to section 1513.05 of the Revised Code shall serve as 1541
the reclamation commission pursuant to this chapter. However, 1542
whenever the commission is considering any appeal pertaining to 1543
surface, underground minerals, or in-stream mining, as 1544
distinguished from coal strip mining, the member representing 1545
the coal strip mine operators shall be replaced by a person who, 1546
by reason of the person's previous vocation, employment, or 1547
affiliations, can be classed as a representative of surface, 1548
underground minerals, or in-stream mine operators, as 1549
applicable. The appointment of that person shall be made in 1550
accordance with section 1513.05 of the Revised Code, and the 1551
person's term shall be concurrent with that of the 1552
representative of the coal strip mine operators. 1553
No party to an appeal brought under this section shall be 1554
eligible for an award of attorney's fees, costs, or expenses 1555
from the commission or any court. 1556
Notwithstanding section 1513.13 of the Revised Code, an 1557
operator may appeal the determination of the chief of the 1558
division of mineral resources management that is made under 1559
division (D) of section 1514.43 of the Revised Code within ten 1560
days after the operator receives a copy of the determination. 1561
Notwithstanding section 1513.14 of the Revised Code, 1562

S. B. No. 181 Page 54
As Introduced
appeals from an order of the commission pertaining to surface or 1563
in-stream mining may be taken to the court of common pleas of 1564
the county in which the operation is located, or to the court of 1565
common pleas of Franklin county. 1566
Sec. 1514.091. (A) As used in this section, "action" 1567
includes any order or any other decision, including any 1568
modification, vacation, or termination of such an order or 1569
decision taken by the chief of the division of mineral resources 1570
management concerning a surface, in-stream, or underground 1571
minerals mining operation. 1572
(B)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any 1573
person having an interest that is or may be adversely affected 1574
by an action may initiate an appeal of the action by filing a 1575
notice of appeal with the reclamation commission within thirty 1576
days after the action is served upon the person. 1577
(2) The person shall file a copy of the notice of appeal 1578
with the chief within three days after filing the notice of 1579
appeal with the commission. Additionally, if the permit holder 1580
is not the appellant, the person shall serve a copy of the 1581
notice of appeal on the permit holder within three days after 1582
filing the notice of appeal with the commission. 1583
(3) The permit holder shall be entitled to intervene in 1584
the appeal upon filing notice of intervention with the 1585
commission within thirty days of receiving the notice under 1586
division (B)(2) of this section. Such a permit holder shall be a 1587
party to the action upon filing of the notice under this 1588
division. 1589
(4) A notice of appeal shall contain a copy of the action 1590
complained of and the grounds upon which the appeal is based. 1591

S. B. No. 181 Page 55
As Introduced
The commission has exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and 1592
decide such appeals. The filing of a notice of appeal under 1593
division (B) of this section does not operate as a stay of any 1594
action of the chief. 1595
(5) The commission shall conduct an adjudication hearing 1596
regarding each appeal. The commission shall give the applicable 1597
permittee, the chief, and any other interested persons written 1598
notice of the time and place of the hearing at least five days 1599
prior to the hearing. The hearing shall be of record. The 1600
commission shall conduct hearings and render decisions in a 1601
timely fashion. 1602
(6) Any person authorized under this section to appeal to 1603
the commission may request an informal review by the chief or 1604
the chief's designee by filing a written request with the chief 1605
within thirty days after an action is served upon the person. 1606
Filing of the written request shall toll the time for appeal 1607
before the commission, but shall not operate as a stay of any 1608
action of the chief. 1609
(C) The commission shall affirm the action of the chief 1610
unless the commission determines that it is arbitrary, 1611
capricious, or otherwise inconsistent with law. If the 1612
commission makes such a determination, the commission may modify 1613
the action or vacate and remand it to the chief for further 1614
proceedings that the commission may direct. 1615
(D)(1) The chairperson of the commission, under conditions 1616
the chairperson prescribes, may grant any temporary relief that 1617
the chairperson considers appropriate pending final 1618
determination of an appeal if all of the following conditions 1619
are met: 1620

(b) The person requesting temporary relief shows that 1625
there is a substantial likelihood that the person will prevail 1626
on the merits. 1627
(c) The relief will not adversely affect public health or 1628
safety or cause significant imminent environmental harm to land, 1629
air, or water resources. 1630
(2) The chairperson shall issue a decision regarding 1631
temporary relief expeditiously. Any party to an appeal filed 1632
with the commission who is aggrieved or adversely affected by a 1633
decision of the chairperson to grant or deny temporary relief 1634
under this section may appeal that decision to the full 1635
commission. The commission may confine its review to the record 1636
developed at the hearing before the chairperson. The party shall 1637
file the appeal with the commission within thirty days after the 1638
chairperson issues the decision on the request for temporary 1639
relief. The commission shall issue a decision as expeditiously 1640
as possible. The commission shall affirm the decision of the 1641
chairperson granting or denying temporary relief unless it 1642
determines that the decision is arbitrary, capricious, or 1643
otherwise inconsistent with law. 1644
Sec. 1514.092. (A) Any party aggrieved or adversely 1645
affected by a decision of the reclamation commission may appeal 1646
to the court of appeals of the county in which the operation 1647
that is the subject of the appeal is located, or to the court of 1648
appeals of Franklin county. The court in which the appeal is 1649
made has exclusive jurisdiction over the appeal. The party shall 1650

S. B. No. 181 Page 57

grant such temporary relief as it considers appropriate pending 1654
final disposition of the appeal if all of the following apply: 1655
(1) All parties to the appeal have been notified and given 1656
an opportunity to be heard on a request for temporary relief. 1657
(2) The person requesting the relief shows that there is a 1658
substantial likelihood that the person will prevail on the 1659
merits. 1660
(3) The relief will not adversely affect public health or 1661
safety or the health or safety of miners or cause significant 1662
imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources. 1663
The court shall affirm the decision of the commission 1664
unless the court determines that it is arbitrary, capricious, or 1665
otherwise inconsistent with law, in which case the court shall 1666
vacate the decision and remand to the commission for such 1667
further proceedings as it may direct. 1668
(B) Any order of the chief of the division of mineral 1669
resources management to adopt a rule is subject to judicial 1670
review in the Franklin county court of appeals, which court has 1671
exclusive original jurisdiction to review the order. A petition 1672
for review of the order shall be filed within thirty days from 1673
the date of such order. The petition may be made by any person 1674
who participated in the rule-making proceedings and who is 1675
aggrieved by the order. The court shall confine its review to 1676
the record of the rule-making proceedings. The order shall be 1677
affirmed unless the court concludes that the order is arbitrary, 1678
capricious, or otherwise inconsistent with law, in which case 1679

S. B. No. 181 Page 58

the court shall vacate the order or portion thereof and remand 1680
to the chief for such further proceedings as it may direct. 1681
Sec. 1514.093. (A) For the purpose of conducting any 1682
public adjudicatory hearing under this chapter, the reclamation 1683
commission or the chief may do both of the following: 1684
(1) Require the attendance of witnesses and the production 1685
of books, records, and papers; 1686
(2) At the request of any party, issue subpoenas for 1687
witnesses or subpoenas duces tecum to compel the production of 1688
any books, records, papers, or other material relevant to the 1689
inquiry, directed to the sheriff of the counties where the 1690
witnesses or materials are found. Such subpoenas shall be served 1691
and returned in the same manner as subpoenas issued by courts of 1692
common pleas are served and returned. The fees of sheriffs shall 1693
be the same as those allowed by the court of common pleas in 1694
criminal cases. 1695
(B) Witnesses shall be paid the fees and mileage provided 1696
for under section 119.094 of the Revised Code. 1697
(C) In cases of disobedience or neglect of any subpoena 1698
served on any person or the refusal of any witness to testify to 1699
any matter regarding which the witness may lawfully be 1700
interrogated, the court of common pleas of the county in which 1701
such disobedience, neglect, or refusal occurs, or any judge 1702
thereof, on application of the chief or the commission or any 1703
member thereof, shall compel obedience by attachment procedures 1704
for contempt as in the case of disobedience of the requirements 1705
of a subpoena issued from the court or a refusal to testify 1706
therein. 1707
(D) A witness at any hearing shall testify under oath or 1708

administer. 1710
(E)(1) A hearing officer may, in accordance with 1711
instructions from the commission, preside over all pre-hearing 1712
matters, including hearing and deciding all pre-trial motions. A 1713
party may, within fourteen days after receipt of the decision of 1714
a pre-trial motion, serve and file written objections to the 1715
hearing officer's decision with the secretary of the commission. 1716
Objections shall be specific and state with particularity the 1717
grounds therefor. Upon consideration of the objections, the 1718
commission may adopt, reject, or modify the decision. When the 1719
commission hears an appeal, the hearing officer shall act as the 1720
legal advisor to the commission and, at the direction of the 1721
commission, the hearing officer shall draft the decision of the 1722
commission. The hearing officer shall, at the direction of the 1723
commission, assume the duties and responsibilities of the 1724

hearing, the officer shall prepare a report setting forth the 1730
hearing officer's findings of fact and conclusions of law and a 1731
recommendation of the action to be taken by the commission. The 1732
hearing officer shall file the report with the secretary of the 1733
commission and shall mail a copy by certified mail to the 1734
