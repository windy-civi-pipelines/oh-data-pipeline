Senator Wilkin
A R E S O L U T I O N
In memory of Andrew Steven Lansing.
WHEREAS, The members of the Senate of the 136th General Assembly 1
of Ohio wish to offer our deepest sympathy and heartfelt condolences 2
to the family and many friends of Andrew Steven Lansing on the 3
sorrowful occasion of his death; and 4
WHEREAS, Andy Lansing left an indelible impression on the people 5
whose lives he touched, and he will long be remembered as a spirited 6
individual who contributed immeasurably to the world around him. A 7
veteran of the U.S. Army, he worked at the Ohio Department of 8
Rehabilitation and Correction for more than twenty-four years, most 9
recently as an officer at Ross Correctional Institute, and he was 10
widely respected for his willingness to serve in a variety of 11
capacities, including as a member of the Special Response Team. 12
Clearly, he demonstrated an unwavering commitment to his profession, 13
and his absence will be keenly felt; and 14
WHEREAS, Giving generously of his energy and abilities, Andy 15
Lansing displayed exceptional concern and insight and was tireless in 16
his work. Indeed, he always used his talents to the benefit of those 17
around him, including his wife, Chun, his two children, Kimberly and 18
Edward, and his many siblings, nieces, and nephews, and although the 19
void his death has created can never be filled, the legacy of care and 20
commitment he established will surely live on; and 21
WHEREAS, Andy Lansing’s concern for improving the quality of life 22
in our society was clearly evident in the contributions he made to his 23
community. Among his endeavors, he was a member of Orient Lodge 321 of 24
the Free and Accepted Masons and the Pike County Shrine Club, and the 25
warmth and understanding that he so readily extended to others will 26
stand as a monument to his personal character; therefore be it 27
