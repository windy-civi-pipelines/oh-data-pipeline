WHEREAS, Designated by Senate Bill 21 of the 136th General 4

illustrious figures in our state’s history. Indeed, it is fitting that 7
this year’s event, which coincides with the two hundred third 8

remarkable individual, and he combined civic concern and dedication 11

attorney in private practice and a staunch abolitionist who defended 13
refugee slaves, he served in the Union Army during the Civil War, 14
where he attained the rank of Major General, and he served three terms 15
as governor of Ohio and as a member of the House of Representatives 16
before being elected the 19th President of the United States; and 17
WHEREAS, Rutherford B. Hayes left an indelible mark upon the 18
history of our state and nation, and all those who have organized 19
commemorative events to mark his Two Hundred Third birthday, including 20
the members of the Rutherford B. Hayes Heritage Society, are deserving 21
of high praise. Indeed, they are to be commended for their tremendous 22
efforts to guarantee that the past will not be forgotten, and their 23
actions demonstrate the potential of every individual to have a 24
positive effect on the quality of life in our society; therefore be it 25
