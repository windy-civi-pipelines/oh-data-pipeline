towards a person in a school safety zone, the court shall impose 1377
upon the offender an additional prison term of two years. The 1378
offender shall serve the additional two years consecutively to 1379
and prior to the prison term imposed for the underlying offense. 1380
(2)(a) If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to 1381
a felony violation of section 2907.22, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 1382
2907.25 of the Revised Code and to a specification of the type 1383
described in section 2941.1421 of the Revised Code and if the 1384
court imposes a prison term on the offender for the felony 1385
violation, the court may impose upon the offender an additional 1386
prison term as follows: 1387
(i) Subject to division (H)(2)(a)(ii) of this section, an 1388
additional prison term of one, two, three, four, five, or six 1389
months; 1390
(ii) If the offender previously has been convicted of or 1391
pleaded guilty to one or more felony or misdemeanor violations 1392
of section 2907.22, 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25 of 1393

As Introduced
the Revised Code and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to 1394
a specification of the type described in section 2941.1421 of 1395
the Revised Code regarding one or more of those violations, an 1396
additional prison term of one, two, three, four, five, six, 1397
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, or twelve months. 1398
(b) In lieu of imposing an additional prison term under 1399
division (H)(2)(a) of this section, the court may directly 1400
impose on the offender a sanction that requires the offender to 1401
wear a real-time processing, continual tracking electronic 1402
monitoring device during the period of time specified by the 1403
court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal the 1404
duration of an additional prison term that the court could have 1405
imposed upon the offender under division (H)(2)(a) of this 1406
section. A sanction imposed under this division shall commence 1407
on the date specified by the court, provided that the sanction 1408
shall not commence until after the offender has served the 1409
prison term imposed for the felony violation of section 2907.22, 1410
2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25 of the Revised Code and any 1411
residential sanction imposed for the violation under section 1412
2929.16 of the Revised Code. A sanction imposed under this 1413
division shall be considered to be a community control sanction 1414
for purposes of section 2929.15 of the Revised Code, and all 1415
provisions of the Revised Code that pertain to community control 1416
sanctions shall apply to a sanction imposed under this division, 1417
except to the extent that they would by their nature be clearly 1418
inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs associated with a 1419
sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of the 1420
use of the monitoring device. 1421
(I) At the time of sentencing, the court may recommend the 1422
offender for placement in a program of shock incarceration under 1423
section 5120.031 of the Revised Code or for placement in an 1424

H. B. No. 487 Page 49
As Introduced
intensive program prison under section 5120.032 of the Revised 1425
Code, disapprove placement of the offender in a program of shock 1426
incarceration or an intensive program prison of that nature, or 1427
make no recommendation on placement of the offender. In no case 1428
shall the department of rehabilitation and correction place the 1429
offender in a program or prison of that nature unless the 1430
department determines as specified in section 5120.031 or 1431
5120.032 of the Revised Code, whichever is applicable, that the 1432
offender is eligible for the placement. 1433
If the court disapproves placement of the offender in a 1434
program or prison of that nature, the department of 1435
rehabilitation and correction shall not place the offender in 1436
any program of shock incarceration or intensive program prison. 1437
If the court recommends placement of the offender in a 1438
program of shock incarceration or in an intensive program 1439
prison, and if the offender is subsequently placed in the 1440
recommended program or prison, the department shall notify the 1441
court of the placement and shall include with the notice a brief 1442
description of the placement. 1443
If the court recommends placement of the offender in a 1444
program of shock incarceration or in an intensive program prison 1445
and the department does not subsequently place the offender in 1446
the recommended program or prison, the department shall send a 1447
notice to the court indicating why the offender was not placed 1448
in the recommended program or prison. 1449
If the court does not make a recommendation under this 1450
division with respect to an offender and if the department 1451
determines as specified in section 5120.031 or 5120.032 of the 1452
Revised Code, whichever is applicable, that the offender is 1453
eligible for placement in a program or prison of that nature, 1454

H. B. No. 487 Page 50
As Introduced
the department shall screen the offender and determine if there 1455
is an available program of shock incarceration or an intensive 1456
program prison for which the offender is suited. If there is an 1457
available program of shock incarceration or an intensive program 1458
prison for which the offender is suited, the department shall 1459
notify the court of the proposed placement of the offender as 1460
specified in section 5120.031 or 5120.032 of the Revised Code 1461
and shall include with the notice a brief description of the 1462
placement. The court shall have ten days from receipt of the 1463
notice to disapprove the placement. 1464
(J) If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to 1465
aggravated vehicular homicide in violation of division (A)(1) of 1466
section 2903.06 of the Revised Code and division (B)(2)(c) or 1467
(d) of that section applies, the person shall be sentenced 1468
pursuant to section 2929.142 of the Revised Code. 1469
(K)(1) The court shall impose an additional mandatory 1470
prison term of two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 1471
ten, or eleven years on an offender who is convicted of or 1472
pleads guilty to a violent felony offense if the offender also 1473
is convicted of or pleads guilty to a specification of the type 1474
described in section 2941.1424 of the Revised Code that charges 1475
that the offender is a violent career criminal and had a firearm 1476
on or about the offender's person or under the offender's 1477
control while committing the presently charged violent felony 1478
offense and displayed or brandished the firearm, indicated that 1479
the offender possessed a firearm, or used the firearm to 1480
facilitate the offense. The offender shall serve the prison term 1481
imposed under this division consecutively to and prior to the 1482
prison term imposed for the underlying offense. The prison term 1483
shall not be reduced pursuant to section 2929.20, division (A) 1484
(2) or (3) of section 2967.193 or 2967.194, or any other 1485

H. B. No. 487 Page 51

provision of Chapter 2967. or 5120. of the Revised Code. A court 1486
may not impose more than one sentence under division (B)(2)(a) 1487
of this section and this division for acts committed as part of 1488
the same act or transaction. 1489
(2) As used in division (K)(1) of this section, "violent 1490
career criminal" and "violent felony offense" have the same 1491
meanings as in section 2923.132 of the Revised Code. 1492
(L) If an offender receives or received a sentence of life 1493
imprisonment without parole, a sentence of life imprisonment, a 1494
definite sentence, or a sentence to an indefinite prison term 1495
under this chapter for a felony offense that was committed when 1496
the offender was under eighteen years of age, the offender's 1497
parole eligibility shall be determined under section 2967.132 of 1498
the Revised Code. 1499
Sec. 2941.1427. (A) Imposition of a one, two, three, four , 1500
five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten-year mandatory prison term 1501
upon an offender pursuant to division (B)(12) of section 2929.14 1502
of the Revised Code, pursuant to determination by a court that 1503
an offender is a repeat drug offender, is precluded unless the 1504
indictment, count in the indictment, or information charging the 1505
offender specifies that the offender is a repeat drug offender. 1506
The specification shall be stated at the end of the body of the 1507
indictment, count, or information, and shall be stated in 1508
substantially the following form: 1509
"SPECIFICATION (or, SPECIFICATION TO THE FIRST COUNT). The 1510
Grand Jurors (or insert the person's or prosecuting attorney's 1511
name when appropriate) further find and specify that (set forth 1512
that the offender is a repeat drug offender)." 1513
(B) The court shall determine the issue of whether an 1514

H. B. No. 487 Page 52
As Introduced
offender is a repeat drug offender. 1515
(C) At the arraignment of the defendant or as soon 1516
thereafter as is practicable, the prosecuting attorney may give 1517
notice to the defendant of the prosecuting attorney's intention 1518
to use a certified copy of the entry of judgment of a prior 1519
conviction as proof of that prior conviction. The defendant must 1520
then give notice to the prosecuting attorney of the defendant's 1521
intention to object to the use of the entry of judgment. If the 1522
defendant pursuant to Criminal Rule 12 does not give notice of 1523
that intention to the prosecuting attorney before trial, the 1524
defendant waives the objection to the use of an entry of 1525
judgment as proof of the defendant's prior conviction, as shown 1526
on the entry of judgment. 1527
(D) As used in this section, "repeat drug offender" has 1528
the same meaning as in section 2929.01 of the Revised Code. 1529
Section 2. That existing sections 2929.01 and 2929.14 of 1530
the Revised Code are hereby repealed. 1531
Section 3. Section 2929.14 of the Revised Code is 1532
presented in this act as a composite of the section as amended 1533
by H.B. 37, H.B. 56, H.B. 111, and S.B. 106, all of the 135th 1534
General Assembly. The General Assembly, applying the principle 1535
stated in division (B) of section 1.52 of the Revised Code that 1536
amendments are to be harmonized if reasonably capable of 1537
simultaneous operation, finds that the composite is the 1538
resulting version of the section in effect prior to the 1539
effective date of the section as presented in this act. 1540
