drug for that patient or that patient's condition, then after 84
explaining and discussing the objection with the prescriber, the 85
pharmacist, hospital, inpatient facility, or pharmacy shall be 86

modification or discontinuation; 140
(b) The patient or the patient's personal representative 141
requests in writing to discontinue the drug or consents to the 142

for off-label use, the decision to continue the use of the drug 153

representative after discussing the risks and benefits of 155
continuing the drug with the in-house prescriber and the other 156
medical staff involved in the patient's care and giving informed 157
consent. 158
(6) When a hospital or inpatient facility patient or a 159
H. B. No. 12 Page 7
As Introduced
patient's personal representative wishes to try a drug to treat 160
a patient's condition, but there is no in-house prescriber 161
willing to prescribe the drug, the hospital or inpatient 162
facility shall not obstruct or intentionally delay the transfer 163
of that patient to another hospital, inpatient facility, or 164
hospice that is willing to accept and treat the patient, nor 165
shall the hospital or inpatient facility prevent the patient's 166
discharge if that is the wish of the patient or the patient's 167
personal representative. 168
(7) Nothing in this section prevents a pharmacist from 169
discussing a prescription or expressing any dosage 170

health-related licensing board, the department of health, or 193
another state agency responsible for the licensure or regulation 194

consider the action of prescribing, dispensing, or administering 196
a drug to a consenting patient or with the informed consent of 197
the patient's personal representative, including for off-label 198
use, by a prescriber, pharmacist, hospital, inpatient facility, 199
or pharmacy under this section to be unlawful, unethical, 200
unauthorized, or unprofessional conduct and shall not pursue 201
professional discipline or fines or other regulatory sanctions 202
against the prescriber, pharmacist, hospital, facility, or 203
pharmacy except in cases where prescribing, dispensing, or 204
administering the drug to that patient was done with 205
recklessness or gross negligence. The prescriber is not immune 206
from civil liability if harm comes to the patient. 207
(F) Free speech is a protected right under the United 208
States and Ohio Constitutions. Health care professionals are not 209
exempt from constitutional protections. A health-related 210
licensing board, the department of health, or other state agency 211
responsible for the licensure or regulation of health care 212
professionals shall neither infringe on free speech nor pursue 213
or threaten to pursue professional discipline or fines or other 214
regulatory sanctions against a prescriber, pharmacist, or other 215
licensed health care professional for publicly or privately 216
expressing an opinion regarding the safety, risks, benefits, or 217
efficacy of a drug or other medical intervention because that 218
opinion does not align with the opinions of the board, 219
department, other state agency, a board of health of a city or 220
