appears that two-thirds of the appraised value, as established 448

if a private selling officer has been ordered to sell the lands 574
and tenements, the private selling officer shall give the public 575
notice described in division (A)(2)(a) of this section in the 576
newspaper designated by the court. If the court has not 577

designated by the county sheriff, except that the online notices 580
required by that division may be posted to the private selling 581
officer's web site, or a web site maintained by the private 582
selling officer for those purposes, rather than the sheriff's 583
web site, or a web site maintained by the sheriff for those 584
purposes. No sale that otherwise complies with division (A)(2) 585
of this section shall be invalid. 586
(B) Any officer taking lands and tenements in execution 587
that are advertised and offered for sale but unsold for want of 588
bidders may advertise any subsequent sale in any method the 589
officer finds suitable, which may include online advertisement 590
instead of print. Any such advertisement of a subsequent sale 591
shall be deemed to meet the notice requirement in division (A) 592
of this section. 593
(C)(1) A sheriff or private selling officer shall not 594
charge or include as an expense of the sale any amount for 595
publishing notice on the sheriff's or private selling officer's 596
web site or a web site maintained by the sheriff or private 597
selling officer for those purposes. 598
(2) If the court ordering the sale designates the 599
newspaper in which the public notice is to be published, and the 600

reasonable efforts, is unable to find a newspaper of general 606
circulation in the county that will publish notice of the sale, 607
subject to division (C)(1) of this section, the sheriff or 608

Sec. 2329.27. (A) When the public notice required by 619
division (A)(2) of section 2329.26 of the Revised Code is made 620
in a newspaper published weekly, it is sufficient to insert it 621
for three consecutive weeks. If both a daily and weekly edition 622
of the paper are published and the circulation of the daily in 623
the county exceeds that of the weekly in the county, or if the 624
lands and tenements taken in execution are situated in a city, 625
both a daily and weekly edition of the paper are published, and 626
the circulation of the daily in that city exceeds the 627
circulation of the weekly in that city, it is sufficient to 628
publish the public notice in the daily once a week for three 629
consecutive weeks before the day of sale, each insertion to be 630
on the same day of the week. The expense of that publication in 631
a daily shall not exceed the cost of publishing it in a weekly. 632

(B)(1) Subject Except as provided in division (B) of 633
section 2329.26 of the Revised Code and subject to divisions (B) 634
(2) (B) and (3) (C) of this section, all sales of lands and 635
tenements taken in execution that are made without compliance 636
with the written notice requirements of division (A)(1)(a) of 637
section 2329.26 of the Revised Code, the public notice 638
requirements of division (A)(2) of that section, and the notice 639
requirements of section 2329.261 of the Revised Code, the 640
purchaser information requirements of section 2329.271 of the 641
Revised Code, and division (A) of this section shall be set 642
aside, on motion by any interested party, by the court to which 643
the execution is returnable. 644
(2) (B) Proof of service endorsed upon a copy of the 645
written notice required by division (A)(1)(a) of section 2329.26 646
of the Revised Code shall be conclusive evidence of the service 647
of the written notice in compliance with the requirements of 648
that division, unless a party files a motion to set aside the 649
sale of the lands and tenements pursuant to division (B)(1) (A) 650
of this section and establishes by a preponderance of the 651
evidence that the proof of service is fraudulent. 652
(3) (C) If the court to which the execution is returnable 653
enters its order confirming the sale of the lands and tenements, 654
the order shall have both of the following effects: 655
(a) (1) The order shall be deemed to constitute a judicial 656
finding as follows: 657
(i) (a) That the sale of the lands and tenements complied 658
with the written notice requirements of division (A)(1)(a) of 659
section 2329.26 of the Revised Code and the public notice 660
requirements of division (A)(2) of that section, and section 661
2329.261 of the Revised Code, and division (A) of this section, 662

or that compliance of that nature did not occur but the failure 663
to give a written notice to a party entitled to notice under 664
division (A)(1)(a) of section 2329.26 of the Revised Code has 665
not prejudiced that party; 666
(ii) (b) That all parties entitled to notice under 667
division (A)(1)(a) of section 2329.26 of the Revised Code 668
received adequate notice of the date, time, and place of the 669
sale of the lands and tenements; 670
(iii) (c) That the purchaser has submitted the contact 671
information required by section 2329.271 of the Revised Code. 672
(b) (2) The order bars the filing of any further motions 673
to set aside the sale of the lands and tenements. 674
Sec. 2329.312. (A) All levying officers appointed or 675
authorized by a court under this chapter to conduct the judicial 676
or execution sale of residential property consisting of one to 677
four single-family units shall submit quarterly reports to the 678
attorney general. The reports shall include data on each such 679
sale conducted by the officer, including data showing whether or 680
not the deadlines required under division (E) of section 681
2308.02, division (B) of section 2329.17, and sections 2329.30 682
and 2329.31 of the Revised Code are met. 683
(B) The attorney general shall make the information 684
included in the reports described in division (A) of this 685
section publicly available. 686
Sec. 2329.52. (A) Except as otherwise provided in division 687
(B) of this section, when premises are ordered to be sold, if 688
said premises, or a part thereof, remain unsold for want of 689
bidders after having been once appraised, advertised, and 690
offered for sale, the court from which the order of sale issued 691

may, on motion of the plaintiff or defendant and from time to 692
time until said premises are disposed of, order a new 693
appraisement and sale or direct the amount for which said 694
premises, or a part thereof, may be sold. 695
The court may order that the premises be sold as follows: 696
One third cash in hand, one third in nine months from the day of 697
sale, and the remaining one third in eighteen months from the 698
day of sale, the deferred payments to draw interest at six per 699
cent and be secured by a mortgage on the premises. 700
(B)(1) When a residential property is ordered to be sold 701
pursuant to a residential mortgage loan foreclosure action, if 702
the property remains unsold after the first auction, then a 703
second subsequent auction shall be held and the property shall 704
be sold to the highest bidder without regard to the minimum bid 705
requirement in section 2329.20 of the Revised Code, but subject 706
to section 2329.21 of the Revised Code relating to costs, 707
allowances, and real estate taxes, or disposed of in any other 708
manner pursuant to this chapter. This second Any subsequent 709
auction shall be held not earlier than seven three days and not 710
later than thirty days after the first previous auction sale 711
date. A residential property that remains unsold after two 712
auctions may be subsequently offered for sale without regard to 713
the minimum bid requirement in section 2329.20 of the Revised 714
Code, but subject to section 2329.21 of the Revised Code 715
relating to costs, allowances, and real estate taxes, or 716
disposed of in any other manner pursuant to this chapter or any 717
other provision of the Revised Code. 718
