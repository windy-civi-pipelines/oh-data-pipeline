aviation of the division of multi-modal planning and programs of 923
the department of transportation and for which not less than 924
seventy per cent of the area shown by such designs and plans to 925
constitute the total area has been acquired. An airport is 926
"publicly owned" if the portion thereof used for the landing and 927

to minimize injury, loss of life, and hazards to the safety of 994
persons or to the security of property within such zones, and 995
