imposed by the court, agreeing to pay any fee imposed by the 203
court for the costs of the house arrest with electronic 204

the child if the child violates any of the requirements of the 208
dispositional order of house arrest with electronic monitoring. 209

committing an act that if committed by an adult would be a drug 285
abuse offense or for violating division (B) of section 2917.11 286

court, in its discretion, may terminate the suspension if the 289
child attends and satisfactorily completes a drug abuse or 290
alcohol abuse education, intervention, or treatment program 291
specified by the court. During the time the child is attending a 292
program described in this division, the court shall retain the 293
child's temporary instruction permit, probationary driver's 294
license, or driver's license, and the court shall return the 295

(C) The court may establish a victim-offender mediation 298
program in which victims and their offenders meet to discuss the 299

the assent of the victim of the delinquent act committed by the 301
child, the court may require the child to participate in the 302
program. 303
(D)(1) If a child is adjudicated a delinquent child for 304
committing an act that would be a felony if committed by an 305
adult and if the child caused, attempted to cause, threatened to 306

act, the court, prior to issuing an order of disposition under 308
this section, shall order the preparation of a victim impact 309
statement by the probation department of the county in which the 310
victim of the act resides, by the court's own probation 311
department, or by a victim assistance program that is operated 312

H. B. No. 518 Page 12
As Introduced
by the state, a county, a municipal corporation, or another 313
governmental entity. The court shall consider the victim impact 314
statement in determining the order of disposition to issue for 315
the child. 316
(2) Each victim impact statement shall identify the victim 317
of the act for which the child was adjudicated a delinquent 318
child, itemize any economic loss suffered by the victim as a 319
result of the act, identify any physical injury suffered by the 320
victim as a result of the act and the seriousness and permanence 321
of the injury, identify any change in the victim's personal 322
welfare or familial relationships as a result of the act and any 323
psychological impact experienced by the victim or the victim's 324
family as a result of the act, and contain any other information 325
related to the impact of the act upon the victim that the court 326
requires. 327
(3) A victim impact statement shall be kept confidential 328
and is not a public record. However, the court may furnish 329
copies of the statement to the department of youth services if 330
the delinquent child is committed to the department or to both 331
the adjudicated delinquent child or the adjudicated delinquent 332
child's counsel and the prosecuting attorney. The copy of a 333
victim impact statement furnished by the court to the department 334
pursuant to this section shall be kept confidential and is not a 335
public record. If an officer is preparing pursuant to section 336
2947.06 or 2951.03 of the Revised Code or Criminal Rule 32.2 a 337
presentence investigation report pertaining to a person, the 338
court shall make available to the officer, for use in preparing 339
the report, a copy of any victim impact statement regarding that 340
person. The copies of a victim impact statement that are made 341
available to the adjudicated delinquent child or the adjudicated 342
delinquent child's counsel and the prosecuting attorney pursuant 343

H. B. No. 518 Page 13

probation departments and victim assistance programs to develop 354
a standard victim impact statement. 355
(E)(1) If a child is adjudicated a delinquent child for 356
violating a court order regarding the child's prior adjudication 357
as an unruly child for being a habitual truant and the court 358
determines that the parent, guardian, or other person having 359
care of the child has failed to cause the child's attendance at 360
school in violation of section 3321.38 of the Revised Code, in 361
addition to any order of disposition it makes under this 362
section, the court shall warn the parent, guardian, or other 363
person having care of the child that any subsequent adjudication 364
with regard to truancy may result in a criminal charge against 365
the parent, guardian, or other person having care of the child 366
