Section 18:
section applies only to the taxable year for which the election 229
is made by the pass-through entity. Unless the tax commissioner 230
provides otherwise, this election, once made, is binding and 231
irrevocable for the taxable year for which the election is made. 232
Nothing in this division shall be construed to provide for any 233
deduction or credit that would not be allowable if a nonresident 234
pass-through entity investor were to file an annual return. 235
(4) If a pass-through entity makes the election provided 236
for under division (D) of this section, the pass-through entity 237
shall be liable for any additional taxes, interest, interest 238
penalty, or penalties imposed by this chapter if the tax 239
commissioner finds that the single return does not reflect the 240
correct tax due by the pass-through entity investors covered by 241
that return. Nothing in this division shall be construed to 242
limit or alter the liability, if any, imposed on pass-through 243
entity investors for unpaid or underpaid taxes, interest, 244
interest penalty, or penalties as a result of the pass-through 245

As Introduced
"correct tax due" means the tax that would have been paid by the 248
pass-through entity had the single return been filed in a manner 249
reflecting the commissioner's findings. Nothing in division (D) 250
of this section shall be construed to make or hold a pass- 251
through entity liable for tax attributable to a pass-through 252
entity investor's income from a source other than the pass- 253
through entity electing to file the single return. 254
(E) If a husband and wife file a joint federal income tax 255
return for a taxable year, they shall file a joint return under 256
this section for that taxable year, and their liabilities are 257
joint and several, but, if the federal income tax liability of 258
either spouse is determined on a separate federal income tax 259
return, they shall file separate returns under this section. 260
If either spouse is not required to file a federal income 261
tax return and either or both are required to file a return 262
pursuant to this chapter, they may elect to file separate or 263
joint returns, and, pursuant to that election, their liabilities 264
are separate or joint and several. If a husband and wife file 265
separate returns pursuant to this chapter, each must claim the 266
taxpayer's own exemption, but not both, as authorized under 267

Section 19:
section 5747.02 of the Revised Code on the taxpayer's own 268
return. 269
(F) Each return or notice required to be filed under this 270

declaration under the penalties of perjury. The tax commissioner 275
shall prescribe the form that the signature and declaration 276
shall take. 277

section shall be made and filed as required by section 5747.04 279
of the Revised Code, on or before the fifteenth day of April of 280
each year, on forms that the tax commissioner shall prescribe, 281
together with remittance made payable to the treasurer of state 282
in the combined amount of the state and all school district 283
income taxes shown to be due on the form. 284
Upon good cause shown, the commissioner may extend the 285
period for filing any notice or return required to be filed 286
under this section and may adopt rules relating to extensions. 287
If the extension results in an extension of time for the payment 288
of any state or school district income tax liability with 289
respect to which the return is filed, the taxpayer shall pay at 290
the time the tax liability is paid an amount of interest 291
computed at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of 292
the Revised Code on that liability from the time that payment is 293
due without extension to the time of actual payment. Except as 294
provided in section 5747.132 of the Revised Code, in addition to 295
all other interest charges and penalties, all taxes imposed 296
under this chapter or Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code and 297
remaining unpaid after they become due, except combined amounts 298
due of one dollar or less, bear interest at the rate per annum 299
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code until paid or 300
until the day an assessment is issued under section 5747.13 of 301
the Revised Code, whichever occurs first. 302
If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to 303
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by section 5747.02 of the 304
Revised Code or any tax imposed under Chapter 5748. of the 305
Revised Code, the commissioner may require returns and payments 306
to be made otherwise than as provided in this section. 307

To the extent that any provision in this division 308
conflicts with any provision in section 5747.026 of the Revised 309
Code, the provision in that section prevails. 310

Section 22:
5747.062, 5747.063, 5747.064, 5747.065, or 5747.071 of the 312
Revised Code shall be allowed to the ultimate recipient of the 313
income as credits against payment of the appropriate taxes 314
imposed on the ultimate recipient by section 5747.02 and under 315
Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code. As used in this division, 316

Section 23:

the Revised Code on the annual return required to be filed under 320
this section. 321
(I) If a pass-through entity elects to file a single 322
return under division (D) of this section and if any investor is 323
required to file the annual return and make the payment of taxes 324
required by this chapter on account of the investor's other 325
income that is not included in a single return filed by a pass- 326
through entity or any other investor elects to file the annual 327
return, the investor is entitled to a refundable credit equal to 328
the investor's proportionate share of the tax paid by the pass- 329
through entity on behalf of the investor. The investor shall 330
claim the credit for the investor's taxable year in which or 331
with which ends the taxable year of the pass-through entity. 332
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow any credit 333
provided in this chapter to be claimed more than once. For the 334
purpose of computing any interest, penalty, or interest penalty, 335
the investor shall be deemed to have paid the refundable credit 336
provided by this division on the day that the pass-through 337
entity paid the estimated tax or the tax giving rise to the 338
S. B. No. 205 Page 13

credit. 339
(J) The tax commissioner shall ensure that each return 340
required to be filed under this section includes a box that the 341
taxpayer may check to authorize a paid tax preparer who prepared 342
the return to communicate with the department of taxation about 343
matters pertaining to the return. The return or instructions 344
accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box 345
the taxpayer authorizes the department of taxation to contact 346
the preparer concerning questions that arise during the 347
processing of the return and authorizes the preparer only to 348
provide the department with information that is missing from the 349
return, to contact the department for information about the 350
processing of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund 351
or payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical 352
errors, offsets, or return preparation that the taxpayer has 353
received from the department and has shown to the preparer. 354
(K) The tax commissioner shall permit individual taxpayers 355
to instruct the department of taxation to cause any refund of 356
overpaid taxes to be deposited directly into a checking account, 357
savings account, or an individual retirement account or 358
individual retirement annuity, or preexisting college savings 359
plan or program account offered by the Ohio tuition trust 360
authority under Chapter 3334. of the Revised Code, as designated 361
by the taxpayer, when the taxpayer files the annual return 362
required by this section electronically. 363

is the owner of an electing pass-through entity, as defined in 365

Section 24:

under section 5733.06 of the Revised Code. 164

single return any investor that is itself a pass-through entity 166

interest penalty required by this section or section 5747.02, 174
5747.09, or 5747.15 of the Revised Code. Nothing in division (D) 175
of this section precludes such an investor from filing the 176
annual return under this section, utilizing the refundable 177
credit equal to the investor's proportionate share of the tax 178
paid by the pass-through entity on behalf of the investor under 179
division (I) of this section, and making the payment of taxes 180
imposed under section 5747.02 of the Revised Code. Nothing in 181
division (D) of this section shall be construed to provide to 182
such an investor or pass-through entity any additional deduction 183
or credit, other than the credit provided by division (I) of 184
this section, solely on account of the entity's filing a return 185
in accordance with this section. Such a pass-through entity also 186
shall make the filing and payment of estimated taxes on behalf 187
of the pass-through entity investors other than an investor that 188

Revised Code; 221
(o) The credit for education expenses under section 222
5747.72 of the Revised Code; 223

(q) The credit for family caregivers under section 226

(3) The election provided for under division (D) of this 228
section applies only to the taxable year for which the election 229
is made by the pass-through entity. Unless the tax commissioner 230
provides otherwise, this election, once made, is binding and 231
irrevocable for the taxable year for which the election is made. 232
Nothing in this division shall be construed to provide for any 233
deduction or credit that would not be allowable if a nonresident 234
pass-through entity investor were to file an annual return. 235
(4) If a pass-through entity makes the election provided 236
for under division (D) of this section, the pass-through entity 237
shall be liable for any additional taxes, interest, interest 238
penalty, or penalties imposed by this chapter if the tax 239
commissioner finds that the single return does not reflect the 240
correct tax due by the pass-through entity investors covered by 241
that return. Nothing in this division shall be construed to 242
limit or alter the liability, if any, imposed on pass-through 243
entity investors for unpaid or underpaid taxes, interest, 244
interest penalty, or penalties as a result of the pass-through 245
entity's making the election provided for under division (D) of 246
this section. For the purposes of division (D) of this section, 247

S. B. No. 205 Page 10
As Introduced
"correct tax due" means the tax that would have been paid by the 248
pass-through entity had the single return been filed in a manner 249
reflecting the commissioner's findings. Nothing in division (D) 250
of this section shall be construed to make or hold a pass- 251
through entity liable for tax attributable to a pass-through 252
entity investor's income from a source other than the pass- 253
through entity electing to file the single return. 254
(E) If a husband and wife file a joint federal income tax 255
return for a taxable year, they shall file a joint return under 256
this section for that taxable year, and their liabilities are 257
joint and several, but, if the federal income tax liability of 258
either spouse is determined on a separate federal income tax 259
return, they shall file separate returns under this section. 260
If either spouse is not required to file a federal income 261
tax return and either or both are required to file a return 262
pursuant to this chapter, they may elect to file separate or 263
joint returns, and, pursuant to that election, their liabilities 264
are separate or joint and several. If a husband and wife file 265
separate returns pursuant to this chapter, each must claim the 266
taxpayer's own exemption, but not both, as authorized under 267
section 5747.02 of the Revised Code on the taxpayer's own 268
return. 269
(F) Each return or notice required to be filed under this 270
section shall contain the signature of the taxpayer or the 271
taxpayer's duly authorized agent and of the person who prepared 272
the return for the taxpayer, and shall include the taxpayer's 273
social security number. Each return shall be verified by a 274
declaration under the penalties of perjury. The tax commissioner 275
shall prescribe the form that the signature and declaration 276
shall take. 277

S. B. No. 205 Page 11
As Introduced
(G) Each return or notice required to be filed under this 278
section shall be made and filed as required by section 5747.04 279
of the Revised Code, on or before the fifteenth day of April of 280
each year, on forms that the tax commissioner shall prescribe, 281
together with remittance made payable to the treasurer of state 282
in the combined amount of the state and all school district 283
income taxes shown to be due on the form. 284
Upon good cause shown, the commissioner may extend the 285
period for filing any notice or return required to be filed 286
under this section and may adopt rules relating to extensions. 287
If the extension results in an extension of time for the payment 288
of any state or school district income tax liability with 289
respect to which the return is filed, the taxpayer shall pay at 290
the time the tax liability is paid an amount of interest 291
computed at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of 292
the Revised Code on that liability from the time that payment is 293
due without extension to the time of actual payment. Except as 294
provided in section 5747.132 of the Revised Code, in addition to 295
all other interest charges and penalties, all taxes imposed 296
under this chapter or Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code and 297
remaining unpaid after they become due, except combined amounts 298
due of one dollar or less, bear interest at the rate per annum 299
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code until paid or 300
until the day an assessment is issued under section 5747.13 of 301
the Revised Code, whichever occurs first. 302
If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to 303
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by section 5747.02 of the 304

the Revised Code on the annual return required to be filed under 320
this section. 321
(I) If a pass-through entity elects to file a single 322
return under division (D) of this section and if any investor is 323
required to file the annual return and make the payment of taxes 324
required by this chapter on account of the investor's other 325
income that is not included in a single return filed by a pass- 326
through entity or any other investor elects to file the annual 327
return, the investor is entitled to a refundable credit equal to 328
the investor's proportionate share of the tax paid by the pass- 329
through entity on behalf of the investor. The investor shall 330
claim the credit for the investor's taxable year in which or 331
with which ends the taxable year of the pass-through entity. 332
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow any credit 333
provided in this chapter to be claimed more than once. For the 334
purpose of computing any interest, penalty, or interest penalty, 335
the investor shall be deemed to have paid the refundable credit 336
provided by this division on the day that the pass-through 337

required to be filed under this section includes a box that the 341
taxpayer may check to authorize a paid tax preparer who prepared 342
the return to communicate with the department of taxation about 343
matters pertaining to the return. The return or instructions 344
accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box 345
the taxpayer authorizes the department of taxation to contact 346
the preparer concerning questions that arise during the 347
processing of the return and authorizes the preparer only to 348
provide the department with information that is missing from the 349
return, to contact the department for information about the 350
processing of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund 351
or payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical 352
errors, offsets, or return preparation that the taxpayer has 353
received from the department and has shown to the preparer. 354
(K) The tax commissioner shall permit individual taxpayers 355
to instruct the department of taxation to cause any refund of 356
overpaid taxes to be deposited directly into a checking account, 357
savings account, or an individual retirement account or 358
individual retirement annuity, or preexisting college savings 359
plan or program account offered by the Ohio tuition trust 360
authority under Chapter 3334. of the Revised Code, as designated 361
by the taxpayer, when the taxpayer files the annual return 362
required by this section electronically. 363

is the owner of an electing pass-through entity, as defined in 365
section 5747.38 of the Revised Code, does not have Ohio adjusted 366
gross income or, in the case of a trust, modified Ohio taxable 367
income other than from one or more electing pass-through 368

section, utilizing the refundable credit under section 5747.39 372
of the Revised Code equal to the owner's proportionate share of 373
the tax levied under section 5747.38 of the Revised Code and 374
paid by the electing pass-through entity, and making the payment 375
of taxes imposed under section 5747.02 of the Revised Code. 376
