relocation, or duplication of that taken or upon the election of 156
such political subdivision, public corporation, public utility, 157
or common carrier for the payment of compensation, if any, at 158

(b) If any restoration or duplication proposed to be made 160

smaller of the following: 188
(a) The last annual installment of taxes due from the 189
acquired property before removal from the tax duplicate; 190
(b) An amount equal to the difference between the combined 191
revenue from real estate taxes of all the taxing districts in 192
which the property is located in the tax year immediately prior 193
to the removal of the acquired property from the tax duplicate, 194
and either: 195
(i) The total revenue which would be produced by the tax 196
rate of each such taxing district in the tax year immediately 197

taxing district or districts in the county in which the property 207
is located. 208
The county auditor of the county in which that property is 209

provided, that no funds of a county other than those of the 219
county transit board or, if the transit system is operated by 220
the board of county commissioners, other than those in the 221
