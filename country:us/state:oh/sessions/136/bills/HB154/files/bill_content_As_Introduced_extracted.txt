the legislative authority and the owner of the property shall 21
enter into a written agreement pursuant to section 3735.671 of 22
the Revised Code prior to commencement of construction or 23

not be formally approved by the legislative authority until the 27
board of education approves the agreement in the manner 28
prescribed by that section. 29
(B) The housing officer shall verify the construction of 30
the new structure or the cost of the remodeling of the existing 31
structure and the facts asserted in the application. The housing 32
officer shall determine whether the construction or remodeling 33
meets the requirements for an exemption under this section. In 34
cases involving a structure of historical or architectural 35
significance, the housing officer shall not determine whether 36
the remodeling meets the requirements for a tax exemption unless 37
the appropriateness of the remodeling has been certified, in 38
writing, by the society, association, agency, or legislative 39
authority that has designated the structure or by any 40
organization or person authorized, in writing, by such society, 41
association, agency, or legislative authority to certify the 42
appropriateness of the remodeling. 43
(C)(C)(1) If the construction or remodeling meets the 44
requirements for exemption, the housing officer shall forward 45
request approval of the application from the board of education 46
of the city, local, or exempted village school district within 47

officer not later than forty-five days after the application is 54
certified to the board. The board may include in the resolution 55
conditions under which the board would approve the application. 56
The housing officer may approve an application at any time after 57
the board certifies its resolution approving the application, 58

not required under division (C)(1) of this section if, for each 63
tax year the dwelling is exempted from taxation, the sum of the 64
following quantities, as estimated at or prior to the time the 65
application is formally approved by the housing officer, equals 66
or exceeds twenty-five per cent of the amount of taxes, as 67
estimated at or prior to that time, that would have been charged 68
and payable that year upon the dwelling had that dwelling not 69

The estimates of quantities used for purposes of division 81
(C)(2) of this section shall be estimated by the housing 82

waiving its right to approve applications under this division 87
and that resolution remains in effect, approval of an 88
application by the board is not required under division (C)(1) 89
of this section. If a board adopts a resolution waiving its 90
right to approve applications, the board shall certify a copy of 91
the resolution to the housing officer. If the board rescinds 92
such a resolution, it shall certify notice of the rescission to 93
the housing officer. 94

with the notice requirements prescribed under section 5709.83 of 111
the Revised Code, unless the board has adopted a resolution 112
under that section waiving its right to receive such a notice. 113
(D) Except as provided in division (F) of this section, 114
the tax exemption shall first apply in the year the construction 115
or remodeling would first be taxable but for this section. In 116
the case of remodeling that qualifies for exemption, a 117
percentage, not to exceed one hundred per cent, of the increased 118
assessed valuation of an existing structure after remodeling 119
began shall be exempted from real property taxation. In the case 120
of construction of a structure that qualifies for exemption, a 121
percentage, not to exceed one hundred per cent, of the assessed 122
value of the structure shall be exempted from real property 123
taxation. In either case, the percentage shall be the percentage 124
set forth in the agreement if the structure or remodeling is to 125
be used for commercial or industrial purposes, or the percentage 126
set forth in the resolution describing the community 127
reinvestment area if the structure or remodeling is to be used 128

for which exemptions from real property taxation may be granted 132
for the following periods: 133
(1) For every dwelling and commercial or industrial 134
properties, located within the same community reinvestment area, 135
upon which the cost of remodeling is at least two thousand five 136

fifteen years. The period of exemption for a dwelling described 141

housing officer shall determine whether the property continues 170

housing officer's findings to the complainant. If the housing 172
officer determines that the property does not meet the 173
requirements for exemption, the housing officer shall notify the 174
county auditor, who shall correct the tax list and duplicate 175
accordingly. 176

reinvestment area may file an application for an exemption after 178
the year the construction first became subject to taxation. The 179

prescribed under this section and shall be granted if the 181
construction that is the subject of the application otherwise 182
meets the requirements for an exemption under this section. If 183
