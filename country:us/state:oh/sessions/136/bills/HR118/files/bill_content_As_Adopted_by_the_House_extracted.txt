In memory of Ronald Edward Hood.
WHEREAS, The members of the House of Representatives of the 136th 1
General Assembly of Ohio were deeply saddened to learn of the death of 2
Ronald Edward Hood and pay tribute to his memory; and 3
WHEREAS, Ron Hood, a devoted Christian, will be remembered fondly 4
by all those who knew him, and his absence will leave an irreparable 5
void in our society. Widely respected for his tenure with the Ohio 6

Representatives in 1994, and over the course of his career, he proudly 8
represented the 57th, 78th, and 91st districts. In addition, he served 9
as a member of the commerce and labor and criminal justice committees, 10
and clearly, his tremendous devotion to Christ first, to principle, 11

and to duty earned him the appreciation of his colleagues and 12
constituents alike; and 13
WHEREAS, Ron Hood’s passion for community service was always 14
evident in his own approach to public life, and he helped to guarantee 15
a high level of success for all projects with which he was associated. 16
He also held the post of executive director for National Right to Work 17
Committee, and he was admired by his fellow citizens, friends, and 18
family alike for his deep personal commitment. He has certainly left 19
an enduring legacy that will surely live on; and 20
WHEREAS, Without question, Ron Hood made the world much fuller, 21
and he was especially devoted to the individuals who had a treasured 22
relationship with him, including his children, Ellah, Edward, Judah, 23
Quinne, Wesley, and the late Ronald. All those who cherished him can 24
find strength and solace in the happy moments shared with this great 25
man. Most assuredly, the State of Ohio has benefited exponentially 26
from his life’s work, and he will be remembered for his visionary 27
example of citizenship; therefore be it 28
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the House of Representatives of 29
the 136th General Assembly of Ohio, in adopting this Resolution, offer 30
our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Ronald Edward 31
Hood and express a profound sense of loss and sincere regret on the 32
sorrowful occasion of his death; and be it further 33
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives transmit 34
a duly authenticated copy of this Resolution to the family of Ronald 35
Edward Hood. 36
