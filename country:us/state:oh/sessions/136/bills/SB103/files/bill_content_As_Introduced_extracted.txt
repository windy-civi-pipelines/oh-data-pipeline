Section 15:

or railroads, revise and correct its valuations of property, 184
showing such revisions and corrections as a whole and as to each 185

disposal system company, projected valuation and value as of the 190
date certain, if applicable because of a future date or dates 191

the several kinds and classes of property of such public utility 200
or railroad and upon the property as a whole and give such 201

support of its protest or by any representative of the public 210
against such protest. If, after the hearing of any protest of 211
any valuation so fixed, the commission is of the opinion that 212
its inventory is incomplete or inaccurate or that its valuation 213
is incorrect, it shall make such changes as are necessary and 214
shall issue an order making such corrected valuations final. A 215
final valuation by the commission and all classifications made 216
for the ascertainment of such valuations shall be public and are 217
prima-facie evidence relative to the value of the property. 218
"Valuation" and "value," as used in this section, may 219
include, with respect to a natural gas, water-works, or sewage 220

Sec. 4909.15. (A) The public utilities commission, when 224
fixing and determining just and reasonable rates, fares, tolls, 225
rentals, and charges, shall determine: 226
(1) The valuation as of the date certain of the property 227
of the public utility used and useful or, with respect to a 228
natural gas, water-works, or sewage disposal system company, 229

projected to be used and useful as of the date certain or, as 230
provided for in division (E) of this section, as of the dates 231
certain, in rendering the public utility service for which rates 232
are to be fixed and determined. The valuation so determined 233
shall be the total value as set forth in division (C)(9) of 234

Section 16:
section 4909.05 of the Revised Code, and a reasonable allowance 235
for materials and supplies and cash working capital as 236
determined by the commission. 237
The commission, in its discretion, may include in the 238
valuation a reasonable allowance for construction work in 239
progress but, in no event, may such an allowance be made by the 240
commission until it has determined that the particular 241
construction project is at least seventy-five per cent complete. 242
In determining the percentage completion of a particular 243
construction project, the commission shall consider, among other 244
relevant criteria, the per cent of time elapsed in construction; 245
the per cent of construction funds, excluding allowance for 246
funds used during construction, expended, or obligated to such 247
construction funds budgeted where all such funds are adjusted to 248
reflect current purchasing power; and any physical inspection 249
performed by or on behalf of any party, including the 250
commission's staff. 251
A reasonable allowance for construction work in progress 252
shall not exceed ten per cent of the total valuation as stated 253
in this division, not including such allowance for construction 254
work in progress. 255
Where the commission permits an allowance for construction 256
work in progress, the dollar value of the project or portion 257
thereof included in the valuation as construction work in 258
progress shall not be included in the valuation as plant in 259

service until such time as the total revenue effect of the 260
construction work in progress allowance is offset by the total 261
revenue effect of the plant in service exclusion. Carrying 262
charges calculated in a manner similar to allowance for funds 263
used during construction shall accrue on that portion of the 264
project in service but not reflected in rates as plant in 265
service, and such accrued carrying charges shall be included in 266
the valuation of the property at the conclusion of the offset 267
period for purposes of division (C)(9) of section 4909.05 of the 268
Revised Code. 269
From and after April 10, 1985, no allowance for 270
construction work in progress as it relates to a particular 271
construction project shall be reflected in rates for a period 272
exceeding forty-eight consecutive months commencing on the date 273
the initial rates reflecting such allowance become effective, 274
except as otherwise provided in this division. 275
The applicable maximum period in rates for an allowance 276
for construction work in progress as it relates to a particular 277
construction project shall be tolled if, and to the extent, a 278
delay in the in-service date of the project is caused by the 279
action or inaction of any federal, state, county, or municipal 280
agency having jurisdiction, where such action or inaction 281
relates to a change in a rule, standard, or approval of such 282
agency, and where such action or inaction is not the result of 283
the failure of the utility to reasonably endeavor to comply with 284
any rule, standard, or approval prior to such change. 285
In the event that such period expires before the project 286
goes into service, the commission shall exclude, from the date 287
of expiration, the allowance for the project as construction 288
work in progress from rates, except that the commission may 289
S. B. No. 103 Page 11
As Introduced
extend the expiration date up to twelve months for good cause 290
shown. 291
In the event that a utility has permanently canceled, 292
abandoned, or terminated construction of a project for which it 293
was previously permitted a construction work in progress 294
allowance, the commission immediately shall exclude the 295
allowance for the project from the valuation. 296
In the event that a construction work in progress project 297
previously included in the valuation is removed from the 298
valuation pursuant to this division, any revenues collected by 299
the utility from its customers after April 10, 1985, that 300
resulted from such prior inclusion shall be offset against 301
future revenues over the same period of time as the project was 302
included in the valuation as construction work in progress. The 303
total revenue effect of such offset shall not exceed the total 304
revenues previously collected. 305
In no event shall the total revenue effect of any offset 306
or offsets provided under division (A)(1) of this section exceed 307
the total revenue effect of any construction work in progress 308
allowance. 309
(2) A fair and reasonable rate of return to the utility on 310
the valuation as determined in division (A)(1) of this section 311
and based on the capital structure of the public utility as of 312
the date certain or, as provided for in division (E) of this 313

Section 17:
section, as of the dates certain; 314
(3) The dollar annual return to which the utility is 315
entitled by applying the fair and reasonable rate of return as 316
determined under division (A)(2) of this section to the 317
valuation of the utility determined under division (A)(1) of 318
S. B. No. 103 Page 12

this section; 319
(4) The cost to the utility of rendering the public 320
utility service for the test period used for the determination 321
under division (C)(1) of this section, less the total of any 322
interest on cash or credit refunds paid, pursuant to section 323

Section 18:
4909.42 of the Revised Code, by the utility during the test 324
period. 325
(a) Federal, state, and local taxes imposed on or measured 326
by net income may, in the discretion of the commission, be 327
computed by the normalization method of accounting, provided the 328
utility maintains accounting reserves that reflect differences 329
between taxes actually payable and taxes on a normalized basis, 330
provided that no determination as to the treatment in the rate- 331
making process of such taxes shall be made that will result in 332
loss of any tax depreciation or other tax benefit to which the 333
utility would otherwise be entitled, and further provided that 334
such tax benefit as redounds to the utility as a result of such 335
a computation may not be retained by the company, used to fund 336
any dividend or distribution, or utilized for any purpose other 337
than the defrayal of the operating expenses of the utility and 338
the defrayal of the expenses of the utility in connection with 339
construction work. 340
(b) The amount of any tax credits granted to an electric 341
light company under section 5727.391 of the Revised Code for 342
Ohio coal burned prior to January 1, 2000, shall not be retained 343
by the company, used to fund any dividend or distribution, or 344
utilized for any purposes other than the defrayal of the 345
allowable operating expenses of the company and the defrayal of 346
the allowable expenses of the company in connection with the 347
installation, acquisition, construction, or use of a compliance 348

years after initially claiming the credit through an offset to 352
the company's rates or fuel component, as determined by the 353
commission, as set forth in schedules filed by the company under 354

Section 19:
section 4905.30 of the Revised Code. As used in division (A)(4) 355
(b) of this section, "compliance facility" has the same meaning 356
as in section 5727.391 of the Revised Code. 357
(B) The commission shall compute the gross annual revenues 358
to which the utility is entitled by adding the dollar amount of 359
return under division (A)(3) of this section to the cost, for 360
the test period used for the determination under division (C)(1) 361
of this section, of rendering the public utility service under 362
division (A)(4) of this section. 363

to the date the application is filed and ending not more than 370
nine months subsequent to that date. The test period for 371
determining revenues and expenses of the utility shall be the 372
test period proposed by the utility, unless otherwise ordered by 373

pursuant to division (B) of section 4909.43 of the Revised Code 573
to increase any existing rate, joint rate, toll, classification, 574

is based. If such application proposes a new service or the use 587
of new equipment, or proposes the establishment or amendment of 588
a regulation, the application shall fully describe the new 589
service or equipment, or the regulation proposed to be 590
established or amended, and shall explain how the proposed 591
service or equipment differs from services or equipment 592
presently offered or in use, or how the regulation proposed to 593
be established or amended differs from regulations presently in 594

Sec. 4909.07. The public utilities commission, during the 175
making of the valuation provided for in sections 4909.04 to 176

protest has been filed by any public utility or railroad, the 206
commission shall fix a time for hearing such protest and shall 207
consider at such hearing any matter material thereto presented 208
by such public utility, railroad, or municipal corporation, in 209
support of its protest or by any representative of the public 210

any valuation so fixed, the commission is of the opinion that 212
its inventory is incomplete or inaccurate or that its valuation 213
is incorrect, it shall make such changes as are necessary and 214
shall issue an order making such corrected valuations final. A 215
final valuation by the commission and all classifications made 216
for the ascertainment of such valuations shall be public and are 217
prima-facie evidence relative to the value of the property. 218

Sec. 4909.15. (A) The public utilities commission, when 224
fixing and determining just and reasonable rates, fares, tolls, 225
rentals, and charges, shall determine: 226
(1) The valuation as of the date certain of the property 227
of the public utility used and useful or, with respect to a 228
natural gas, water-works, or sewage disposal system company, 229

projected to be used and useful as of the date certain or, as 230
provided for in division (E) of this section, as of the dates 231
certain, in rendering the public utility service for which rates 232
are to be fixed and determined. The valuation so determined 233
shall be the total value as set forth in division (C)(9) of 234
section 4909.05 of the Revised Code, and a reasonable allowance 235
for materials and supplies and cash working capital as 236
determined by the commission. 237
The commission, in its discretion, may include in the 238
valuation a reasonable allowance for construction work in 239
progress but, in no event, may such an allowance be made by the 240
commission until it has determined that the particular 241
construction project is at least seventy-five per cent complete. 242
In determining the percentage completion of a particular 243
construction project, the commission shall consider, among other 244
relevant criteria, the per cent of time elapsed in construction; 245
the per cent of construction funds, excluding allowance for 246
funds used during construction, expended, or obligated to such 247
construction funds budgeted where all such funds are adjusted to 248
reflect current purchasing power; and any physical inspection 249
performed by or on behalf of any party, including the 250
commission's staff. 251
A reasonable allowance for construction work in progress 252
shall not exceed ten per cent of the total valuation as stated 253
in this division, not including such allowance for construction 254
work in progress. 255
Where the commission permits an allowance for construction 256
work in progress, the dollar value of the project or portion 257
thereof included in the valuation as construction work in 258
progress shall not be included in the valuation as plant in 259

service until such time as the total revenue effect of the 260
construction work in progress allowance is offset by the total 261
revenue effect of the plant in service exclusion. Carrying 262
charges calculated in a manner similar to allowance for funds 263
used during construction shall accrue on that portion of the 264
project in service but not reflected in rates as plant in 265
service, and such accrued carrying charges shall be included in 266
the valuation of the property at the conclusion of the offset 267
period for purposes of division (C)(9) of section 4909.05 of the 268
Revised Code. 269
From and after April 10, 1985, no allowance for 270
construction work in progress as it relates to a particular 271
construction project shall be reflected in rates for a period 272
exceeding forty-eight consecutive months commencing on the date 273
the initial rates reflecting such allowance become effective, 274
except as otherwise provided in this division. 275
The applicable maximum period in rates for an allowance 276
for construction work in progress as it relates to a particular 277
construction project shall be tolled if, and to the extent, a 278
delay in the in-service date of the project is caused by the 279
action or inaction of any federal, state, county, or municipal 280
agency having jurisdiction, where such action or inaction 281
relates to a change in a rule, standard, or approval of such 282
agency, and where such action or inaction is not the result of 283
the failure of the utility to reasonably endeavor to comply with 284
any rule, standard, or approval prior to such change. 285
In the event that such period expires before the project 286
goes into service, the commission shall exclude, from the date 287
of expiration, the allowance for the project as construction 288
work in progress from rates, except that the commission may 289

S. B. No. 103 Page 11

extend the expiration date up to twelve months for good cause 290
shown. 291
In the event that a utility has permanently canceled, 292
abandoned, or terminated construction of a project for which it 293
was previously permitted a construction work in progress 294
allowance, the commission immediately shall exclude the 295
allowance for the project from the valuation. 296
In the event that a construction work in progress project 297
previously included in the valuation is removed from the 298
valuation pursuant to this division, any revenues collected by 299
the utility from its customers after April 10, 1985, that 300
resulted from such prior inclusion shall be offset against 301
future revenues over the same period of time as the project was 302
included in the valuation as construction work in progress. The 303
total revenue effect of such offset shall not exceed the total 304
revenues previously collected. 305
In no event shall the total revenue effect of any offset 306
or offsets provided under division (A)(1) of this section exceed 307
the total revenue effect of any construction work in progress 308
allowance. 309
(2) A fair and reasonable rate of return to the utility on 310
the valuation as determined in division (A)(1) of this section 311

the date certain or, as provided for in division (E) of this 313
section, as of the dates certain; 314

entitled by applying the fair and reasonable rate of return as 316

(4) The cost to the utility of rendering the public 320
utility service for the test period used for the determination 321
under division (C)(1) of this section, less the total of any 322
interest on cash or credit refunds paid, pursuant to section 323
4909.42 of the Revised Code, by the utility during the test 324
period. 325
(a) Federal, state, and local taxes imposed on or measured 326
by net income may, in the discretion of the commission, be 327
computed by the normalization method of accounting, provided the 328
utility maintains accounting reserves that reflect differences 329
between taxes actually payable and taxes on a normalized basis, 330
provided that no determination as to the treatment in the rate- 331
making process of such taxes shall be made that will result in 332
loss of any tax depreciation or other tax benefit to which the 333
utility would otherwise be entitled, and further provided that 334
such tax benefit as redounds to the utility as a result of such 335
a computation may not be retained by the company, used to fund 336
any dividend or distribution, or utilized for any purpose other 337
than the defrayal of the operating expenses of the utility and 338
the defrayal of the expenses of the utility in connection with 339
construction work. 340
(b) The amount of any tax credits granted to an electric 341
light company under section 5727.391 of the Revised Code for 342
Ohio coal burned prior to January 1, 2000, shall not be retained 343

utilized for any purposes other than the defrayal of the 345
allowable operating expenses of the company and the defrayal of 346
the allowable expenses of the company in connection with the 347
installation, acquisition, construction, or use of a compliance 348

light company under that section for Ohio coal burned prior to 350
January 1, 2000, shall be returned to its customers within three 351
years after initially claiming the credit through an offset to 352
the company's rates or fuel component, as determined by the 353
commission, as set forth in schedules filed by the company under 354
section 4905.30 of the Revised Code. As used in division (A)(4) 355
(b) of this section, "compliance facility" has the same meaning 356
as in section 5727.391 of the Revised Code. 357
(B) The commission shall compute the gross annual revenues 358
to which the utility is entitled by adding the dollar amount of 359
return under division (A)(3) of this section to the cost, for 360
the test period used for the determination under division (C)(1) 361
of this section, of rendering the public utility service under 362
division (A)(4) of this section. 363
(C)(1) Except as provided in division divisions (D) and 364

utility may propose a test period for this determination that is 368
any twelve-month period beginning not more than six months prior 369
to the date the application is filed and ending not more than 370
nine months subsequent to that date. The test period for 371
determining revenues and expenses of the utility shall be the 372
test period proposed by the utility, unless otherwise ordered by 373
the commission determines that the proposed test period does not 374
comply with the requirements of divisions (C) to (E) of this 375

period immediately following the test period, reasonably 386
expected to occur. The natural gas, water-works, or sewage 387
disposal system company shall identify and quantify, 388
individually, any proposed adjustments. The commission shall 389
incorporate the proposed adjustments into the determination if 390
the adjustments are just and reasonable. 391

shall approve, a test period that is any twelve-month period 393
beginning not earlier than twelve months prior to the date the 394

Sec. 4909.18. Any public utility desiring to establish any 565
rate, joint rate, toll, classification, charge, or rental, or to 566
modify, amend, change, increase, or reduce any existing rate, 567
joint rate, toll, classification, charge, or rental, or any 568
regulation or practice affecting the same, shall file a written 569
application with the public utilities commission. Except for 570
actions under section 4909.16 of the Revised Code, no public 571
utility may issue the notice of intent to file an application 572
pursuant to division (B) of section 4909.43 of the Revised Code 573
to increase any existing rate, joint rate, toll, classification, 574
charge, or rental, until a final order under this section has 575
been issued by the commission on any pending prior application 576
to increase the same rate, joint rate, toll, classification, 577
charge, or rental or until two hundred seventy-five days after 578
filing such application, whichever is sooner. Such application 579
shall be verified by the president or a vice-president and the 580
secretary or treasurer of the applicant. Such application shall 581
contain a schedule of the existing rate, joint rate, toll, 582
classification, charge, or rental, or regulation or practice 583
affecting the same, a schedule of the modification amendment, 584
change, increase, or reduction sought to be established, and a 585

statement of the facts and grounds upon which such application 586
is based. If such application proposes a new service or the use 587
of new equipment, or proposes the establishment or amendment of 588
a regulation, the application shall fully describe the new 589
service or equipment, or the regulation proposed to be 590
established or amended, and shall explain how the proposed 591
service or equipment differs from services or equipment 592
presently offered or in use, or how the regulation proposed to 593
be established or amended differs from regulations presently in 594
effect. The application shall provide such additional 595
information as the commission may require in its discretion. If 596
the commission determines that such application is not for an 597
increase in any rate, joint rate, toll, classification, charge, 598
or rental, the commission may permit the filing of the schedule 599
proposed in the application and fix the time when such schedule 600
shall take effect. If it appears to the commission that the 601
proposals in the application may be unjust or unreasonable, the 602
commission shall set the matter for hearing and shall give 603
notice of such hearing by sending written notice of the date set 604
for the hearing to the public utility and publishing notice of 605
the hearing one time in a newspaper of general circulation in 606
each county in the service area affected by the application. At 607
such hearing, the burden of proof to show that the proposals in 608
the application are just and reasonable shall be upon the public 609
utility. After such hearing, the commission shall, where 610
practicable, issue an appropriate order within six months from 611
the date the application was filed. 612
If the commission determines that said application is for 613
an increase in any rate, joint rate, toll, classification, 614
charge, or rental there shall also, unless otherwise ordered by 615
the commission, be filed with the application in duplicate the 616
