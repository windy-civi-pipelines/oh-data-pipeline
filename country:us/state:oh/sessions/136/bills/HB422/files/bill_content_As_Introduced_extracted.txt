required shall be based on the estimated millage for the levy as 280
appearing in the ballot language. For voted taxes levied under 281

question to add that territory is approved by the applicable 288
percentage of electors of the taxing unit or the portion of the 289

Sec. 5705.171. (A) As used in this section, "voted tax" 260
means a tax levy authorized under any section of the Revised 261
Code that is in excess of the ten-mill limitation and subject to 262
approval by electors. 263
(B) Notwithstanding any other section of the Revised Code 264
to the contrary: 265
(1) No voted tax shall be levied unless approved by the 266
following percentage of electors of the taxing unit proposing 267
the levy: 268
(a) For levies with an aggregate rate of not more than one 269
mill, fifty per cent; 270
(b) For levies with an aggregate rate of more than one 271
mill but not more than two mills, sixty per cent; 272
(c) For levies with an aggregate rate of more than two 273
mills, sixty-six per cent. 274
As used in the context of voted taxes in the Revised Code, 275
a "majority" of such electors means the applicable percentage of 276
such electors required under division (B)(1) of this section. 277
For voted taxes levied at whatever rate is required to produce a 278
specified amount of tax money, the percentage of such electors 279
required shall be based on the estimated millage for the levy as 280
appearing in the ballot language. For voted taxes levied under 281
section 5705.212 of the Revised Code, the percentage of such 282
electors required shall be based on the aggregate rate of the 283
original tax and each incremental tax. 284

question to add that territory is approved by the applicable 288
percentage of electors of the taxing unit or the portion of the 289
taxing unit required by law to approve the expansion under 290
division (B)(1) of this section, based on the millage of the 291
voted tax that would be extended to that territory. 292
