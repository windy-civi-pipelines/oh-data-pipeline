In memory of Ben Espy.
WHEREAS, The members of the Senate of the 136th General Assembly 1
of Ohio extend our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of 2
Ben Espy on the sorrowful occasion of his death; and 3
WHEREAS, Ben Espy left an indelible impression on the people whose 4
lives he touched, and he will be remembered as a spirited individual 5
who contributed immeasurably to the world around him. An attorney, he 6
worked for Allegheny Airlines as a corporate lawyer and served the 7
U.S. Air Force as an assistant staff judge advocate at Hancock Field 8
Air Force Base and the Ohio Attorney General’s Office as a staff 9
member before starting his own law practice in 1977. Widely renowned 10
for his career in public office, he was a member of the Columbus City 11
Council for ten years, holding the post of president pro tempore and 12
then the Ohio Senate for ten years, serving as the assistant minority 13
leader and minority leader. He was active with several local and state 14
organizations and started the Columbus Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 15
Holiday Celebration and the Columbus Youth Corps. Indeed, he will be 16
remembered for his generosity, talents, and seemingly inexhaustible 17
energy; and 18
WHEREAS, Ben Espy’s regard for improving the quality of life in 19
our society was clearly evident in his personal sacrifices of time and 20
effort to family, friends, and community. Giving generously of his 21
energy and abilities in all of his endeavors, he displayed exceptional 22

concern and insight, and his absence will be keenly felt; and 23
WHEREAS, A loving husband to his wife, the late Kathlynne, a 24
devoted father to his four children, Elizabeth, Amy, Laura, and 25
Lynnette, and a doting grandfather to his numerous grandchildren, Ben 26
Espy always used his talents to the benefit of others, and the warmth 27
and understanding he readily extended to those around him will stand 28
as a testament to his personal character. Although the void which his 29
death has created can never be filled, the legacy of care and 30
commitment he established will surely live on; therefore be it 31
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the Senate of the 136th General 32
Assembly of Ohio, in adopting this Resolution, pay tribute to the 33
memory of a truly honorable man, Ben Espy; and be it further 34
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit a duly 35
authenticated copy of this Resolution to the family of Ben Espy. 36
