property. The board may offer real property for sale as an 23
entire tract or in parcels. 24
(B) When the board of education has offered real or 25
personal property for sale at public auction at least once 26
pursuant to division (A) of this section, and the property has 27
not been sold, the board may sell it at a private sale. 28
Regardless of how it was offered at public auction, at a private 29
sale, the board shall, as it considers best, sell real property 30
as an entire tract or in parcels, and personal property in a 31
single lot or in several lots. 32

owns in its corporate capacity for the identified real property 68
or by using real property that the board owns in its corporate 69

acquisition made pursuant to this division shall be made by a 72
conveyance executed by the president and the treasurer of the 73
board. 74
(G) When a school district board of education has property 75
that the board, by resolution, finds is not needed for school 76
district use, is obsolete, or is unfit for the use for which it 77
was acquired, the board may donate that property in accordance 78
with this division if the fair market value of the property is, 79
in the opinion of the board, two thousand five hundred dollars 80

or less. 81
The property may be donated to an eligible nonprofit 82
organization that is located in this state and is exempt from 83
federal income taxation pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 501(a) and (c)(3). 84
Before donating any property under this division, the board 85
shall adopt a resolution expressing its intent to make unneeded, 86
obsolete, or unfit-for-use school district property available to 87
these organizations. The resolution shall include guidelines and 88
procedures the board considers to be necessary to implement the 89
donation program and shall indicate whether the school district 90
will conduct the donation program or the board will contract 91
with a representative to conduct it. If a representative is 92
known when the resolution is adopted, the resolution shall 93
provide contact information such as the representative's name, 94
address, and telephone number. 95
The resolution shall include within its procedures a 96
requirement that any nonprofit organization desiring to obtain 97
donated property under this division shall submit a written 98
notice to the board or its representative. The written notice 99
shall include evidence that the organization is a nonprofit 100
organization that is located in this state and is exempt from 101
federal income taxation pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 501(a) and (c)(3); 102
a description of the organization's primary purpose; a 103
description of the type or types of property the organization 104
needs; and the name, address, and telephone number of a person 105
designated by the organization's governing board to receive 106
donated property and to serve as its agent. The written notice 107
may be submitted electronically to the board or its 108
representative. 109
After adoption of the resolution, the board shall 110

S. B. No. 49 Page 5
As Introduced
continually post in the board's office notice of its intent to 111
donate school district property that is unneeded, obsolete, or 112
unfit for use to eligible nonprofit organizations. If the school 113
district maintains a web site on the internet, the notice shall 114
be posted continually at that web site. 115
The board or its representatives shall maintain a list of 116
all nonprofit organizations that notify the board or its 117
representative of their desire to obtain donated property under 118
this division and that the board or its representative 119
determines to be eligible, in accordance with the requirements 120
set forth in this section and in the donation program's 121
guidelines and procedures, to receive donated property. 122
The board or its representative also shall maintain a list 123
of all school district property the board finds to be unneeded, 124
obsolete, or unfit for use and to be available for donation 125
under this division. The list shall be posted continually in a 126
conspicuous location in the board's office, and, if the school 127
district maintains a web site on the internet, the list shall be 128
posted continually at that web site. An item of property on the 129
list shall be donated to the eligible nonprofit organization 130
that first declares to the board or its representative its 131
desire to obtain the item unless the board previously has 132
established, by resolution, a list of eligible nonprofit 133
organizations that shall be given priority with respect to the 134
item's donation. Priority may be given on the basis that the 135
purposes of a nonprofit organization have a direct relationship 136
to specific school district purposes of programs provided or 137
administered by the board. A resolution giving priority to 138
certain nonprofit organizations with respect to the donation of 139
an item of property shall specify the reasons why the 140
organizations are given that priority. 141

enter into a written agreement with the school district board 172
for the construction and sale of the project. In the case of a 173
joint vocational school district that receives assistance under 174
sections 3318.40 to 3318.45 of the Revised Code, if the school 175
district board of education and the school district electors 176
have satisfied the conditions prescribed in division (D)(1) of 177
section 3318.41 of the Revised Code, the commission shall enter 178
into an agreement with the school district board for the 179
construction and sale of the project. In either case, the 180
agreement shall include, but need not be limited to, the 181
following provisions: 182
(A) The sale and issuance of bonds or notes in 183
anticipation thereof, as soon as practicable after the execution 184
of the agreement, in an amount equal to the school district's 185
portion of the basic project cost, including any securities 186
authorized under division (J) of section 133.06 of the Revised 187
Code and dedicated by the school district board to payment of 188
the district's portion of the basic project cost of the project; 189
provided, that if at that time the county treasurer of each 190
county in which the school district is located has not commenced 191
the collection of taxes on the general duplicate of real and 192
public utility property for the year in which the controlling 193
board approved the project, the school district board shall 194
authorize the issuance of a first installment of bond 195
anticipation notes in an amount specified by the agreement, 196
which amount shall not exceed an amount necessary to raise the 197
net bonded indebtedness of the school district as of the date of 198
the controlling board's approval to within five thousand dollars 199
of the required level of indebtedness for the preceding year. In 200
the event that a first installment of bond anticipation notes is 201
issued, the school district board shall, as soon as practicable 202

S. B. No. 49 Page 8
As Introduced
after the county treasurer of each county in which the school 203
district is located has commenced the collection of taxes on the 204
general duplicate of real and public utility property for the 205
year in which the controlling board approved the project, 206
authorize the issuance of a second and final installment of bond 207
anticipation notes or a first and final issue of bonds. 208
The combined value of the first and second installment of 209
bond anticipation notes or the value of the first and final 210
issue of bonds shall be equal to the school district's portion 211
of the basic project cost. The proceeds of any such bonds shall 212
be used first to retire any bond anticipation notes. Otherwise, 213
the proceeds of such bonds and of any bond anticipation notes, 214
except the premium and accrued interest thereon, shall be 215
deposited in the school district's project construction fund. In 216
determining the amount of net bonded indebtedness for the 217
purpose of fixing the amount of an issue of either bonds or bond 218
anticipation notes, gross indebtedness shall be reduced by 219
moneys in the bond retirement fund only to the extent of the 220
moneys therein on the first day of the year preceding the year 221
in which the controlling board approved the project. Should 222
there be a decrease in the tax valuation of the school district 223
so that the amount of indebtedness that can be incurred on the 224
tax duplicates for the year in which the controlling board 225
approved the project is less than the amount of the first 226
installment of bond anticipation notes, there shall be paid from 227
the school district's project construction fund to the school 228
district's bond retirement fund to be applied against such notes 229
an amount sufficient to cause the net bonded indebtedness of the 230
school district, as of the first day of the year following the 231
year in which the controlling board approved the project, to be 232
within five thousand dollars of the required level of 233

S. B. No. 49 Page 9
As Introduced
indebtedness for the year in which the controlling board 234
approved the project. The maximum amount of indebtedness to be 235
incurred by any school district board as its share of the cost 236
of the project is either an amount that will cause its net 237
bonded indebtedness, as of the first day of the year following 238
the year in which the controlling board approved the project, to 239
be within five thousand dollars of the required level of 240
indebtedness, or an amount equal to the required percentage of 241
the basic project costs, whichever is greater. All bonds and 242
bond anticipation notes shall be issued in accordance with 243
Chapter 133. of the Revised Code, and notes may be renewed as 244
provided in section 133.22 of the Revised Code. 245
(B) The transfer of such funds of the school district 246
board available for the project, together with the proceeds of 247
the sale of the bonds or notes, except premium, accrued 248
interest, and interest included in the amount of the issue, to 249
the school district's project construction fund; 250

to pay all or part of the service charges on bonds issued to pay 262

requirement that the district board comply with the provisions 281
of that section. The district board may rescind the provision 282
prescribed under division (C)(2)(c) of this section only so long 283
as the electors of the district have approved, in accordance 284
with section 3318.063 of the Revised Code, the levy of a tax for 285
the maintenance of the classroom facilities acquired under the 286
district's project and that levy continues to be collected as 287
