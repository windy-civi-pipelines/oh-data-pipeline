2025-2026
Representatives King, Mathews, T.

A C O N C U R R E N T R E S O L U T I O N
To urge the Congress of the United States to pass H.R. 1
1907, known as the Defense Against Drones Act of 2025. 2
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
OHIO (THE SENATE CONCURRING):
WHEREAS, The use of unmanned aerial vehicles, otherwise 3
known as drones, for private, recreational, commercial, and 4
military purposes, has increased exponentially in recent years; 5
and 6
WHEREAS, Technology advancements have enabled drone cameras 7
to capture clear and detailed images, and the size of drones 8
enable them to enter spaces that are more private and intrusive 9
than other types of aircraft; and 10
WHEREAS, Many drones or their component parts are created 11
by foreign manufacturers, particularly those based in China, 12
which raises serious concerns over our national security, data 13
cybersecurity, and the further protection of privacy interests; 14
and 15
WHEREAS, Numerous recent incidents of suspicious and 16
unidentified drone activity over individuals' personal property 17
in Ohio have caused alarm over the safety of individual property 18
H. C. R. No. 15 Page 2
As Introduced
owners, their animals, and their agricultural products; and 19
WHEREAS, Homeowners have a reasonable expectation of 20
privacy and safety within their residences and on their 21
properties, so that a low-flying drone's trespass into the 22
airspace above that residence and property without warning is 23
not only a nuisance, but a blatant violation of that expectation 24
of privacy and safety; and 25
WHEREAS, Property rights are the foundation of a free 26
society, and under the Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 19, 27
private property rights are held inviolate. Thus, intrusions 28
within that sacred sphere disrupt the natural order of our 29
society; and 30
WHEREAS, Ohio's Castle Doctrine otherwise allows homeowners 31
to use reasonable force, including deadly force, if they 32
reasonably believe they or another person is in imminent danger 33
of death or serious physical harm while defending their home 34
from an intruder; and 35
WHEREAS, Current federal law prohibits willful damage, 36
destruction, or wreckage of aircraft, including drones, with 37
serious penalties of up to twenty years in prison and up to two 38
hundred fifty thousand dollars in fines, deterring homeowners 39
from exercising their rights to protect their property and sense 40
of security; and 41
WHEREAS, The Defense Against Drones Act of 2025 was 42
recently introduced in the United States House of 43
Representatives and allows a property owner to shoot a drone 44
flying up to two hundred feet above that owner's property with a 45
legally obtained shotgun, thus, preserving the privacy and 46
property rights of that homeowner; now therefore be it 47
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the 136th Ohio General 48
Assembly, urge the Congress of the United States to pass H.R. 49
H. C. R. No. 15 Page 3
As Introduced
1907, otherwise known as the Defense Against Drones Act of 2025, 50
to ensure the rights and safety of homeowners in Ohio and across 51
the United States; and be it further 52
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives 53
transmit duly authenticated copies of this resolution to the 54
President of the United States, the Speaker and Clerk of the 55
United States House of Representatives, the President Pro 56
Tempore and Secretary of the United States Senate, the members 57
of the Ohio Congressional delegation, and the news media of 58
