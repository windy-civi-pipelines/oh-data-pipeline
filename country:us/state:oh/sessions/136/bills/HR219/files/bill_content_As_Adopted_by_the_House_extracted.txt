WHEREAS, The members of the House of Representatives of the 136th 1
General Assembly of Ohio commemorate the Fiftieth Anniversary of the 2
S.S. Edmund Fitzgerald tragedy and the lives lost, including seven 3
from Northwest Ohio; and 4
WHEREAS, In its day, the S.S. Edmund Fitzgerald was the largest 5
ship on the Great Lakes. Based out of Cleveland under a permanent 6
charter of the Oglebay Norton Company, the vessel served several port 7
cities along the Great Lakes, and during its lifespan, it set six 8
international hauling records and traveled the equivalent of forty- 9
four times around the world, earning such nicknames as the “Pride of 10
the American Side” and the “Toledo Express”; and 11
WHEREAS, On November 10, 1975, the S.S. Edmund Fitzgerald sank in 12
a storm on Lake Superior with the loss of all twenty-nine crew 13
members, seven of whom were from Northwest Ohio, including Captain 14
Ernest McSorley of Ottawa Hills. The ship was the pride of America’s 15
and Ohio’s maritime shipping industry, and its loss claimed the lives 16
of several of our state’s most skilled nautical crewmen; and 17
WHEREAS, The Fiftieth Anniversary of the S.S. Edmund Fitzgerald 18
tragedy is a somber milestone. The tale of the tragedy was 19
immortalized in Gordon Lightfoot’s song “The Wreck of the Edmund 20
Fitzgerald,” and the valiant service and sacrifice of the ship and its 21
crew have earned them a hallowed place in Ohio’s maritime history, a 22
legacy that will long be remembered by the families of the victims and 23
the communities served by the Fitzgerald; therefore be it 24
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the House of Representatives of 25
