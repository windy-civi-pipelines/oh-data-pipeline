community; and 12
WHEREAS, The source of many social, religious, and humanitarian 13
projects and programs, Mount Carmel Community Baptist Church has 14
enhanced the quality of life in the area since its inception in 1925, 15

respect of the many citizens it has so capably served. We are certain 17
that in the years to come, the church will maintain the tradition of 18
spiritual enlightenment that has long been its hallmark; and 19
WHEREAS, The members of Mount Carmel Community Baptist Church have 20
long been actively involved in, and concerned about, the events in 21
their community, and this celebration offers them a unique opportunity 22
to share their memories and to reflect on the benefits of life in 23
their close-knit community. The congregation can, indeed, be proud of 24
their church, for they have built on the best traditions of the past 25
to ensure a peaceful and robust future; therefore be it 26
