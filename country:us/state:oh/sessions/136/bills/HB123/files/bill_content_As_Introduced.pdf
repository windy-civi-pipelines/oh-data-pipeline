BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF OHIO:
Section 1. That sections 3.02, 302.09, 305.02, 503.24, and 5
733.31 of the Revised Code be amended to read as follows: 6
Sec. 3.02. (A) When Subject to division (B) of this 7
section, when an elective office becomes vacant and is filled by 8
appointment, such appointee shall hold the office until the 9
appointee's successor is elected and qualified; and such 10
successor shall be elected for the unexpired term, at the first 11
general election for the office which is vacant that occurs more 12
than forty days after the vacancy has occurred; provided that 13
when the unexpired term ends within one year immediately 14
following the date of such general election, an election to fill 15
such unexpired term shall not be held and the appointment shall 16
be for such unexpired term. 17
(B) In the case of a vacancy in an office for which the 18

H. B. No. 123 Page 2
As Introduced
term expires in a month other than November, December, or 19
January, other than the office of judge or justice of any court, 20
if no election is held to fill the vacancy for the remainder of 21
the unexpired term, all of the following apply: 22
(1) If, when the vacancy occurs, a person has been 23
certified as elected to the office for the following full term, 24
the appointing authority shall notify the person to provide a 25
copy of the person's certificate of election to the appointing 26
authority. Upon being presented with a copy of the person's 27
certificate of election, the appointing authority shall appoint 28
the person to the office for the remainder of the unexpired 29
term. If the person fails to qualify to hold the office for the 30
remainder of the unexpired term, another person shall be 31
appointed under division (A) of this section to fill the vacancy 32
for the remainder of the unexpired term. 33
(2) If, when the vacancy occurs, a person has not been 34
certified as elected to the office for the following full term, 35
and the person appointed to fill the vacancy under division (A) 36
of this section is not elected to the office for the following 37
full term, the person shall hold the office only until the 38
person who is elected to the office for the following full term 39
is appointed and qualifies to serve the remainder of the 40
unexpired term under division (B)(3) of this section. However, 41
if the person who is elected to the office for the following 42
full term fails to qualify to hold the office for the remainder 43
of the unexpired term under division (B)(3) of this section, the 44
person appointed to fill the vacancy under division (A) of this 45
section shall hold the office for the remainder of the unexpired 46
term. 47
(3) If the person who is elected to the office for the 48

H. B. No. 123 Page 3
As Introduced
following full term was not already appointed to the office 49
under division (A) of this section, the appointing authority 50
shall notify the person to provide a copy of the person's 51
certificate of election to the appointing authority. Upon being 52
presented with a copy of the person's certificate of election, 53
the appointing authority shall appoint the person to the office 54
for the remainder of the unexpired term. 55
(4) As used in division (B) of this section, "appointing 56
authority" does not include a committee of a political party or 57
a committee of persons designated by a candidate. In the case of 58
an office for which such a committee may fill a vacancy, the 59
person who is designated to make an appointment to fill a 60
vacancy in an elective office whose previous occupant was 61
elected as an independent candidate is the appointing authority 62
for purposes of this division. 63
(C) When an elective office becomes vacant and is filled 64
by appointment under division (A) or (B)(2) of this section, the 65
appointing authority shall, immediately but no later than seven 66
days after making the appointment, certify it to the board of 67
elections and to the secretary of state. The board of elections 68
or, in the case of an appointment to a statewide office, the 69
secretary of state shall issue a certificate of appointment to 70
the appointee. Certificates of appointment shall be in such form 71
as the secretary of state shall prescribe. 72
(C) (D) When an elected candidate fails to qualify for the 73
office to which the candidate has been elected, the office shall 74
be filled as in the case of a vacancy. Until so filled, the 75
incumbent officer shall continue to hold office. This section 76
does not postpone the time for such election beyond that at 77
which it would have been held had no such vacancy occurred, or 78

affect the official term, or the time for the commencement 79
thereof, of any person elected to such office before the 80
occurrence of such vacancy. 81
Sec. 302.09. When a vacancy occurs in the board of county 82
commissioners or in the office of county auditor, county 83
treasurer, prosecuting attorney, clerk of the court of common 84
pleas, sheriff, county recorder, county engineer, or coroner 85
more than forty days before the next general election for state 86
and county officers, the vacancy shall be filled as provided for 87
in divisions (A) and (B) of section 305.02 of the Revised Code. 88
Sec. 305.02. (A) If a vacancy in the office of county 89
commissioner, prosecuting attorney, county auditor, county 90
treasurer, clerk of the court of common pleas, sheriff, county 91
recorder, county engineer, or coroner occurs more than forty 92
days before the next general election for state and county 93
officers, a successor shall be elected at such election for the 94
unexpired term unless such term expires within one year 95
immediately following the date of such general election. 96
In either event, the vacancy shall be filled as provided 97
in this section and the appointee shall hold office until a 98
successor is elected and qualified. 99
(B) If Subject to division (C) of this section, if a 100
vacancy occurs from any cause in any of the offices named in 101
division (A) of this section, then not later than forty-five 102
days after the vacancy occurs, a person shall be appointed to 103
hold the office and to perform the duties thereof until a 104
successor is elected and has qualified. The appointment shall be 105
made as follows: 106
(1) If the last occupant of the office was elected as a 107

H. B. No. 123 Page 5
As Introduced
partisan candidate, the county central committee of the 108
political party that nominated the last occupant of the office 109
for the current term shall make the appointment. However, if 110
such vacancy occurs because of the death, resignation, or 111
inability to take the office of an officer-elect whose term has 112
not yet begun, and the officer-elect was elected as a partisan 113
candidate, an appointment to take such office at the beginning 114
of the term shall be made by the central committee of the 115
political party that nominated the officer-elect as a candidate 116
for that office for that term. 117
A county central committee that makes an appointment under 118
division (B)(1) of this section shall meet for that purpose not 119
less than five nor more than forty-five days after the vacancy 120
occurs. Not less than four days before the date of such meeting 121
the chairperson or secretary of such central committee shall 122
send by first class mail to every member of such central 123
committee a written notice which shall state the time and place 124
of such meeting and the purpose thereof. A majority of the 125
members of the central committee present at such meeting may 126
make the appointment. 127
(2) If the last occupant of the office or the officer- 128
elect was elected to serve the current term as an independent 129
candidate, the board of county commissioners shall make the 130
appointment, except where the vacancy is in the office of county 131
commissioner, in which case the prosecuting attorney and the 132
remaining commissioners or a majority of them shall make the 133
appointment. 134
(C) In the case of a vacancy in the office of county 135
auditor or county treasurer, if no election is held to fill the 136

the board of county commissioners shall notify the person to 141
provide a copy of the person's certificate of election to the 142
board. Upon being presented with a copy of the person's 143
certificate of election, the board shall appoint the person to 144
the office for the remainder of the unexpired term. If the 145
person fails to qualify to hold the office for the remainder of 146

remainder of the unexpired term. 149

of the unexpired term under division (C)(3) of this section, the 160

remainder of the unexpired term. 171
(D) Appointments made under this section shall be 172
certified by the appointing county central committee or by the 173
