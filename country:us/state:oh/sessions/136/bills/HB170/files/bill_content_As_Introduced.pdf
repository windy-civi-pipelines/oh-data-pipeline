Sec. 1509.71. As used in sections 1509.71 to 1509.79 of 11
the Revised Code: 12
"Carbon dioxide" means naturally occurring, geologically 13
sourced, or anthropogenically sourced carbon dioxide including 14
its derivatives and all mixtures, combinations, and phases, 15
whether liquid, gaseous, solid, stripped, segregated, or divided 16
from any other fluid stream thereof. 17
"Carbon dioxide well" means a well that is used to inject 18
carbon dioxide into a reservoir for carbon sequestration under a 19
UIC Class VI permit. "Carbon dioxide well" shall be considered a 20

As Introduced
"well" for purposes of section 1509.01 of the Revised Code. 21
"Carbon dioxide plume" means the extent of an underground 22
injected carbon dioxide stream. 23
"Carbon sequestration" means the underground storage of 24
carbon dioxide in a geological formation. 25
"Carbon sequestration project" means a project that 26
involves the underground storage of carbon dioxide in a 27
geological formation pursuant to at least one UIC Class VI 28
permit. 29
"Owner" includes, unless the context indicates otherwise, 30
a person who has the right to drill a carbon dioxide well and to 31
inject carbon dioxide in an underground geologic formation. 32
"Owner," as defined in section 1509.01 of the Revised Code, does 33
not apply to sections 1509.71 to 1509.79 or sections 5301.58 to 34
5301.60 of the Revised Code unless the context indicates 35
otherwise. 36
"Pore space" means subsurface cavities and voids, whether 37
natural or artificially created, that are suitable for use as a 38
sequestration space for carbon dioxide. 39
"Storage facility" means the pore space in the subsurface 40
area consisting of the extent of a carbon dioxide plume and the 41
geological seals that confine the carbon dioxide plume that are 42
required to be delineated on an approved UIC Class VI permit or 43
an amendment to a UIC Class VI permit issued to a storage 44
operator. 45
"Storage operator" means an individual, corporation, or 46
other legal entity that operates a carbon sequestration project, 47

Sec. 1509.72. The division of oil and gas resources 60
management has sole and exclusive authority to regulate carbon 61
sequestration and the operation of storage facilities within the 62
state, excepting only those activities regulated under federal 63
laws for which oversight has been delegated to the environmental 64
protection agency and activities regulated under sections 65
6111.01 to 6111.028 of the Revised Code. The regulation of 66
carbon sequestration activities is a matter of general statewide 67
interest that requires uniform statewide regulation, and 68
sections 1509.71 to 1509.79 of the Revised Code and rules 69
adopted under those sections constitute a comprehensive plan 70
with respect to all aspects of carbon sequestration within this 71
state, including storage facility operation and permitting 72
related to those activities. 73
In order to assist the division in the furtherance of its 74
sole and exclusive authority as established in this section, the 75
chief of the division of oil and gas resources management may 76
enter into cooperative agreements with other state agencies 77
regarding carbon sequestration projects. Such cooperative 78
agreements do not confer on other state agencies any authority 79

to administer or enforce sections 1509.71 to 1509.79 of the 80
Revised Code and rules adopted under those sections. In 81
addition, such cooperative agreements shall not be construed to 82
dilute or diminish the division's sole and exclusive authority 83
as established in this section. 84
Nothing in this section affects the authority granted to 85
the director of transportation and local authorities in section 86
723.01 or 4513.34 of the Revised Code, provided that the 87
authority granted under those sections shall not be exercised in 88
a manner that discriminates against, unfairly impedes, or 89
obstructs carbon sequestration projects regulated under sections 90
1509.71 to 1509.79 of the Revised Code. 91
Sec. 1509.73. (A) The chief of the division of oil and ga s 92

(G) Storage facility operations conducted pursuant to an 342
order issued under this section constitute a fulfillment of all 343
the express or implied obligations of each lease or contract 344
covering lands in the storage facility to the extent that 345
compliance with such obligations cannot be had because of the 346
order of the chief. 347
Economic benefits allocated to any interest shall be the 348
property and income of the several persons to whom, or to whose 349
credit, the same are allocated or payable under the order 350
providing for storage facility operations. 351
(H) No order of the chief or other contract relating to 352
the pore space and the storage of carbon dioxide from a 353
separately owned interest shall be terminated by the order 354
providing for storage facility operations, but shall remain in 355
force until terminated in accordance with the provisions 356
thereof. 357
Except to the extent that the parties affected so agree, 358
no order providing for storage facility operations shall be 359
construed to result in a transfer of any person's title to all 360
or any part of the pore space in the storage facility. All 361
property, whether real or personal, that may be acquired for the 362
account of the owners within the storage facility shall be the 363
property of such owners in the proportion that the expenses of 364
operations are charged. 365

(2) The carbon capture administrative fund is created in 471
the state treasury. The fund shall consist of the money 472
collected under division (C)(1) of this section. The chief shall 473
use the funds for the purpose of administering sections 1509.71 474
to 1509.79 of the Revised Code and the rules adopted under those 475
sections that are associated with injection and sequestration of 476
carbon dioxide in a carbon dioxide well and for other purposes 477
determined by the chief. All interest earnings of the fund shall 478
be credited to the fund. 479
Sec. 5301.57. (A) As used in sections 5301.57 to 5301.60 480
of the Revised Code, "carbon dioxide," "carbon dioxide well," 481
"carbon sequestration," "owner," "pore space," "storage 482
operator," and "storage facility," have the same meanings as in 483

H. B. No. 170 Page 18
As Introduced
section 1509.71 of the Revised Code. 484
(B) As used in sections 5301.58 to 5301.60 of the Revised 485
Code, "subsurface property interest owner" means a property 486
interest owner identified by the records of the recorder of 487
deeds for each county in which a portion of a proposed storage 488
facility is located who holds a fee simple interest, other 489
freehold interest, or leasehold interest in the subsurface of 490
the property, which may include mineral rights, such as coal or 491
oil and gas rights. "Subsurface property interest owner" does 492
not include an owner who holds an interest in property 493
consisting solely of an easement or right-of-way. 494
Sec. 5301.58. (A) The ownership of all pore space in all 495
strata below the surface lands and waters is vested in the owner 496
of the surface directly above the pore space. 497
A conveyance of the surface ownership of real property 498
shall be a conveyance of the pore space in all strata below the 499
surface of the real property unless the ownership interest in 500
the pore space previously has been expressly excepted and 501
reserved, conveyed, or otherwise severed from the surface 502
ownership. The ownership of pore space in the strata may be 503
conveyed in the manner provided by law for the transfer of real 504
property interests. No agreement conveying mineral, oil and gas, 505
coal, limestone or similar resource, or other interests 506
underlying the surface shall convey pore space in the strata 507
unless the agreement expressly includes conveyance of the pore 508
space. 509
(B) No provision of law or rule requiring notice to be 510
given to a surface owner, owner of the mineral or oil and gas 511
interest, or both shall be construed to require notice to 512
individuals holding ownership interests in pore space in the 513

H. B. No. 170 Page 19
As Introduced
underlying strata unless the applicable law specifies notice to 514
the individuals is required or unless the owner of the pore 515
space also owns an interest in the surface or in the mineral or 516
oil and gas interests. 517
(C)(1) Nothing in sections 5301.58 to 5301.60 of the 518
Revised Code shall be construed to change or alter the common 519
law existing as of the effective date of this section with 520
respect to the rights belonging to, or the dominance of, the 521
mineral estate or oil and gas estate. For the purpose of 522
determining the priority of surface and subsurface uses between 523
a severed mineral or oil and gas estate and pore space, the 524
severed mineral or oil and gas estate is dominant regardless of 525
whether ownership of the pore space is vested in the owner of 526
the surface or is owned separately from the surface. 527
(2) If pore space is severed from the surface ownership, 528
the pore space estate shall be considered to be dominant over 529
the surface estate unless the conveyance specifically provides 530
otherwise. 531
(3) Nothing in sections 5301.58 to 5301.60 of the Revised 532
Code shall alter, amend, diminish, or invalidate rights to the 533
pore space that were acquired by deed, contract, or lease prior 534
to the effective date of this section. 535
(D) An instrument that transfers the rights to pore space 536
shall include a specific description of the location of the pore 537
space being transferred. In the event that the instrument uses 538
only a description of the surface, the transfer shall be 539
considered to include pore space owned by the transferor at all 540
depths underlying the described surface area unless specifically 541
excluded. The owner of the pore space shall have no right to use 542
the surface estate beyond that set out in a properly recorded 543

H. B. No. 170 Page 20
As Introduced
instrument due solely to its ownership in the pore space. 544
An instrument that conveys the surface directly above the 545
pore space, but otherwise seeks to except or reserve the rights 546
to the pore space, shall include a specific reference to the 547
pore space in the instrument. In the event of such exception or 548
reserved rights, the reserved rights to the pore space shall 549
include pore space owned by the transferor at all depths 550
underlying the described surface area unless otherwise 551
specifically excluded. 552
Sec. 5301.59. All carbon dioxide injected into a storage 553
facility for carbon sequestration, and all other substances 554
injected incidental to the injection of carbon dioxide, shall be 555
presumed to be owned by the storage operator. This presumption 556
may be rebutted by an individual claiming contrary ownership by 557
a preponderance of the evidence in an action to establish 558
ownership. 559
No owner of pore space, other individual holding any right 560
to control pore space, or other surface or subsurface property 561
interest owner, shall have any liability relating to the 562
injection of carbon dioxide, or any other substances injected 563
incidental to the injection of carbon dioxide, for carbon 564
sequestration activities solely by virtue of their interest in 565
the pore space or their surface or subsurface rights. 566
Sec. 5301.60. (A) A claim for damages due to injection or 567
migration of carbon dioxide shall not be recoverable against a 568
storage operator conducting carbon sequestration in accordance 569
with a valid UIC Class VI permit unless the claimant proves that 570
the injection or migration of carbon dioxide: 571
(1) Is injurious to health, or an obstruction to the free 572

H. B. No. 170 Page 21
As Introduced
use of property so as essentially to interfere with the 573
comfortable enjoyment of life or property; or 574
(2) Has caused direct physical injury to an individual, 575
animal, or real or personal property. 576
(B) A surface or subsurface property interest owner 577
asserting a claim for injury to personal or real property may 578
recover monetary damages due to injection or migration of carbon 579
dioxide only for the diminution in real or personal property 580
value resulting from the injection or migration of carbon 581
dioxide beyond the storage facility. 582
(C) A surface or subsurface property interest owner may 583
not seek punitive damages due to injection or migration of 584
carbon dioxide if the storage operator acts in compliance with 585
the requirements of the UIC Class VI permit. 586
(D) Divisions (A), (B), and (C) of this section do not 587
apply to any claims that may be asserted by owners of oil and 588
gas interests or owners of class II disposal wells for damages 589
or injuries related to: 590
(1) The injection or migration of carbon dioxide; 591
(2) The construction or operation of a storage facility; 592
or 593
(3) A carbon sequestration project. 594
