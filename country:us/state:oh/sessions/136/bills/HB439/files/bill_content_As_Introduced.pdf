where the supply has been substantially disrupted by 246
contamination, diminution, or interruption proximately resulting 247
from the owner's oil or gas operation, or the owner may elect to 248
compensate the holder of the interest in real property for the 249
difference between the fair market value of the interest before 250
the damage occurred to the water supply and the fair market 251
value after the damage occurred if the cost of replacing the 252
water supply exceeds this difference in fair market values. 253

H. B. No. 439 Page 10
As Introduced
division, the owner shall obtain for the holder or shall 255
reimburse the holder for the reasonable cost of obtaining a 256
water supply from the time of the contamination, diminution, or 257
interruption by the operation until the owner has complied with 258
an order of the chief for compliance with this division or such 259
an order has been revoked or otherwise becomes not effective. If 260
the owner elects to pay the difference in fair market values, 261
but the owner and the holder have not agreed on the difference 262
within thirty days after the chief issues an order for 263
compliance with this division, within ten days after the 264
expiration of that thirty-day period, the owner and the chief 265
each shall appoint an appraiser to determine the difference in 266
fair market values, except that the holder of the interest in 267
real property may elect to appoint and compensate the holder's 268
own appraiser, in which case the chief shall not appoint an 269
appraiser. The two appraisers appointed shall appoint a third 270
appraiser, and within thirty days after the appointment of the 271
third appraiser, the three appraisers shall hold a hearing to 272
determine the difference in fair market values. Within ten days 273
after the hearing, the appraisers shall make their determination 274
by majority vote and issue their final determination of the 275
difference in fair market values. The chief shall accept a 276
determination of the difference in fair market values made by 277
agreement of the owner and holder or by appraisers under this 278
division and shall make and dissolve orders accordingly. This 279
division does not affect in any way the right of any person to 280
enforce or protect, under applicable law, the person's interest 281
in water resources affected by an oil or gas operation. 282
(G) In any action brought by the state for a violation of 283
division (A) of this section involving any well at which annular 284
disposal is used, there shall be a rebuttable presumption 285

violation if the well is located within a one-quarter-mile 287
radius of the site of the violation. 288

Sec. 1509.224. (A) In addition to any other remedies 465
provided in this chapter, if the chief of the division of oil 466
and gas resources management has reason to believe that a 467
pattern of the same or similar violations of any requirements of 468
section 1509.22, 1509.222, or 1509.223 of the Revised Code, or 469
any rule adopted thereunder or term or condition of the 470
registration certificate issued thereunder exists or has 471
existed, and the violations are caused by the transporter's 472
indifference, lack of diligence, or lack of reasonable care, or 473
are willfully caused by the transporter, the chief shall 474
immediately issue an order to the transporter to show cause why 475
the certificate should not be suspended or revoked. After the 476
issuance of the order, the chief shall provide the transporter 477
an opportunity to be heard and to present evidence at an 478
informal hearing conducted by the chief. If, at the conclusion 479
of the hearing, the chief finds that such a pattern of 480
violations exists or has existed, the chief shall issue an order 481
suspending or revoking the transporter's registration 482
certificate. An order suspending or revoking a certificate under 483
this section may be appealed under sections 1509.36 and 1509.37 484

this chapter, may be appealed directly to the court of common 486

shall issue a preliminary order indicating the chief's intent to 496
issue a final order. The preliminary order shall clearly state 497
the nature of the chief's proposed action and the findings on 498
which it is based and shall state that the preliminary order 499
becomes a final order thirty days after its issuance unless the 500
person to whom the preliminary order is directed submits to the 501
chief a written request for an informal hearing before the chief 502
within that thirty-day period. At the hearing the person may 503
present evidence as to why the preliminary order should be 504
revoked or modified. Based upon the findings from the informal 505
hearing, the chief shall revoke, issue, or modify and issue the 506
