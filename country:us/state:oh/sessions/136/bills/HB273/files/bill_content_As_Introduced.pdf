Section 1. That sections 319.302, 323.152, and 4503.06 of 6
the Revised Code be amended to read as follows: 7
Sec. 319.302. (A)(1) Real property that is not intended 8

family, two-family, or three-family dwellings; leasing property 14
improved with single-family, two-family, or three-family 15
dwellings; or holding vacant land that the county auditor 16

used for the commercial production of timber that is receiving 22
the tax benefit under section 5713.23 or 5713.31 of the Revised 23
Code and all improvements connected with such commercial 24
production of timber. 25
(2) Each year, the county auditor shall review each parcel 26
of real property to determine whether it qualifies for the 27
partial exemption provided for by this section as of the first 28
day of January of the current tax year. 29
(B) After complying with section 319.301 of the Revised 30
Code, the county auditor shall reduce the remaining sums to be 31
levied by qualifying levies against each parcel of real property 32
that is listed on the general tax list and duplicate of real and 33
public utility property for the current tax year and that 34
qualifies for partial exemption under division (A) of this 35
section, and against each manufactured and mobile home that is 36
taxed pursuant to division (D)(2) of section 4503.06 of the 37
Revised Code and that is on the manufactured home tax list for 38
the current tax year, by ten per cent, to provide a partial 39
exemption for that parcel or home. For the purposes of this 40
division: 41
(1) "Qualifying levy" means a levy approved at an election 42
held before September 29, 2013; a levy within the ten-mill 43
limitation; a levy provided for by the charter of a municipal 44
corporation that was levied on the tax list for tax year 2013; a 45
subsequent renewal of any such levy; or a subsequent substitute 46
for such a levy under section 5705.199 of the Revised Code. 47
(2) "Qualifying levy" does not include any replacement 48
imposed under section 5705.192 of the Revised Code of any levy 49
described in division (B)(1) of this section. 50

(C) Except as otherwise provided in sections 323.152, 51
323.158, 323.16, 505.06, and 715.263 of the Revised Code, the 52
amount of the taxes remaining after any such reduction shall be 53
the real and public utility property taxes charged and payable 54
on each parcel of real property, including property that does 55
not qualify for partial exemption under division (A) of this 56
section, and the manufactured home tax charged and payable on 57
each manufactured or mobile home, and shall be the amounts 58
certified to the county treasurer for collection. Upon receipt 59
of the real and public utility property tax duplicate, the 60
treasurer shall certify to the tax commissioner the total amount 61
by which the real property taxes were reduced under this 62
section, as shown on the duplicate. Such reduction shall not 63
directly or indirectly affect the determination of the principal 64
amount of notes that may be issued in anticipation of any tax 65
levies or the amount of bonds or notes for any planned 66
improvements. If after application of sections 5705.31 and 67
5705.32 of the Revised Code and other applicable provisions of 68
law, including divisions (F) and (I) of section 321.24 of the 69
Revised Code, there would be insufficient funds for payment of 70
debt charges on bonds or notes payable from taxes reduced by 71
this section, the reduction of taxes provided for in this 72
section shall be adjusted to the extent necessary to provide 73
funds from such taxes. 74
(D) The tax commissioner may adopt rules governing the 75
administration of the partial exemption provided for by this 76
section. 77
(E) The determination of whether property qualifies for 78
partial exemption under division (A) of this section is solely 79
for the purpose of allowing the partial exemption under division 80
(B) of this section. 81

described in divisions (A)(1)(c)(ii) to (iv) of this section. 169
The reduction is in lieu of any reduction under section 323.158 170
of the Revised Code or division (A)(1), (2)(b), or (3) of this 171
section. The reduction applies to only one homestead owned and 172

treasurer, may order the time for payment of taxes to be 381
extended if the tax commissioner determines that penalties have 382
accrued or would otherwise accrue for reasons beyond the control 383

period. 386

shall be made in writing to the county treasurer. Failure to 420
receive a bill required by this section does not excuse failure 421
or delay to pay any taxes shown on the bill or, except as 422
provided in division (B)(1) of section 5715.39 of the Revised 423
Code, avoid any penalty, interest, or charge for such delay. 424

(2) of section 323.13 of the Revised Code shall also allow any 426
person required to receive a tax bill under division (D)(6)(a) 427
of this section to request electronic delivery of that tax bill 428
in the same manner. A person may rescind such a request in the 429
same manner as a request made under division (A)(2) of section 430
323.13 of the Revised Code. The request shall terminate upon a 431
change in the name of the person charged with the taxes pursuant 432
to section 4503.061 of the Revised Code. 433
(b) After delivery of the copy of the delinquent 434
manufactured home tax list under division (H) of this section, 435
the county treasurer may prepare and mail to each person in 436
whose name a home is listed an additional tax bill showing the 437
total amount of delinquent taxes charged against the home as 438
shown on the list. The tax bill shall include a notice that the 439
interest charge prescribed by division (G) of this section has 440
begun to accrue. 441
(7) Each tax bill prepared and mailed or delivered under 442
division (D)(6) of this section shall be in the form and contain 443
the information required by the tax commissioner. The 444
commissioner may prescribe different forms for each county and 445
may authorize the county auditor to make up tax bills and tax 446
receipts to be used by the county treasurer. The tax bill shall 447
not contain or be mailed or delivered with any information or 448
material that is not required by this section or that is not 449
authorized by section 321.45 of the Revised Code or by the tax 450
commissioner. In addition to the information required by the 451
commissioner, each tax bill shall contain the following 452
information: 453
(a) The taxes levied and the taxes charged and payable 454
against the manufactured or mobile home; 455

(b) The following notice: "Notice: If the taxes are not 456
paid within sixty days after the county auditor delivers the 457
delinquent manufactured home tax list to the county treasurer, 458
you and your home may be subject to collection proceedings for 459
tax delinquency." Failure to provide such notice has no effect 460
upon the validity of any tax judgment to which a home may be 461
subjected. 462
(c) In the case of manufactured or mobile homes taxed 463
under division (D)(2) of this section, the following additional 464
information: 465
(i) The effective tax rate. The words "effective tax rate" 466
shall appear in boldface type. 467
(ii) The following notice: "Notice: If the taxes charged 468
against this home have been reduced by the 2-1/2 per cent tax 469
reduction for residences occupied by the owner but the home is 470
not a residence occupied by the owner, the owner must notify the 471
county auditor's office not later than March 31 of the year for 472
which the taxes are due. Failure to do so may result in the 473
owner being convicted of a fourth degree misdemeanor, which is 474
punishable by imprisonment up to 30 days, a fine up to $250, or 475
both, and in the owner having to repay the amount by which the 476
taxes were erroneously or illegally reduced, plus any interest 477
that may apply. 478
If the taxes charged against this home have not been 479
reduced by the 2-1/2 per cent tax reduction and the home is a 480
residence occupied by the owner, the home may qualify for the 481
tax reduction. To obtain an application for the tax reduction or 482
further information, the owner may contact the county auditor's 483
office at __________ (insert the address and telephone number of 484
the county auditor's office)." 485

on or before the thirty-first day of July, next thereafter, or 546
on or before the last day for payment as extended pursuant to 547
section 4503.063 of the Revised Code, a like penalty shall be 548
charged on the balance of the total amount of the unpaid current 549
taxes. 550
(b) After a valid delinquent tax contract that includes 551
unpaid current taxes from a first-half collection period 552
described in division (F) of this section has been entered into 553
under section 323.31 of the Revised Code, no ten per cent 554
penalty shall be charged against such taxes after the second- 555
half collection period while the delinquent tax contract remains 556
in effect. On the day a delinquent tax contract becomes void, 557
the ten per cent penalty shall be charged against such taxes and 558
shall equal the amount of penalty that would have been charged 559
against unpaid current taxes outstanding on the date on which 560
the second-half penalty would have been charged thereon under 561
division (G)(1)(a) of this section if the contract had not been 562
in effect. 563
(2)(a) On the first day of the month following the last 564

beginning in 2000, interest shall be charged against and 566
computed on all delinquent taxes other than the current taxes 567

second installment could be paid without penalty. The charge 569
shall be for interest that accrued during the period that began 570
on the preceding first day of December and ended on the last day 571
of the month that included the last date such second installment 572
could be paid without penalty. The interest shall be computed at 573

Code and shall be entered as a separate item on the delinquent 575
manufactured home tax list compiled under division (H) of this 576
section. 577
(b) On the first day of December beginning in 2000, the 578
interest shall be charged against and computed on all delinquent 579
taxes. The charge shall be for interest that accrued during the 580
period that began on the first day of the month following the 581
last date prescribed for the payment of the second installment 582
of taxes in the current year and ended on the immediately 583
preceding last day of November. The interest shall be computed 584
at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the 585
Revised Code and shall be entered as a separate item on the 586
delinquent manufactured home tax list. 587
(c) After a valid undertaking has been entered into for 588
the payment of any delinquent taxes, no interest shall be 589
charged against such delinquent taxes while the undertaking 590
remains in effect in compliance with section 323.31 of the 591
Revised Code. If a valid undertaking becomes void, interest 592
shall be charged against the delinquent taxes for the periods 593
that interest was not permitted to be charged while the 594
undertaking was in effect. The interest shall be charged on the 595
day the undertaking becomes void and shall equal the amount of 596
interest that would have been charged against the unpaid 597
delinquent taxes outstanding on the dates on which interest 598
would have been charged thereon under divisions (G)(1) and (2) 599
of this section had the undertaking not been in effect. 600
(3) If the full amount of the taxes due at either of the 601
times prescribed by division (F) of this section is paid within 602
ten days after such time, the county treasurer shall waive the 603
collection of and the county auditor shall remit one-half of the 604

penalty provided for in this division for failure to make that 605
payment by the prescribed time. 606
(4) The treasurer shall compile and deliver to the county 607
auditor a list of all tax payments the treasurer has received as 608
provided in division (G)(3) of this section. The list shall 609
include any information required by the auditor for the 610
remission of the penalties waived by the treasurer. The taxes so 611
collected shall be included in the settlement next succeeding 612
the settlement then in process. 613
(H)(1) The county auditor shall compile annually a 614
"delinquent manufactured home tax list" consisting of homes the 615
county treasurer's records indicate have taxes that were not 616
paid within the time prescribed by divisions (D)(3) and (F) of 617
this section, have taxes that remain unpaid from prior years, or 618
have unpaid tax penalties or interest that have been assessed. 619
(2) Within thirty days after the settlement under division 620
(H)(2) of section 321.24 of the Revised Code, the county auditor 621
shall deliver a copy of the delinquent manufactured home tax 622
list to the county treasurer. The auditor shall update and 623
publish the delinquent manufactured home tax list annually in 624
the same manner as delinquent real property tax lists are 625
published. The county auditor may apportion the cost of 626
publishing the list among taxing districts in proportion to the 627
amount of delinquent manufactured home taxes so published that 628
each taxing district is entitled to receive upon collection of 629
those taxes, or the county auditor may charge the owner of a 630
home on the list a flat fee established under section 319.54 of 631
the Revised Code for the cost of publishing the list and, if the 632
fee is not paid, may place the fee upon the delinquent 633
manufactured home tax list as a lien on the listed home, to be 634

(3) When taxes, penalties, or interest are charged against 636
a person on the delinquent manufactured home tax list and are 637
not paid within sixty days after the list is delivered to the 638
county treasurer, the county treasurer shall, in addition to any 639
other remedy provided by law for the collection of taxes, 640
penalties, and interest, enforce collection of such taxes, 641
penalties, and interest by civil action in the name of the 642
treasurer against the owner for the recovery of the unpaid taxes 643
following the procedures for the recovery of delinquent real 644
property taxes in sections 323.25 to 323.28 of the Revised Code. 645
The action may be brought in municipal or county court, provided 646
the amount charged does not exceed the monetary limitations for 647
original jurisdiction for civil actions in those courts. 648
It is sufficient, having made proper parties to the suit, 649
for the county treasurer to allege in the treasurer's bill of 650
particulars or petition that the taxes stand chargeable on the 651
books of the county treasurer against such person, that they are 652
due and unpaid, and that such person is indebted in the amount 653
of taxes appearing to be due the county. The treasurer need not 654
set forth any other matter relating thereto. If it is found on 655
the trial of the action that the person is indebted to the 656
state, judgment shall be rendered in favor of the county 657
treasurer prosecuting the action. The judgment debtor is not 658
entitled to the benefit of any law for stay of execution or 659
exemption of property from levy or sale on execution in the 660
enforcement of the judgment. 661
Upon the filing of an entry of confirmation of sale or an 662
order of forfeiture in a proceeding brought under this division, 663
title to the manufactured or mobile home shall be in the 664

title to the purchaser upon presentation of proof of filing of 666
the entry of confirmation or order and, in the case of a 667
forfeiture, presentation of the county auditor's certificate of 668
sale. 669
(I) The total amount of taxes collected shall be 670
distributed in the following manner: four per cent shall be 671
allowed as compensation to the county auditor for the county 672
auditor's service in assessing the taxes; two per cent shall be 673
allowed as compensation to the county treasurer for the services 674
the county treasurer renders as a result of the tax levied by 675
this section. Such amounts shall be paid into the county 676
treasury, to the credit of the county general revenue fund, on 677
the warrant of the county auditor. Fees to be paid to the credit 678
of the real estate assessment fund shall be collected pursuant 679
to division (C) of section 319.54 of the Revised Code and paid 680
into the county treasury, on the warrant of the county auditor. 681
The balance of the taxes collected shall be distributed among 682
the taxing subdivisions of the county in which the taxes are 683
collected and paid in the same proportions that the amount of 684
manufactured home tax levied by each taxing subdivision of the 685
county in the current tax year bears to the amount of such tax 686
levied by all such subdivisions in the county in the current tax 687
year. The taxes levied and revenues collected under this section 688
shall be in lieu of any general property tax and any tax levied 689
with respect to the privilege of using or occupying a 690
manufactured or mobile home in this state except as provided in 691
sections 4503.04 and 5741.02 of the Revised Code. 692
(J) An agreement to purchase or a bill of sale for a 693
manufactured home shall show whether or not the furnishings and 694
equipment are included in the purchase price. 695

(K) If the county treasurer and the county prosecuting 696
attorney agree that an item charged on the delinquent 697
manufactured home tax list is uncollectible, they shall certify 698
that determination and the reasons to the county board of 699
revision. If the board determines the amount is uncollectible, 700
it shall certify its determination to the county auditor, who 701
shall strike the item from the list. 702
(L)(1) The county auditor shall appraise at its true value 703
any manufactured or mobile home in which ownership is 704
transferred or which first acquires situs in this state on or 705
after January 1, 2000, and any manufactured or mobile home the 706
owner of which has elected, under division (D)(4) of this 707
section, to have the home taxed under division (D)(2) of this 708
section. The true value shall include the value of the home, any 709
additions, and any fixtures, but not any furnishings in the 710
home. In determining the true value of a manufactured or mobile 711
home, the auditor shall consider all facts and circumstances 712
relating to the value of the home, including its age, its 713
capacity to function as a residence, any obsolete 714
characteristics, and other factors that may tend to prove its 715
true value. 716
(2)(a) If a manufactured or mobile home has been the 717
subject of an arm's length sale between a willing seller and a 718
willing buyer within a reasonable length of time prior to the 719
determination of true value, the county auditor shall consider 720
the sale price of the home to be the true value for taxation 721
purposes. 722
(b) The sale price in an arm's length transaction between 723
a willing seller and a willing buyer shall not be considered the 724
true value of the home if either of the following occurred after 725

H. B. No. 273 Page 27

the sale: 726
(i) The home has lost value due to a casualty. 727
(ii) An addition or fixture has been added to the home. 728
(3) The county auditor shall have each home viewed and 729
appraised at least once in each six-year period in the same year 730
in which real property in the county is appraised pursuant to 731
Chapter 5713. of the Revised Code, and shall update the 732
appraised values in the third calendar year following the 733
appraisal. The person viewing or appraising a home may enter the 734
home to determine by actual view any additions or fixtures that 735
have been added since the last appraisal. In conducting the 736
appraisals and establishing the true value, the auditor shall 737
follow the procedures set forth for appraising real property in 738
sections 5713.01 and 5713.03 of the Revised Code. 739
(4) The county auditor shall place the true value of each 740
home on the manufactured home tax list upon completion of an 741
appraisal. 742
(5)(a) If the county auditor changes the true value of a 743
home, the auditor shall notify the owner of the home in writing, 744
delivered by mail or in person. The notice shall be given at 745
least thirty days prior to the issuance of any tax bill that 746
reflects the change. Failure to receive the notice does not 747
invalidate any proceeding under this section. 748
(b) Any owner of a home or any other person or party that 749
would be authorized to file a complaint under division (A) of 750
section 5715.19 of the Revised Code if the home was real 751
property may file a complaint against the true value of the home 752
as appraised under this section. The complaint shall be filed 753
with the county auditor on or before the thirty-first day of 754

H. B. No. 273 Page 28
As Introduced
March of the current tax year or the date of closing of the 755
collection for the first half of manufactured home taxes for the 756
current tax year, whichever is later. The auditor shall present 757
to the county board of revision all complaints filed with the 758
auditor under this section. The board shall hear and investigate 759
the complaint and may take action on it as provided under 760
sections 5715.11 to 5715.19 of the Revised Code. 761
(c) If the county board of revision determines, pursuant 762
to a complaint against the valuation of a manufactured or mobile 763
home filed under this section, that the amount of taxes, 764
assessments, or other charges paid was in excess of the amount 765
due based on the valuation as finally determined, then the 766
overpayment shall be refunded in the manner prescribed in 767
section 5715.22 of the Revised Code. 768
(d) Payment of all or part of a tax under this section for 769
any year for which a complaint is pending before the county 770
board of revision does not abate the complaint or in any way 771
affect the hearing and determination thereof. 772
(M) If the county auditor determines that any tax or other 773
charge or any part thereof has been erroneously charged as a 774
result of a clerical error as defined in section 319.35 of the 775
Revised Code, the county auditor shall call the attention of the 776
county board of revision to the erroneous charges. If the board 777
finds that the taxes or other charges have been erroneously 778
charged or collected, it shall certify the finding to the 779
auditor. Upon receipt of the certification, the auditor shall 780
remove the erroneous charges on the manufactured home tax list 781
or delinquent manufactured home tax list in the same manner as 782
is prescribed in section 319.35 of the Revised Code for 783
erroneous charges against real property, and refund any 784

erroneous charges that have been collected, with interest, in 785
the same manner as is prescribed in section 319.36 of the 786
Revised Code for erroneous charges against real property. 787
(N) As used in this section and section 4503.061 of the 788
Revised Code: 789
(1) "Manufactured home taxes" includes taxes, penalties, 790
and interest charged under division (C) or (G) of this section 791
and any penalties charged under division (G) or (H)(5) of 792
section 4503.061 of the Revised Code. 793
(2) "Current taxes" means all manufactured home taxes 794
charged against a manufactured or mobile home that have not 795
appeared on the manufactured home tax list for any prior year. 796
Current taxes become delinquent taxes if they remain unpaid 797
after the last day prescribed for payment of the second 798
installment of current taxes without penalty, whether or not 799
they have been certified delinquent. 800
(3) "Delinquent taxes" means: 801

Section 3. The amendment by this act of sections 319.302, 815
323.152, and 4503.06 of the Revised Code applies, in the case of 816
property on the real property tax list, to tax years ending on 817

Section 4. Section 323.152 of the Revised Code is 821
presented in this act as a composite of the section as amended 822
by both H.B. 33 and S.B. 43 of the 135th General Assembly. The 823
General Assembly, applying the principle stated in division (B) 824
of section 1.52 of the Revised Code that amendments are to be 825
harmonized if reasonably capable of simultaneous operation, 826
finds that the composite is the resulting version of the section 827
