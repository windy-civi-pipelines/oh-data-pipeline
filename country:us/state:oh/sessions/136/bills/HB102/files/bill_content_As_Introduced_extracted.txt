the proper court and adjudged legal; 31
(5) When the defendant is an occupier of lands or 32
tenements, without color of title, and the complainant has the 33
right of possession to them; 34
(6) In any other case of the unlawful and forcible 35
detention of lands or tenements. For purposes of this division, 36

a municipal ordinance that is substantially similar to any 47
section in either of those chapters, which involves a controlled 48

the offense under Chapter 2925. or 3719. of the Revised Code or 66
the substantially similar municipal ordinance that occurred in, 67
is occurring in, or otherwise was or is connected with the 68
tenant's premises, and states the factual basis for the 69
affiant's belief that the controlled substances are located on 70
the tenant's premises; the warrant was properly executed by a 71
law enforcement officer and any controlled substance described 72
in the affidavit was found by that officer during the search and 73
seizure; and, subsequent to the search and seizure, the landlord 74
was informed by that or another law enforcement officer of the 75
fact that the tenant or person has or presently is engaged in a 76
violation as described in this division and it occurred in, is 77
occurring in, or otherwise was or is connected with the tenant's 78

described in division (A)(6)(a)(i) of this section. 86

Code. In those cases, the court has the authority to declare a 88

contract and to grant any other claims arising out of the 90
contract. 91
(8) Against tenants who have breached an obligation that 92
is imposed by section 5321.05 of the Revised Code, other than 93
the obligation specified in division (A)(9) of that section, and 94
that materially affects health and safety. Prior to the 95
commencement of an action under this division, notice shall be 96
given to the tenant and compliance secured with section 5321.11 97
of the Revised Code. 98
(9) Against tenants who have breached an obligation 99
imposed upon them by a written rental agreement; 100
(10) Against manufactured home park residents who have 101
defaulted in the payment of rent or breached the terms of a 102
rental agreement with a park operator. Nothing in this division 103
precludes the commencement of an action under division (A)(12) 104
of this section when the additional circumstances described in 105
that division apply. 106
