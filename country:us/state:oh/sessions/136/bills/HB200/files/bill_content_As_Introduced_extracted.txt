charge voted by its electorate or receives from special 1489
assessment or revenue bond collection. For the purposes of this 1490

budget commission at a public hearing held at least once in the 1678
year following the effective date of this amendment October 3, 1679
2023, and in every fifth year thereafter. The county budget 1680
commission shall provide reasonable advance notice of the 1681
hearing to all political subdivisions eligible to participate in 1682
the fund and shall take public testimony from any such political 1683
subdivision that wishes to testify. 1684
Any alternative method of apportionment adopted and 1685
approved under this division may be revised, amended, or 1686
repealed in the same manner as it may be adopted and approved. 1687
If an alternative method of apportionment adopted and approved 1688
under this division is repealed, the undivided local government 1689
fund of the county shall be apportioned among the subdivisions 1690
eligible to participate in the fund, commencing in the ensuing 1691
calendar year, under the apportionment provided in section 1692

Section 79:
5747.52 of the Revised Code, unless the repeal occurs by 1693
operation of division (C) of this section or a new method for 1694
apportionment of the fund is provided in the action of repeal. 1695
(C) This division applies only in counties in which the 1696
city, located wholly or partially in the county, with the 1697
greatest population has a population of twenty thousand or less 1698
and a population that is less than fifteen per cent of the total 1699
population of the county. In such a county, the legislative 1700
authorities or boards of township trustees of two or more 1701
participating political subdivisions, which together have a 1702
population residing in the county that is a majority of the 1703
H. B. No. 200 Page 59
As Introduced
total population of the county, each may adopt a resolution to 1704
exclude the approval otherwise required of the legislative 1705
authority of the city, located wholly or partially in the 1706
county, with the greatest population. All of the resolutions to 1707
exclude that approval shall be adopted not later than the first 1708
Monday of August of the year preceding the calendar year in 1709
which distributions are to be made under an alternative method 1710
of apportionment. 1711
A motion granting or denying approval of an alternative 1712
method of apportionment under this division shall be adopted by 1713
a majority vote of the members of the board of county 1714
commissioners and by a majority vote of a majority of the boards 1715
of township trustees and legislative authorities of the 1716
municipal corporations located wholly or partially in the 1717
county, other than the city, located wholly or partially in the 1718
county, with the greatest population, shall take effect 1719
immediately, and need not be published. The alternative method 1720
of apportionment under this division shall be adopted and 1721
approved annually, not later than the first Monday of August of 1722
the year preceding the calendar year in which distributions are 1723
to be made under it. A motion granting approval of an 1724
alternative method of apportionment under this division repeals 1725
any existing alternative method of apportionment, effective with 1726
distributions to be made from the fund in the ensuing calendar 1727
year. An alternative method of apportionment under this division 1728
shall not be revised or amended after the first Monday of August 1729
of the year preceding the calendar year in which distributions 1730
are to be made under it. 1731
(D) In determining an alternative method of apportionment 1732
authorized by this section, the county budget commission may 1733
include in the method any factor considered to be appropriate 1734

commission. 1736
(E) The limitations set forth in section 5747.51 of the 1737
Revised Code, stating the maximum amount that the county may 1738
receive from the undivided local government fund and the minimum 1739
amount the townships in counties having a population of less 1740
than one hundred thousand may receive from the fund, are 1741
applicable to any alternative method of apportionment authorized 1742
under this section. 1743
(F) On the basis of any alternative method of 1744
apportionment adopted and approved as authorized by this 1745

Section 80:
section, as certified by the auditor to the county treasurer, 1746
the county treasurer shall make distribution of the money in the 1747
undivided local government fund to each subdivision eligible to 1748
participate in the fund, and the auditor, when the amount of 1749
those shares is in the custody of the treasurer in the amounts 1750
so computed to be due the respective subdivisions, shall at the 1751
same time certify to the tax commissioner the percentage share 1752
of the county as a subdivision. All money received into the 1753
treasury of a subdivision from the undivided local government 1754
fund in a county treasury shall be paid into the general fund 1755
and used for the current operating expenses of the subdivision. 1756
If a municipal corporation maintains a municipal university, the 1757
university, when the board of trustees so requests the 1758
legislative authority of the municipal corporation, shall 1759
participate in the money apportioned to the municipal 1760
corporation from the total local government fund, however 1761
created and constituted, in the amount requested by the board of 1762
trustees, provided that amount does not exceed nine per cent of 1763
the total amount paid to the municipal corporation. 1764

and 5747.505 of the Revised Code be enacted to read as follows: 21
Sec. 2929.15. (A)(1) If Subject to section 2965.04 of the 22
Revised Code, if in sentencing an offender for a felony the 23
court is not required to impose a prison term, a mandatory 24
prison term, or a term of life imprisonment upon the offender, 25
the court may directly impose a sentence that consists of one or 26
more community control sanctions authorized pursuant to section 27
2929.16, 2929.17, or 2929.18 of the Revised Code. If the court 28
is sentencing an offender for a fourth degree felony OVI offense 29
under division (G)(1) of section 2929.13 of the Revised Code, in 30
addition to the mandatory term of local incarceration imposed 31
under that division and the mandatory fine required by division 32
(B)(3) of section 2929.18 of the Revised Code, the court may 33
impose upon the offender a community control sanction or 34
combination of community control sanctions in accordance with 35
sections 2929.16 and 2929.17 of the Revised Code. If the court 36
is sentencing an offender for a third or fourth degree felony 37
OVI offense under division (G)(2) of section 2929.13 of the 38
Revised Code, in addition to the mandatory prison term or 39
mandatory prison term and additional prison term imposed under 40
that division, the court also may impose upon the offender a 41
community control sanction or combination of community control 42
sanctions under section 2929.16 or 2929.17 of the Revised Code, 43
but the offender shall serve all of the prison terms so imposed 44
prior to serving the community control sanction. 45
The duration of all community control sanctions imposed on 46
an offender under this division shall not exceed five years. If 47
the offender absconds or otherwise leaves the jurisdiction of 48
the court in which the offender resides without obtaining 49
permission from the court or the offender's probation officer to 50

H. B. No. 200 Page 3
As Introduced
leave the jurisdiction of the court, or if the offender is 51
confined in any institution for the commission of any offense 52
while under a community control sanction, the period of the 53
community control sanction ceases to run until the offender is 54
brought before the court for its further action. If the court 55
sentences the offender to one or more nonresidential sanctions 56
under section 2929.17 of the Revised Code, the court shall 57
impose as a condition of the nonresidential sanctions that, 58
during the period of the sanctions, the offender must abide by 59
the law and must not leave the state without the permission of 60
the court or the offender's probation officer. The court may 61
impose any other conditions of release under a community control 62
sanction that the court considers appropriate, including, but 63
not limited to, requiring that the offender not ingest or be 64
injected with a drug of abuse and submit to random drug testing 65
as provided in division (D) of this section to determine whether 66
the offender ingested or was injected with a drug of abuse and 67
requiring that the results of the drug test indicate that the 68
offender did not ingest or was not injected with a drug of 69
abuse. 70
(2)(a) If a court sentences an offender to any community 71
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions 72
authorized pursuant to section 2929.16, 2929.17, or 2929.18 of 73
the Revised Code, the court shall place the offender under the 74
general control and supervision of a department of probation in 75
the county that serves the court for purposes of reporting to 76
the court a violation of any condition of the sanctions, any 77
condition of release under a community control sanction imposed 78
by the court, a violation of law, or the departure of the 79
offender from this state without the permission of the court or 80
the offender's probation officer. Alternatively, if the offender 81

H. B. No. 200 Page 4
As Introduced
resides in another county and a county department of probation 82
has been established in that county or that county is served by 83
a multicounty probation department established under section 84
2301.27 of the Revised Code, the court may request the court of 85

be reduced by the time that the offender spends in prison under 246
the prison term. By determination of the court, the offender 247
upon release from the prison term either shall continue serving 248
the remaining time under the community control sanction, as 249
reduced under this division, or shall have the community control 250
sanction terminated. 251

control sanction shall be credited against the offender's 256
reserved prison sentence, and the remaining time under that 257
residential community control sanction and under the reserved 258
prison sentence shall be reduced by the time that the offender 259
spends in prison under the prison term. By determination of the 260

the offender successfully spent under the sanction that was 276
initially imposed. Except as otherwise specified in this 277
division, the prison term imposed under this division and 278

fulfills the conditions of a sanction imposed pursuant to 289

Sec. 5747.505. As used in this section, "local government 1386
fund payments" has the same meaning as in section 5747.504 of 1387
the Revised Code. 1388
If a municipal corporation, township, or county is subject 1389
to more than one reduction required by sections 5747.502 and 1390
5747.504 of the Revised Code for the same month, the tax 1391
commissioner shall proceed in the following order, to the extent 1392
the reductions do not exceed the amount of local government fund 1393
payments the municipal corporation, township, or county would 1394
otherwise receive: 1395
(A) Apply any reduction required under division (C) of 1396
section 5747.504 of the Revised Code and deposit the amount of 1397
payments withheld to the general revenue fund under division (E) 1398
of that section; 1399
(B) Apply any reduction required under division (D) of 1400
section 5747.502 of the Revised Code and deposit the amount of 1401

transportation safety fund under division (F) of that section; 1403
(C) Apply any reduction required under division (C) of 1404
section 5747.502 of the Revised Code and deposit the amount of 1405
payments withheld to the municipal corporation, township, or 1406
county, as required by division (C)(4) of section 5747.502 of 1407
the Revised Code, and to the appropriate account of the Ohio 1408
highway and transportation safety fund under division (F) of 1409

Sec. 5747.51. (A) On or before the twenty-fifth day of 1411
July of each year, the tax commissioner shall make and certify 1412
to the county auditor of each county an estimate of the amount 1413
of the local government fund to be allocated to the undivided 1414

As Introduced
local government fund of each county for the ensuing calendar 1415
year, adjusting the total as required to account for 1416
subdivisions receiving local government funds under section 1417
5747.502 of the Revised Code. 1418
(B) At each annual regular session of the county budget 1419
commission convened pursuant to section 5705.27 of the Revised 1420
Code, each auditor shall present to the commission the 1421
certificate of the commissioner, the annual tax budget and 1422
estimates, and the records showing the action of the commission 1423
in its last preceding regular session. The commission, after 1424
extending to the representatives of each subdivision an 1425
opportunity to be heard, under oath administered by any member 1426
of the commission, and considering all the facts and information 1427
presented to it by the auditor, shall determine the amount of 1428
the undivided local government fund needed by and to be 1429
apportioned to each subdivision for current operating expenses, 1430
as shown in the tax budget of the subdivision. This 1431
determination shall be made pursuant to divisions (C) to (I) of 1432
this section, unless the commission has provided for a formula 1433
pursuant to section 5747.53 of the Revised Code. The 1434
commissioner shall reduce the amount of funds from the undivided 1435
local government fund to a subdivision required to receive 1436
reduced funds under section 5747.502 or 5747.504 of the Revised 1437
Code. 1438
Nothing in this section prevents the budget commission, 1439
for the purpose of apportioning the undivided local government 1440
fund, from inquiring into the claimed needs of any subdivision 1441
as stated in its tax budget, or from adjusting claimed needs to 1442
reflect actual needs. For the purposes of this section, "current 1443
operating expenses" means the lawful expenditures of a 1444
subdivision, except those for permanent improvements and except 1445

H. B. No. 200 Page 50

payments for interest, sinking fund, and retirement of bonds, 1446
notes, and certificates of indebtedness of the subdivision. 1447
(C) The commission shall determine the combined total of 1448
the estimated expenditures, including transfers, from the 1449
general fund and any special funds other than special funds 1450
established for road and bridge; street construction, 1451
maintenance, and repair; state highway improvement; and gas, 1452
water, sewer, and electric public utilities operated by a 1453
subdivision, as shown in the subdivision's tax budget for the 1454
ensuing calendar year. 1455
(D) From the combined total of expenditures calculated 1456
pursuant to division (C) of this section, the commission shall 1457
deduct the following expenditures, if included in these funds in 1458
the tax budget: 1459
(1) Expenditures for permanent improvements as defined in 1460
division (E) of section 5705.01 of the Revised Code; 1461
(2) In the case of counties and townships, transfers to 1462
the road and bridge fund, and in the case of municipalities, 1463
transfers to the street construction, maintenance, and repair 1464
fund and the state highway improvement fund; 1465
(3) Expenditures for the payment of debt charges; 1466
(4) Expenditures for the payment of judgments. 1467
(E) In addition to the deductions made pursuant to 1468
division (D) of this section, revenues accruing to the general 1469
fund and any special fund considered under division (C) of this 1470
section from the following sources shall be deducted from the 1471
combined total of expenditures calculated pursuant to division 1472
(C) of this section: 1473

As Introduced
(1) Taxes levied within the ten-mill limitation, as 1474
defined in section 5705.02 of the Revised Code; 1475
(2) The budget commission allocation of estimated county 1476
public library fund revenues to be distributed pursuant to 1477
section 5747.48 of the Revised Code; 1478
(3) Estimated unencumbered balances as shown on the tax 1479
budget as of the thirty-first day of December of the current 1480
year in the general fund, but not any estimated balance in any 1481
special fund considered in division (C) of this section; 1482
(4) Revenue, including transfers, shown in the general 1483
fund and any special funds other than special funds established 1484
for road and bridge; street construction, maintenance, and 1485
repair; state highway improvement; and gas, water, sewer, and 1486
electric public utilities, from all other sources except those 1487
that a subdivision receives from an additional tax or service 1488
charge voted by its electorate or receives from special 1489
assessment or revenue bond collection. For the purposes of this 1490
division, where the charter of a municipal corporation prohibits 1491
the levy of an income tax, an income tax levied by the 1492
legislative authority of such municipal corporation pursuant to 1493
an amendment of the charter of that municipal corporation to 1494
authorize such a levy represents an additional tax voted by the 1495
electorate of that municipal corporation. For the purposes of 1496
this division, any measure adopted by a board of county 1497
commissioners pursuant to section 322.02, 4504.02, or 5739.021 1498
of the Revised Code, including those measures upheld by the 1499
electorate in a referendum conducted pursuant to section 1500
322.021, 4504.021, or 5739.022 of the Revised Code, shall not be 1501
considered an additional tax voted by the electorate. 1502

balance or revenue under division (E)(3) or (4) of this section. 1507
Money in a reserve balance account established by a township 1508
under section 5705.132 of the Revised Code shall not be 1509
considered an unencumbered balance or revenue under division (E) 1510
(3) or (4) of this section. 1511
If a county, township, or municipal corporation has 1512
created and maintains a nonexpendable trust fund under section 1513
5705.131 of the Revised Code, the principal of the fund, and any 1514
additions to the principal arising from sources other than the 1515
reinvestment of investment earnings arising from such a fund, 1516
shall not be considered an unencumbered balance or revenue under 1517
division (E)(3) or (4) of this section. Only investment earnings 1518
arising from investment of the principal or investment of such 1519
additions to principal may be considered an unencumbered balance 1520
or revenue under those divisions. 1521
(F) The total expenditures calculated pursuant to division 1522
(C) of this section, less the deductions authorized in divisions 1523
(D) and (E) of this section, shall be known as the "relative 1524
need" of the subdivision, for the purposes of this section. 1525
(G) The budget commission shall total the relative need of 1526
all participating subdivisions in the county, and shall compute 1527
a relative need factor by dividing the total estimate of the 1528
undivided local government fund by the total relative need of 1529
all participating subdivisions. 1530
(H) The relative need of each subdivision shall be 1531
multiplied by the relative need factor to determine the 1532
proportionate share of the subdivision in the undivided local 1533

government fund of the county; provided, that the maximum 1534
proportionate share of a county shall not exceed the following 1535
maximum percentages of the total estimate of the undivided local 1536
government fund governed by the relationship of the percentage 1537
of the population of the county that resides within municipal 1538
corporations within the county to the total population of the 1539
county as reported in the reports on population in Ohio by the 1540
department of development as of the twentieth day of July of the 1541
year in which the tax budget is filed with the budget 1542
commission: 1543

A Percentage of municipal population Percentage share of the county
within the county: shall not exceed:
B Less than forty-one per cent Sixty per cent
C Forty-one per cent or more but less Fifty per cent
than eighty-one per cent
D Eighty-one per cent or more Thirty per cent
Where the proportionate share of the county exceeds the 1545
limitations established in this division, the budget commission 1546
shall adjust the proportionate shares determined pursuant to 1547
this division so that the proportionate share of the county does 1548
not exceed these limitations, and it shall increase the 1549
proportionate shares of all other subdivisions on a pro rata 1550
basis. In counties having a population of less than one hundred 1551
thousand, not less than ten per cent shall be distributed to the 1552
townships therein. 1553

As Introduced
(I) The proportionate share of each subdivision in the 1554
undivided local government fund determined pursuant to division 1555
(H) of this section for any calendar year shall not be less than 1556
the product of the average of the percentages of the undivided 1557
local government fund of the county as apportioned to that 1558
subdivision for the calendar years 1968, 1969, and 1970, 1559
multiplied by the total amount of the undivided local government 1560
fund of the county apportioned pursuant to former section 1561
5739.23 of the Revised Code for the calendar year 1970. For the 1562
purposes of this division, the total apportioned amount for the 1563
calendar year 1970 shall be the amount actually allocated to the 1564
county in 1970 from the state collected intangible tax as levied 1565
by section 5707.03 of the Revised Code and distributed pursuant 1566
to section 5725.24 of the Revised Code, plus the amount received 1567
by the county in the calendar year 1970 pursuant to division (B) 1568
(1) of former section 5739.21 of the Revised Code, and 1569
distributed pursuant to former section 5739.22 of the Revised 1570
Code. If the total amount of the undivided local government fund 1571
for any calendar year is less than the amount of the undivided 1572
local government fund apportioned pursuant to former section 1573
5739.23 of the Revised Code for the calendar year 1970, the 1574
minimum amount guaranteed to each subdivision for that calendar 1575
year pursuant to this division shall be reduced on a basis 1576
proportionate to the amount by which the amount of the undivided 1577
local government fund for that calendar year is less than the 1578
amount of the undivided local government fund apportioned for 1579
the calendar year 1970. 1580
(J) On the basis of such apportionment, the county auditor 1581
shall compute the percentage share of each such subdivision in 1582
the undivided local government fund and shall at the same time 1583
certify to the tax commissioner the percentage share of the 1584

county as a subdivision. No payment shall be made from the 1585
undivided local government fund, except in accordance with such 1586
percentage shares. 1587
Within ten days after the budget commission has made its 1588
apportionment, whether conducted pursuant to section 5747.51 or 1589
5747.53 of the Revised Code, the auditor shall publish a list of 1590
the subdivisions and the amount each is to receive from the 1591
undivided local government fund and the percentage share of each 1592
subdivision, in a newspaper or newspapers of countywide 1593
circulation, and send a copy of such allocation to the tax 1594
commissioner. 1595
The county auditor shall also send a copy of such 1596
allocation by ordinary or electronic mail to the fiscal officer 1597
of each subdivision entitled to participate in the allocation of 1598
the undivided local government fund of the county. This copy 1599
shall constitute the official notice of the commission action 1600
referred to in section 5705.37 of the Revised Code. 1601
All money received into the treasury of a subdivision from 1602
the undivided local government fund in a county treasury shall 1603
be paid into the general fund and used for the current operating 1604
expenses of the subdivision. 1605
If a municipal corporation maintains a municipal 1606
university, such municipal university, when the board of 1607
trustees so requests the legislative authority of the municipal 1608
corporation, shall participate in the money apportioned to such 1609
municipal corporation from the total local government fund, 1610
however created and constituted, in such amount as requested by 1611
the board of trustees, provided such sum does not exceed nine 1612
per cent of the total amount paid to the municipal corporation. 1613

If any public official fails to maintain the records 1614
required by sections 5747.50 to 5747.55 of the Revised Code or 1615
by the rules issued by the tax commissioner, the auditor of 1616
state, or the treasurer of state pursuant to such sections, or 1617
fails to comply with any law relating to the enforcement of such 1618
sections, the local government fund money allocated to the 1619
county may be withheld until such time as the public official 1620
has complied with such sections or such law or the rules issued 1621
pursuant thereto. 1622
Sec. 5747.53. (A) As used in this section: 1623
(1) "City, located wholly or partially in the county, with 1624
the greatest population" means the city, located wholly or 1625
partially in the county, with the greatest population residing 1626
in the county; however, if the county budget commission on or 1627
before January 1, 1998, adopted an alternative method of 1628
apportionment that was approved by the legislative authority of 1629
the city, located partially in the county, with the greatest 1630
population but not the greatest population residing in the 1631
county, "city, located wholly or partially in the county, with 1632
the greatest population" means the city, located wholly or 1633
partially in the county, with the greatest population whether 1634
residing in the county or not, if this alternative meaning is 1635
adopted by action of the board of county commissioners and a 1636
majority of the boards of township trustees and legislative 1637
authorities of municipal corporations located wholly or 1638
partially in the county. 1639
(2) "Participating political subdivision" means a 1640
municipal corporation or township that satisfies all of the 1641
following: 1642
(a) It is located wholly or partially in the county. 1643

H. B. No. 200 Page 57

(b) It is not the city, located wholly or partially in the 1644
county, with the greatest population. 1645
(c) Undivided local government fund moneys are apportioned 1646
to it under the county's alternative method or formula of 1647
apportionment in the current calendar year. 1648
(B) In lieu of the method of apportionment of the 1649
undivided local government fund of the county provided by 1650
section 5747.51 of the Revised Code, the county budget 1651
commission may provide for the apportionment of the fund under 1652
an alternative method or on a formula basis as authorized by 1653
this section. The commissioner shall reduce the amount of funds 1654
from the undivided local government fund to a subdivision 1655
required to receive reduced funds under section 5747.502 or 1656
5747.504 of the Revised Code. 1657
Except as otherwise provided in division (C) of this 1658
section, the alternative method of apportionment shall have 1659
first been approved by all of the following governmental units: 1660
the board of county commissioners; the legislative authority of 1661
the city, located wholly or partially in the county, with the 1662
greatest population; and a majority of the boards of township 1663
trustees and legislative authorities of municipal corporations, 1664
located wholly or partially in the county, excluding the 1665
legislative authority of the city, located wholly or partially 1666
in the county, with the greatest population. In granting or 1667
denying approval for an alternative method of apportionment, the 1668
board of county commissioners, boards of township trustees, and 1669
legislative authorities of municipal corporations shall act by 1670
motion. A motion to approve shall be passed upon a majority vote 1671
of the members of a board of county commissioners, board of 1672
township trustees, or legislative authority of a municipal 1673

corporation, shall take effect immediately, and need not be 1674
published. 1675
Any alternative method of apportionment adopted and 1676
approved under this division shall be reviewed by the county 1677
budget commission at a public hearing held at least once in the 1678
year following the effective date of this amendment October 3, 1679
2023, and in every fifth year thereafter. The county budget 1680
commission shall provide reasonable advance notice of the 1681
hearing to all political subdivisions eligible to participate in 1682
the fund and shall take public testimony from any such political 1683
subdivision that wishes to testify. 1684
Any alternative method of apportionment adopted and 1685
approved under this division may be revised, amended, or 1686
repealed in the same manner as it may be adopted and approved. 1687
If an alternative method of apportionment adopted and approved 1688
under this division is repealed, the undivided local government 1689
fund of the county shall be apportioned among the subdivisions 1690
eligible to participate in the fund, commencing in the ensuing 1691
calendar year, under the apportionment provided in section 1692
5747.52 of the Revised Code, unless the repeal occurs by 1693
operation of division (C) of this section or a new method for 1694
apportionment of the fund is provided in the action of repeal. 1695
(C) This division applies only in counties in which the 1696
city, located wholly or partially in the county, with the 1697
greatest population has a population of twenty thousand or less 1698
and a population that is less than fifteen per cent of the total 1699
population of the county. In such a county, the legislative 1700
authorities or boards of township trustees of two or more 1701
participating political subdivisions, which together have a 1702
population residing in the county that is a majority of the 1703

H. B. No. 200 Page 59
As Introduced
total population of the county, each may adopt a resolution to 1704
exclude the approval otherwise required of the legislative 1705
authority of the city, located wholly or partially in the 1706
county, with the greatest population. All of the resolutions to 1707
exclude that approval shall be adopted not later than the first 1708
Monday of August of the year preceding the calendar year in 1709
which distributions are to be made under an alternative method 1710
of apportionment. 1711
A motion granting or denying approval of an alternative 1712
method of apportionment under this division shall be adopted by 1713
a majority vote of the members of the board of county 1714
commissioners and by a majority vote of a majority of the boards 1715
of township trustees and legislative authorities of the 1716
municipal corporations located wholly or partially in the 1717
county, other than the city, located wholly or partially in the 1718
county, with the greatest population, shall take effect 1719
immediately, and need not be published. The alternative method 1720
of apportionment under this division shall be adopted and 1721
approved annually, not later than the first Monday of August of 1722
the year preceding the calendar year in which distributions are 1723
to be made under it. A motion granting approval of an 1724
alternative method of apportionment under this division repeals 1725
any existing alternative method of apportionment, effective with 1726
distributions to be made from the fund in the ensuing calendar 1727
year. An alternative method of apportionment under this division 1728
shall not be revised or amended after the first Monday of August 1729
of the year preceding the calendar year in which distributions 1730
are to be made under it. 1731
(D) In determining an alternative method of apportionment 1732
authorized by this section, the county budget commission may 1733
include in the method any factor considered to be appropriate 1734

commission. 1736
(E) The limitations set forth in section 5747.51 of the 1737
Revised Code, stating the maximum amount that the county may 1738
receive from the undivided local government fund and the minimum 1739
amount the townships in counties having a population of less 1740
than one hundred thousand may receive from the fund, are 1741
applicable to any alternative method of apportionment authorized 1742
under this section. 1743
(F) On the basis of any alternative method of 1744
apportionment adopted and approved as authorized by this 1745
section, as certified by the auditor to the county treasurer, 1746
the county treasurer shall make distribution of the money in the 1747
undivided local government fund to each subdivision eligible to 1748
participate in the fund, and the auditor, when the amount of 1749
those shares is in the custody of the treasurer in the amounts 1750
so computed to be due the respective subdivisions, shall at the 1751
same time certify to the tax commissioner the percentage share 1752
of the county as a subdivision. All money received into the 1753
treasury of a subdivision from the undivided local government 1754
fund in a county treasury shall be paid into the general fund 1755
and used for the current operating expenses of the subdivision. 1756
If a municipal corporation maintains a municipal university, the 1757
university, when the board of trustees so requests the 1758
legislative authority of the municipal corporation, shall 1759
participate in the money apportioned to the municipal 1760
corporation from the total local government fund, however 1761
created and constituted, in the amount requested by the board of 1762
trustees, provided that amount does not exceed nine per cent of 1763
the total amount paid to the municipal corporation. 1764
