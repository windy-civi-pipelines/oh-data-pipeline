our society was clearly evident in his personal sacrifices of time and 21
effort to his family, friends, and community. Giving generously of his 22
energy and abilities in all of his endeavors, he displayed exceptional 23
concern and insight, and his absence will be keenly felt; and 24
WHEREAS, A loving husband to his wife, Becky, a devoted father to 25
his two daughters, Jaclyn and Bethany, and a doting grandfather to his 26
three granddaughters, Scarlett, Lena, and Finley, Jack Cera always 27
used his talents to the benefit of others, and the warmth and 28
understanding he readily extended to those around him will stand as a 29
testament to his personal character and ethical center. Although the 30
void which his death has created can never be filled, the legacy of 31
care and commitment he established will surely live on; therefore be 32
it 33
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the Senate of the 136th General 34
Assembly of Ohio, in adopting this Resolution, pay tribute to the 35
memory of a truly honorable man, Jack Cera; and be it further 36
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit a duly 37
