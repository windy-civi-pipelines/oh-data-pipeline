Honoring the Meigs County Historical Society and
Museum on its Sesquicentennial.
WHEREAS, The members of the House of Representatives of the 136th 1
General Assembly of Ohio are pleased to congratulate the Meigs County 2
Historical Society and Museum on the auspicious occasion of its 3
One Hundred Fiftieth Anniversary, celebrated September 6, 2025; and 4
WHEREAS, Recognition of this prestigious milestone is, indeed, a 5
fitting time to pay tribute to the Meigs County Historical Society and 6
Museum for its exceptional endeavors. Organized in 1876 as the Meigs 7
County Pioneer and Historical Society, this fine nonprofit protects 8
local history and relics and conducts historical education and 9
research through publications, symposia, and special events, and it 10
also maintains a museum and a library; and 11
WHEREAS, Since its inception, the Meigs County Historical Society 12
and Museum has striven to preserve and promote the unique history of 13
the area. Indeed, the organization is to be commended for its 14
tremendous efforts to ensure that the important details of our past 15
are transmitted to succeeding generations for their reflection and 16
appreciation; and 17
WHEREAS, In this modern era, in which the durability of goods and 18
values is often measured in months and days rather than in years and 19
decades, it is not only enlightening but also satisfying to discover 20
that some representations of the past still stand for future 21
generations as a record of, and a monument to, previous achievements. 22
The Meigs County Historical Society and Museum has certainly made 23
positive contributions to our society, maintaining the rich heritage 24
of bygone days; therefore be it 25
