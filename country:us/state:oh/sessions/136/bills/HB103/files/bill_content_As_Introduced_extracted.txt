(2)(a) Real property taxes on a homestead owned and 86
occupied, or a homestead in a housing cooperative occupied, by a 87
disabled veteran shall be reduced for each year for which an 88
application for the reduction has been approved. The reduction 89
shall equal the product obtained by multiplying fifty thousand 90
dollars of the true value of the property in money, as adjusted 91

veteran dies; 113
(ii) For a surviving spouse described in division (L)(2) 114
of section 323.151 of the Revised Code, the first year on the 115
first day of January of which the total disability rating 116

or a homestead in a housing cooperative occupied, by the 122
surviving spouse of a public service officer killed in the line 123
of duty shall be reduced for each year for which an application 124
for the reduction has been approved. The reduction shall equal 125
the product obtained by multiplying fifty thousand dollars of 126
the true value of the property in money, as adjusted under 127
division (A)(1)(d) of this section, by the amounts described in 128
divisions (A)(1)(c)(ii) to (iv) of this section. The reduction 129
is in lieu of any reduction under section 323.158 of the Revised 130
Code or division (A)(1) or (2) of this section. The reduction 131

the surviving spouse dies or remarries. 136

Code, shall be reduced for each year for which an application 141
for the reduction has been approved. The amount of the reduction 142
shall equal two and one-half per cent of the amount of taxes to 143
be levied by qualifying levies on the homestead or the 144
manufactured or mobile home after applying section 319.301 of 145
the Revised Code. For the purposes of this division, "qualifying 146
levy" has the same meaning as in section 319.302 of the Revised 147
Code. 148
(C) The reductions granted by this section do not apply to 149
special assessments or respread of assessments levied against 150
the homestead, and if there is a transfer of ownership 151
subsequent to the filing of an application for a reduction in 152
taxes, such reductions are not forfeited for such year by virtue 153
of such transfer. 154
(D) The reductions in taxable value referred to in this 155

Section 6:
section shall be applied solely as a factor for the purpose of 156
computing the reduction of taxes under this section and shall 157
not affect the total value of property in any subdivision or 158
taxing district as listed and assessed for taxation on the tax 159
lists and duplicates, or any direct or indirect limitations on 160
indebtedness of a subdivision or taxing district. If after 161

reduction of taxes provided for in sections 323.151 to 323.159 167
of the Revised Code shall be proportionately adjusted to the 168
extent necessary to provide such funds from levies within the 169

(b) Real property taxes on a homestead owned and occupied, 20
or a homestead in a housing cooperative occupied, by a person to 21

for each year for which an application for the reduction has 23
been approved. The reduction shall equal one of the following 24
amounts, as applicable to the person: 25
(i) If the person received a reduction under division (A) 26
(1) of this section for tax year 2006, the greater of the 27

division (A)(1)(c) of this section; 29
(ii) If the person received, for any homestead, a 30
reduction under division (A)(1) of this section for tax year 31
2013 or under division (A) of section 4503.065 of the Revised 32
Code for tax year 2014 or the person is the surviving spouse of 33

of this section; 46

Revised Code, not to exceed thirty-five per cent; 49
(iii) The effective tax rate used to calculate the taxes 50
charged against the property for the current year, where 51
"effective tax rate" is defined as in section 323.08 of the 52
Revised Code; 53
(iv) The quantity equal to one minus the sum of the 54
percentage reductions in taxes received by the property for the 55
current tax year under section 319.302 of the Revised Code and 56
division (B) of section 323.152 of the Revised Code. 57
(d) The tax commissioner shall adjust the total income 58
threshold described in division (A)(1)(b)(iii) and the reduction 59
amounts described in divisions (A)(1)(c)(i), (A)(2), and (A)(3) 60
of this section by completing the following calculations in 61
September of each year: 62
(i) Determine the percentage increase in the gross 63
domestic product deflator determined by the bureau of economic 64
analysis of the United States department of commerce from the 65
first day of January of the preceding calendar year to the last 66
day of December of the preceding calendar year; 67
(ii) Multiply that percentage increase by the total income 68
threshold or reduction amount for the current tax year, as 69
applicable; 70
(iii) Add the resulting product to the total income 71
threshold or the reduction amount, as applicable, for the 72

H. B. No. 103 Page 4
As Introduced
current tax year; 73
(iv) Round the resulting sum to the nearest multiple of 74
one hundred dollars. 75
The commissioner shall certify the amount resulting from 76
each adjustment to each county auditor not later than the first 77
day of December each year. The certified total income threshold 78
amount applies to the following tax year for persons described 79
in division (A)(1)(b)(iii) of this section. The certified 80
reduction amount applies to the following tax year. The 81
commissioner shall not make the applicable adjustment in any 82
calendar year in which the amount resulting from the adjustment 83
would be less than the total income threshold or the reduction 84
amount for the current tax year. 85
(2)(a) Real property taxes on a homestead owned and 86
occupied, or a homestead in a housing cooperative occupied, by a 87
disabled veteran shall be reduced for each year for which an 88
application for the reduction has been approved. The reduction 89
shall equal the product obtained by multiplying fifty thousand 90
dollars of the true value of the property in money, as adjusted 91
under division (A)(1)(d) of this section, by the amounts 92
described in divisions (A)(1)(c)(ii) to (iv) of this section. 93
The reduction is in lieu of any reduction under section 323.158 94
of the Revised Code or division (A)(1), (2)(b), or (3) of this 95
section. The reduction applies to only one homestead owned and 96
occupied by a disabled veteran. 97
(b) Real property taxes on a homestead owned and occupied, 98
or a homestead in a housing cooperative occupied, by the 99
surviving spouse of a disabled veteran shall be reduced for each 100
year an application for exemption is approved. The reduction 101
shall equal to the amount of the reduction authorized under 102

H. B. No. 103 Page 5
As Introduced
division (A)(2)(a) of this section. 103
The reduction is in lieu of any reduction under section 104
323.158 of the Revised Code or division (A)(1), (2)(a), or (3) 105
of this section. The reduction applies to only one homestead 106
owned and occupied by the surviving spouse of a disabled 107
veteran. A homestead qualifies for a reduction in taxes under 108
division (A)(2)(b) of this section beginning in one of the 109
following tax years: 110
(i) For a surviving spouse described in division (L)(1) of 111
section 323.151 of the Revised Code, the year the disabled 112
veteran dies; 113
(ii) For a surviving spouse described in division (L)(2) 114
of section 323.151 of the Revised Code, the first year on the 115
first day of January of which the total disability rating 116
described in division (F) of that section has been received for 117
the deceased spouse. 118
In either case, the reduction shall continue through the 119
tax year in which the surviving spouse dies or remarries. 120
(3) Real property taxes on a homestead owned and occupied, 121
or a homestead in a housing cooperative occupied, by the 122
surviving spouse of a public service officer killed in the line 123
of duty shall be reduced for each year for which an application 124
for the reduction has been approved. The reduction shall equal 125
the product obtained by multiplying fifty thousand dollars of 126
the true value of the property in money, as adjusted under 127
division (A)(1)(d) of this section, by the amounts described in 128
divisions (A)(1)(c)(ii) to (iv) of this section. The reduction 129
is in lieu of any reduction under section 323.158 of the Revised 130
Code or division (A)(1) or (2) of this section. The reduction 131

H. B. No. 103 Page 6
As Introduced
applies to only one homestead owned and occupied by such a 132
surviving spouse. A homestead qualifies for a reduction in taxes 133
under division (A)(3) of this section for the tax year in which 134
the public service officer dies through the tax year in which 135
the surviving spouse dies or remarries. 136
(B) To provide a partial exemption, real property taxes on 137
any homestead, and manufactured home taxes on any manufactured 138
or mobile home on which a manufactured home tax is assessed 139
pursuant to division (D)(2) of section 4503.06 of the Revised 140
Code, shall be reduced for each year for which an application 141
for the reduction has been approved. The amount of the reduction 142
shall equal two and one-half per cent of the amount of taxes to 143
be levied by qualifying levies on the homestead or the 144
manufactured or mobile home after applying section 319.301 of 145
the Revised Code. For the purposes of this division, "qualifying 146
levy" has the same meaning as in section 319.302 of the Revised 147
Code. 148
(C) The reductions granted by this section do not apply to 149
special assessments or respread of assessments levied against 150
the homestead, and if there is a transfer of ownership 151
subsequent to the filing of an application for a reduction in 152
taxes, such reductions are not forfeited for such year by virtue 153
of such transfer. 154
(D) The reductions in taxable value referred to in this 155
section shall be applied solely as a factor for the purpose of 156
computing the reduction of taxes under this section and shall 157
not affect the total value of property in any subdivision or 158
taxing district as listed and assessed for taxation on the tax 159
lists and duplicates, or any direct or indirect limitations on 160
indebtedness of a subdivision or taxing district. If after 161

application of sections 5705.31 and 5705.32 of the Revised Code, 162
including the allocation of all levies within the ten-mill 163
limitation to debt charges to the extent therein provided, there 164
would be insufficient funds for payment of debt charges not 165
provided for by levies in excess of the ten-mill limitation, the 166
reduction of taxes provided for in sections 323.151 to 323.159 167
of the Revised Code shall be proportionately adjusted to the 168
extent necessary to provide such funds from levies within the 169
ten-mill limitation. 170
(E) No reduction shall be made on the taxes due on the 171
homestead of any person convicted of violating division (D) or 172
(E) of section 323.153 of the Revised Code for a period of three 173
years following the conviction. 174
Sec. 4503.065. (A)(1) Division (A) of this section applies 175
to any of the following persons: 176
(a) An individual who is permanently and totally disabled; 177
(b) An individual who is sixty-five years of age or older; 178
(c) An individual who is the surviving spouse of a 179
deceased person who was permanently and totally disabled or 180
sixty-five years of age or older and who applied and qualified 181
for a reduction in assessable value under this section in the 182
year of death, provided the surviving spouse is at least fifty- 183
nine but not sixty-five or more years of age on the date the 184
deceased spouse dies. 185
(2) The manufactured home tax on a manufactured or mobile 186
home that is paid pursuant to division (C) of section 4503.06 of 187
the Revised Code and that is owned and occupied as a home by an 188
individual whose domicile is in this state and to whom this 189
section applies, shall be reduced for any tax year for which an 190

individual did not acquire ownership from a person, other than 192
the individual's spouse, related by consanguinity or affinity 193
for the purpose of qualifying for the reduction. An owner 194
includes a settlor of a revocable or irrevocable inter vivos 195
trust holding the title to a manufactured or mobile home 196
occupied by the settlor as of right under the trust. 197

year. 292
(B)(1) The manufactured home tax levied pursuant to 293
division (C) of section 4503.06 of the Revised Code on a 294
manufactured or mobile home that is owned and occupied by a 295

(A)(2)(e) of this section, by the amounts described in divisions 365
(A)(2)(b)(ii) to (iv) of this section. 366
(2) For manufactured and mobile homes for which the tax 367
imposed by section 4503.06 of the Revised Code is computed under 368
division (D)(1) of that section, the reduction shall equal the 369
product obtained by multiplying fifty thousand dollars of the 370
cost to the owner, or the market value at the time of purchase, 371
whichever is greater, as those terms are used in division (D)(1) 372
of section 4503.06 of the Revised Code, as adjusted under 373
division (A)(2)(e) of this section, by the amounts described in 374
divisions (A)(2)(d)(ii) to (iv) of this section. 375
The reduction is in lieu of any reduction under section 376
4503.0610 of the Revised Code or division (A) or (B) of this 377
section. The reduction applies to only one manufactured or 378
mobile home owned and occupied by such a surviving spouse. A 379

under this division for the tax year in which the public service 381
officer dies through the tax year in which the surviving spouse 382
dies or remarries. 383
(D) If the owner or the spouse of the owner of a 384
manufactured or mobile home is eligible for a homestead 385
exemption on the land upon which the home is located, the 386
reduction to which the owner or spouse is entitled under this 387
section shall not exceed the difference between the reduction to 388
which the owner or spouse is entitled under division (A), (B), 389
or (C) of this section and the amount of the reduction under the 390
homestead exemption. 391
(E) No reduction shall be made with respect to the home of 392
any person convicted of violating division (C) or (D) of section 393
4503.066 of the Revised Code for a period of three years 394
