As Introduced
(b) The classification of amusement rides and rules for 136
the safe operation and inspection of all amusement rides as are 137
necessary for amusement ride safety and for the protection of 138
the general public. The classification of amusement rides must 139
identify those rides that need more comprehensive inspection and 140
testing in addition to regular state inspections, taking into 141
account hidden components integral to the safety of the ride. 142
(2)(a) Rules adopted by the director for the safe 143
operation and inspection of amusement rides shall be reasonable 144
and shall be based upon generally accepted engineering standards 145
and practices. The rules shall establish a minimum number of 146
inspections to be conducted on each ride depending on the size, 147
complexity, nature of the ride, and the number of days the ride 148
is in operation during the year for which the applicable permit 149
is valid. The rules also shall require the minimum number of 150
inspectors assigned to inspect a ride or rides to be reasonable 151
and adequate given the number, size, complexity, and nature of 152
the ride or rides. 153
(b) In adopting rules under this section, the director may 154
adopt by reference, in whole or in part, the national fire code 155

adopted in accordance with this division and division (B) of 172
section 993.08 of the Revised Code to be published in pamphlet 173
form and a copy to be furnished without charge to each owner of 174
an amusement ride who holds a current permit or is an applicant 175
therefor. 176
(C) With respect to an application for a permit for an 177
amusement ride, an owner may apply to the director for a waiver 178
or modification of any rule adopted under division (B) of this 179
section if there are practical difficulties or unnecessary 180
hardships for the amusement ride to comply with the rules. Any 181
application shall set forth the reasons for the request. The 182
director, with the approval of the advisory council on amusement 183
ride safety, may waive or modify the application of a rule to 184
any amusement ride if the public safety is secure. Any 185
authorization by the director under this division shall be in 186
writing and shall set forth the conditions under which the 187
waiver or modification is authorized, and the department shall 188
retain separate records of all proceedings under this division. 189
(D)(1) The director shall employ and provide for training 190
of a chief inspector and additional inspectors and employees as 191
may be necessary to administer and enforce this chapter. The 192

hired as an inspector, to complete the requirements for issuance 208
of a level one or higher inspector certification from NAARSO, 209
AIMS International, or another substantially equivalent 210
organization as determined by the director. 211
(2) No person shall inspect an amusement ride who, within 212
six months prior to the date of inspection, was an employee of 213
the owner of the ride. 214
(3) Before the director contracts with other persons to 215
inspect amusement rides, the director shall seek the advice of 216
the advisory council on amusement ride safety on whether to 217
contract with those persons. The advice shall not be binding 218
upon the director. After having received the advice of the 219
council, the director may proceed to contract with inspectors in 220
accordance with the procedures specified in division (E)(2) of 221

119. of the Revised Code establishing an annual fee that is less 236
than one hundred five dollars for an inspection and reinspection 237
of an inflatable ride. In adopting the rules, the director shall 238
ensure that the fee reasonably reflects the costs of inspection 239
and reinspection of an inflatable ride. If the director issues a 240
permit for an inflatable ride for a time period of less than one 241
year, the director shall charge a prorated fee for the permit 242
equal to one-twelfth of the annual permit fee multiplied by the 243
number of full months for which the permit is issued. 244
The fees for an expedited inspection, failure to cancel a 245
scheduled inspection, and failure to have an amusement ride 246
ready for inspection do not apply to go karts. 247
As used in division (E)(1) of this section, "expedited 248
inspection" means an inspection of an amusement ride by the 249

created, and shall be used only for the purpose of administering 256
and enforcing section 1711.11 of the Revised Code and this 257
chapter. 258
(3) The owner of an amusement ride shall be required to 259
pay a reinspection fee only if the reinspection is required by 260
division (B)(2) of this section or rules adopted under that 261
division, if the reinspection was conducted at the owner's 262
request under division (F) of this section, if the reinspection 263
is required by division (F) of this section because of an 264
accident, or if the reinspection is required by division (F) of 265

H. B. No. 433 Page 12
As Introduced
section 993.07 of the Revised Code. If a reinspection is 266
conducted at the request of the chief officer of a fair, 267
festival, or event where the ride is operating, the reinspection 268
fee shall be charged to the fair, festival, or event. 269
(4) The rules adopted under division (B) of this section 270

of determining the fees under division (E) of this section. The 275
rules shall define "other rides" to include go kart tracks. 276
(F) A reinspection of an amusement ride shall take place 277
if an accident occurs, if the owner of the ride or the chief 278
officer of the fair, festival, or event where the ride is 279
operating requests a reinspection, if the chief inspector 280
determines reinspection is necessary in accordance with section 281
993.042 of the Revised Code, or if the reinspection is required 282
by division (F) of section 993.07 of the Revised Code. 283
(G) As a supplement to its annual inspection of a 284
temporary amusement ride, the department may inspect the ride 285
during each scheduled event, as listed in the schedule of events 286
provided to the department by the owner pursuant to division (C) 287
of section 993.07 of the Revised Code, at which the ride is 288
operated in this state. These supplemental inspections are in 289
addition to any other inspection or reinspection of the ride as 290
may be required under this chapter or rules adopted under it, 291
and the owner of the temporary amusement ride is not required to 292
pay an inspection or reinspection fee for this supplemental 293
inspection unless the supplemental inspection is being conducted 294
pursuant to division (B)(2) of this section or rules adopted 295

under that division. Nothing in this division shall be construed 296
to prohibit the owner of a temporary amusement ride having a 297
valid permit to operate in this state from operating the ride at 298
a scheduled event before the department conducts a supplemental 299
inspection. 300
(H) The department may annually conduct a midseason 301
operational inspection of every amusement ride upon which it 302
conducts an annual inspection pursuant to division (A) of this 303
section. The midseason operational inspection is in addition to 304
any other inspection or reinspection of the amusement ride as 305
may be required pursuant to this chapter. The owner of an 306
amusement ride shall submit to the department, at the time 307
determined by the department, the midseason operational 308
inspection fee specified in division (E) of this section. The 309
director, in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code, 310
shall adopt rules specifying the time period during which the 311
department will conduct midseason operational inspections. 312
Section 2. That existing sections 993.01 and 993.04 of the 313
Revised Code are hereby repealed. 314
