BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF OHIO:
Section 1. That sections 319.302, 323.152, 323.156, 5
4503.065, and 4503.068 of the Revised Code be amended to read as 6
follows: 7
Sec. 319.302. (A)(1) Real property that is not intended 8
primarily for use in a business activity shall qualify for a 9
partial exemption from real property taxation. For purposes of 10
this partial exemption, "business activity" includes all uses of 11

with single-family, two-family, or three-family dwellings; or 15
holding vacant land that the county auditor determines will be 16

production of timber that is receiving the tax benefit under 20
section 5713.23 or 5713.31 of the Revised Code and all 21
improvements connected with such commercial production of 22
timber. 23
(2) Each year, the county auditor shall review each parcel 24
of real property to determine whether it qualifies for the 25
partial exemption provided for by this section as of the first 26
day of January of the current tax year. 27
(B) After complying with section 319.301 of the Revised 28
Code, the county auditor shall reduce the remaining sums to be 29
levied by qualifying levies against each parcel of real property 30
that is listed on the general tax list and duplicate of real and 31
public utility property for the current tax year and that 32
qualifies for partial exemption under division (A) of this 33
section, and against each manufactured and mobile home that is 34
taxed pursuant to division (D)(2) of section 4503.06 of the 35
Revised Code and that is on the manufactured home tax list for 36
the current tax year, by ten per cent, to provide a partial 37
exemption for that parcel or home. For the purposes of this 38
division: 39
(1) "Qualifying levy" means a levy approved at an election 40
held before September 29, 2013; a levy within the ten-mill 41
limitation; a levy provided for by the charter of a municipal 42
corporation that was levied on the tax list for tax year 2013; a 43
subsequent renewal of any such levy; or a subsequent substitute 44
for such a levy under section 5705.199 of the Revised Code. 45
(2) "Qualifying levy" does not include any replacement 46
imposed under section 5705.192 of the Revised Code of any levy 47
described in division (B)(1) of this section. 48

(C) Except as otherwise provided in sections 323.152, 49
323.158, 323.16, 505.06, and 715.263 of the Revised Code, the 50
amount of the taxes remaining after any such reduction shall be 51
the real and public utility property taxes charged and payable 52
on each parcel of real property, including property that does 53
not qualify for partial exemption under division (A) of this 54
section, and the manufactured home tax charged and payable on 55
each manufactured or mobile home, and shall be the amounts 56
certified to the county treasurer for collection. Upon receipt 57
of the real and public utility property tax duplicate, the 58
treasurer shall certify to the tax commissioner the total amount 59
by which the real property taxes were reduced under this 60
section, as shown on the duplicate. Such reduction shall not 61
directly or indirectly affect the determination of the principal 62
amount of notes that may be issued in anticipation of any tax 63
levies or the amount of bonds or notes for any planned 64
improvements. If after application of sections 5705.31 and 65
5705.32 of the Revised Code and other applicable provisions of 66
law, including divisions (F) and (I) of section 321.24 of the 67
Revised Code, there would be insufficient funds for payment of 68
debt charges on bonds or notes payable from taxes reduced by 69
this section, the reduction of taxes provided for in this 70
section shall be adjusted to the extent necessary to provide 71
funds from such taxes. 72
(D) The tax commissioner may adopt rules governing the 73
administration of the partial exemption provided for by this 74
section. 75
(E) The determination of whether property qualifies for 76
partial exemption under division (A) of this section is solely 77
for the purpose of allowing the partial exemption under division 78
(B) of this section. 79

section 323.151 of the Revised Code, the year the disabled 192
veteran dies; 193

or a homestead in a housing cooperative occupied, by the 202
surviving spouse of a public service officer killed in the line 203
of duty shall be reduced for each year for which an application 204
for the reduction has been approved. The reduction shall equal 205
the product obtained by multiplying fifty one thousand five 206
hundred dollars of the true value of the property in money, as 207
adjusted under division (A)(1)(d) of this section, by the 208
amounts described in divisions (A)(1)(c)(ii) to (iv) of this 209
section. The reduction is in lieu of any reduction under section 210
323.158 of the Revised Code or division (A)(1) or (2) of this 211
section. The reduction applies to only one homestead owned and 212
occupied by such a surviving spouse. A homestead qualifies for a 213

tax year in which the public service officer dies through the 215
tax year in which the surviving spouse dies or remarries. 216

shall equal two and one-half per cent of the amount of taxes to 223
be levied by qualifying levies on the homestead or the 224
manufactured or mobile home after applying section 319.301 of 225

special assessments or respread of assessments levied against 231
the homestead, and if there is a transfer of ownership 232
subsequent to the filing of an application for a reduction in 233
taxes, such reductions are not forfeited for such year by virtue 234
of such transfer. 235
(D) The reductions in taxable value referred to in this 236
section shall be applied solely as a factor for the purpose of 237
computing the reduction of taxes under this section and shall 238
not affect the total value of property in any subdivision or 239
taxing district as listed and assessed for taxation on the tax 240
lists and duplicates, or any direct or indirect limitations on 241
indebtedness of a subdivision or taxing district. If after 242
application of sections 5705.31 and 5705.32 of the Revised Code, 243
including the allocation of all levies within the ten-mill 244
limitation to debt charges to the extent therein provided, there 245
would be insufficient funds for payment of debt charges not 246
provided for by levies in excess of the ten-mill limitation, the 247
reduction of taxes provided for in sections 323.151 to 323.159 248
of the Revised Code shall be proportionately adjusted to the 249
extent necessary to provide such funds from levies within the 250
ten-mill limitation. 251

homestead of any person convicted of violating division (D) or 253
(E) of section 323.153 of the Revised Code for a period of three 254
years following the conviction. 255
