from a person, other than the applicant's spouse, related to the 437
owner by consanguinity or affinity for the purpose of qualifying 438
for the real property or manufactured home tax reduction 439

commissioner, who shall treat the full amount thereof as a 471
reduction in taxes for the preceding tax year and shall make 472

the property in the amount by which taxes were reduced under 495
that division for each tax year the county auditor ascertains 496

owned by the current owner or, in the case of a homestead in a 498
housing cooperative, occupied by the current occupant. Interest 499
shall accrue in the manner prescribed by division (B) of section 500
323.121 or division (G)(2) of section 4503.06 of the Revised 501
Code on the amount by which taxes were reduced for each such tax 502
year as if the reduction became delinquent taxes at the close of 503

could be paid without penalty. The county auditor shall notify 505
the owner or occupant, by ordinary mail, of the charge, of the 506
owner's or occupant's right to appeal the charge, and of the 507
manner in which the owner or occupant may appeal. The owner or 508

than the last day prescribed for payment of real and public 511
utility property taxes under section 323.12 of the Revised Code 512

the same manner as a complaint relating to the valuation or 515
assessment of real property under Chapter 5715. of the Revised 516
Code. The charge and any interest shall be collected as other 517
delinquent taxes. 518

under division (A) of section 323.152 of the Revised Code or to 530
which the occupant is entitled under section 323.159 of the 531

manufactured or mobile home that transferred during the 537
preceding calendar year and that qualified for and received a 538
reduction in taxes under division (B) of section 323.152 of the 539
Revised Code for the preceding tax year. In order to receive the 540
reduction under that division, the owner shall file the 541
application with the county auditor not later than the thirty- 542
first day of December. If the application is not timely filed, 543
the auditor shall not grant a reduction in taxes for the 544

the reduction in taxes has not been granted, in the same manner 546
prescribed under section 323.154 of the Revised Code for 547
notification of denial of an application. Failure of an owner to 548
receive an application does not excuse the failure of the owner 549
to file an original application. The county auditor is not 550
required to furnish an application under this paragraph for any 551
homestead for which application has previously been made on a 552
form incorporated into any form used by the county auditor to 553
administer the tax law in respect to the conveyance of real 554
property or of used manufactured homes or used mobile homes, and 555

such an investor or pass-through entity any additional deduction 1332
or credit, other than the credit provided by division (I) of 1333
this section, solely on account of the entity's filing a return 1334

(3) The election provided for under division (D) of this 1377
section applies only to the taxable year for which the election 1378
is made by the pass-through entity. Unless the tax commissioner 1379
provides otherwise, this election, once made, is binding and 1380
irrevocable for the taxable year for which the election is made. 1381
Nothing in this division shall be construed to provide for any 1382
deduction or credit that would not be allowable if a nonresident 1383
pass-through entity investor were to file an annual return. 1384
(4) If a pass-through entity makes the election provided 1385
for under division (D) of this section, the pass-through entity 1386
shall be liable for any additional taxes, interest, interest 1387
penalty, or penalties imposed by this chapter if the tax 1388
commissioner finds that the single return does not reflect the 1389
correct tax due by the pass-through entity investors covered by 1390
that return. Nothing in this division shall be construed to 1391
limit or alter the liability, if any, imposed on pass-through 1392
entity investors for unpaid or underpaid taxes, interest, 1393
interest penalty, or penalties as a result of the pass-through 1394
entity's making the election provided for under division (D) of 1395
this section. For the purposes of division (D) of this section, 1396

S. B. No. 195 Page 49
As Introduced
"correct tax due" means the tax that would have been paid by the 1397
pass-through entity had the single return been filed in a manner 1398
reflecting the commissioner's findings. Nothing in division (D) 1399
of this section shall be construed to make or hold a pass- 1400
through entity liable for tax attributable to a pass-through 1401
entity investor's income from a source other than the pass- 1402
through entity electing to file the single return. 1403
(E) If a husband and wife file a joint federal income tax 1404
return for a taxable year, they shall file a joint return under 1405
this section for that taxable year, and their liabilities are 1406
joint and several, but, if the federal income tax liability of 1407
either spouse is determined on a separate federal income tax 1408
return, they shall file separate returns under this section. 1409
If either spouse is not required to file a federal income 1410
tax return and either or both are required to file a return 1411
pursuant to this chapter, they may elect to file separate or 1412
joint returns, and, pursuant to that election, their liabilities 1413
are separate or joint and several. If a husband and wife file 1414
separate returns pursuant to this chapter, each must claim the 1415
taxpayer's own exemption, but not both, as authorized under 1416
section 5747.02 of the Revised Code on the taxpayer's own 1417
return. 1418
(F) Each return or notice required to be filed under this 1419
section shall contain the signature of the taxpayer or the 1420
taxpayer's duly authorized agent and of the person who prepared 1421
the return for the taxpayer, and shall include the taxpayer's 1422
social security number. Each return shall be verified by a 1423
declaration under the penalties of perjury. The tax commissioner 1424
shall prescribe the form that the signature and declaration 1425
shall take. 1426

(G) Each return or notice required to be filed under this 1427
section shall be made and filed as required by section 5747.04 1428
of the Revised Code, on or before the fifteenth day of April of 1429
each year, on forms that the tax commissioner shall prescribe, 1430
together with remittance made payable to the treasurer of state 1431
in the combined amount of the state and all school district 1432
income taxes shown to be due on the form. 1433
Upon good cause shown, the commissioner may extend the 1434
period for filing any notice or return required to be filed 1435
under this section and may adopt rules relating to extensions. 1436
If the extension results in an extension of time for the payment 1437
of any state or school district income tax liability with 1438
respect to which the return is filed, the taxpayer shall pay at 1439
the time the tax liability is paid an amount of interest 1440
computed at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of 1441
the Revised Code on that liability from the time that payment is 1442
due without extension to the time of actual payment. Except as 1443
provided in section 5747.132 of the Revised Code, in addition to 1444
all other interest charges and penalties, all taxes imposed 1445
under this chapter or Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code and 1446
remaining unpaid after they become due, except combined amounts 1447
due of one dollar or less, bear interest at the rate per annum 1448
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code until paid or 1449
until the day an assessment is issued under section 5747.13 of 1450
the Revised Code, whichever occurs first. 1451
If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to 1452
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by section 5747.02 of the 1453
Revised Code or any tax imposed under Chapter 5748. of the 1454
Revised Code, the commissioner may require returns and payments 1455
to be made otherwise than as provided in this section. 1456

To the extent that any provision in this division 1457
conflicts with any provision in section 5747.026 of the Revised 1458

(H) The amounts withheld pursuant to section 5747.06, 1460
5747.062, 5747.063, 5747.064, 5747.065, or 5747.071 of the 1461
Revised Code shall be allowed to the ultimate recipient of the 1462
income as credits against payment of the appropriate taxes 1463
imposed on the ultimate recipient by section 5747.02 and under 1464
Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code. As used in this division, 1465
"ultimate recipient" means the person who is required to report 1466
income from which amounts are withheld pursuant to section 1467
5747.06, 5747.062, 5747.063, 5747.064, 5747.065, or 5747.071 of 1468
the Revised Code on the annual return required to be filed under 1469
this section. 1470
(I) If a pass-through entity elects to file a single 1471
return under division (D) of this section and if any investor is 1472
required to file the annual return and make the payment of taxes 1473
required by this chapter on account of the investor's other 1474
income that is not included in a single return filed by a pass- 1475
through entity or any other investor elects to file the annual 1476
return, the investor is entitled to a refundable credit equal to 1477
the investor's proportionate share of the tax paid by the pass- 1478
through entity on behalf of the investor. The investor shall 1479
claim the credit for the investor's taxable year in which or 1480
with which ends the taxable year of the pass-through entity. 1481
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow any credit 1482
provided in this chapter to be claimed more than once. For the 1483
purpose of computing any interest, penalty, or interest penalty, 1484
the investor shall be deemed to have paid the refundable credit 1485
provided by this division on the day that the pass-through 1486
entity paid the estimated tax or the tax giving rise to the 1487

credit. 1488
(J) The tax commissioner shall ensure that each return 1489
required to be filed under this section includes a box that the 1490
taxpayer may check to authorize a paid tax preparer who prepared 1491
the return to communicate with the department of taxation about 1492
matters pertaining to the return. The return or instructions 1493
accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box 1494
the taxpayer authorizes the department of taxation to contact 1495
the preparer concerning questions that arise during the 1496
processing of the return and authorizes the preparer only to 1497
provide the department with information that is missing from the 1498
return, to contact the department for information about the 1499
processing of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund 1500
or payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical 1501
errors, offsets, or return preparation that the taxpayer has 1502
received from the department and has shown to the preparer. 1503
(K) The tax commissioner shall permit individual taxpayers 1504
to instruct the department of taxation to cause any refund of 1505
overpaid taxes to be deposited directly into a checking account, 1506
savings account, or an individual retirement account or 1507
individual retirement annuity, or preexisting college savings 1508
plan or program account offered by the Ohio tuition trust 1509
authority under Chapter 3334. of the Revised Code, as designated 1510
by the taxpayer, when the taxpayer files the annual return 1511
required by this section electronically. 1512
(L) If, for the taxable year, a nonresident or trust that 1513
is the owner of an electing pass-through entity, as defined in 1514
section 5747.38 of the Revised Code, does not have Ohio adjusted 1515
gross income or, in the case of a trust, modified Ohio taxable 1516

precludes such an owner from filing the annual return under this 1520
section, utilizing the refundable credit under section 5747.39 1521
of the Revised Code equal to the owner's proportionate share of 1522
the tax levied under section 5747.38 of the Revised Code and 1523

of taxes imposed under section 5747.02 of the Revised Code. 1525
