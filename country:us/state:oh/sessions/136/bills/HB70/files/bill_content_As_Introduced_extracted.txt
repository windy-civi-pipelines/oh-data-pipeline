to issue an electronic certificate of title. The fact that a 695
H. B. No. 70 Page 25

physical certificate of title is not issued for a motor vehicle 696
does not affect ownership of the vehicle. In that case, when the 697
clerk completes the process of entering certificate of title 698

system, the effect of the completion of the process is the same 700
as if the clerk actually issued a physical certificate of title 701
