not count toward limits on total eligible investment authority 311

contribution and the issuance of a tax credit certificate by the 355

agency of compliance with the recapture provisions of section 357
122.153 of the Revised Code. The tax credit issued under this 358
division is subject to recapture under section 122.153 of the 359
Revised Code. 360

under section 5725.98 or 5729.98 of the Revised Code as 362

carried forward for not more than four ensuing taxable years for 365
tax credits issued under program one and program two, and not 366
more than two ensuing taxable years for tax credits issued under 367

for the purposes of this section. The amount by which one or 465

investment in the same rural business concern for the purposes 477
of the limitations prescribed by division (C)(1) of this 478
section. 479
(2) The aggregate amount of growth investments by all 480

including amounts reinvested in a rural business concern 482
following a returned or repayment of a growth investment, shall 483

section. 488
(D) If the agency recaptures a tax credit under this 489
section, the agency shall notify the superintendent of insurance 490
of the recapture. The superintendent shall make an assessment 491
under Chapter 5725. or 5729. of the Revised Code for the amount 492
of the credit claimed by each certificate owner associated with 493
the fund before the recapture was finalized. The time 494
limitations on assessments under those chapters do not apply to 495
an assessment under this division, but the superintendent shall 496
make the assessment within one year after the date the agency 497
notifies the superintendent of the recapture. Following the 498
recapture of a tax credit under this section, no tax credit 499
certificate associated with the fund may be utilized. 500
Notwithstanding division (B) of section 122.152 of the Revised 501

date, a fund that has not committed any of the acts described in 507
division (B) of this section may apply to the agency to 508
decertify as a rural business growth fund. The agency shall 509
respond to the application within sixty days after receiving the 510
application. In evaluating the application, the fact that no tax 511
credit has been recaptured with respect to the fund shall be 512
sufficient evidence to prove that the fund is eligible for 513
decertification. The agency shall not unreasonably deny an 514
application submitted under this division. 515
(2) The agency shall send notice of its determination with 516
respect to an application submitted under division (E)(1) of 517

this section to the fund. If the application is denied, the 518

determination. 520
(3) The agency shall not recapture a tax credit due to any 521
actions of a fund that occur after the date the fund's 522
application for decertification is approved. Division (E)(3) of 523
this section does not prohibit the agency from recapturing a tax 524
credit due to the actions of a fund that occur before the date 525
the fund's application for decertification is approved, even if 526
those actions are discovered after that date. 527
Sec. 122.154. (A) Each rural business growth fund shall 528
submit a report to the department of development on or before 529
the first day of each March following the end of the calendar 530

after the fund has decertified. The report shall provide an 532
itemization of the fund's growth investments and shall include 533
the following documents and information: 534
(1) A bank statement evidencing each growth investment; 535
(2) The name, location, and industry class of each 536
business that received a growth investment from the fund and 537
evidence that the business qualified as a rural business concern 538
at the time the investment was made. If the fund obtained a 539
written opinion from the agency on the business's status as a 540
rural business concern under section 122.156 of the Revised 541
Code, or if the fund makes a written request for such an opinion 542
and the agency failed to respond within thirty days as required 543
by that section, a copy of the agency's favorable opinion or a 544
dated copy of the fund's unanswered request, as applicable, 545
shall be sufficient evidence that the business qualified as a 546
rural business concern at the time the investment was made. 547

the date the business received the growth investment; 550
(4) The number of new full-time equivalent employees 551
resulting from each of the fund's growth investments made or 552
maintained in the preceding calendar year; 553
(5) Any other information required by the agency. 554
(B) Each fund shall submit a report to the agency on or 555
before the fifth business day after the first, second, and for 556
program two and program three funds, third anniversaries of the 557
closing date that provides documentation sufficient to prove 558
that the fund has met the investment thresholds described in 559
division (A) of section 122.153 of the Revised Code and has not 560
implicated any of the other recapture provisions described in 561
division (B) of that section. 562
(C) Each certified rural business growth fund shall pay 563
the agency an annual fee of twenty thousand dollars. The initial 564
annual fee required of a fund shall be due and payable to the 565
agency along with the submission of documentation required under 566
division (H) of section 122.151 of the Revised Code. Each 567
subsequent annual fee is due and payable on the last day of 568
February following the first and each ensuing anniversary of the 569
closing date. If the fund is required to submit an annual report 570
under division (A) of this section, the annual fee shall be 571
submitted along with the report. No fund shall be required to 572
pay an annual fee after the fund has decertified under section 573
122.153 of the Revised Code. Annual fees paid to the agency 574
under this section shall be credited to the tax incentives 575
operating fund created under section 122.174 of the Revised 576
Code. 577

(D) The director of development, after consultation with 578
the superintendent of insurance and in accordance with Chapter 579
119. of the Revised Code, may adopt rules necessary to implement 580
sections 122.15 to 122.156 of the Revised Code. 581
Sec. 122.155. (A)(1) For each calendar year in which a 582
rural business growth fund makes or maintains a growth 583
investment in a rural business concern in this state, the fund 584
shall determine the number of new full-time equivalent employees 585
produced at the business concern as a result of the investment. 586
New full-time equivalent employees shall be computed by 587
subtracting the number of full-time equivalent employees at the 588
rural business concern on the date of the fund's initial growth 589
investment in the rural business concern from the number of 590
full-time equivalent employees at the rural business concern on 591
the last day of the calendar year. If the computation results in 592
a number less than zero, the number of new full-time equivalent 593
employees, produced by the fund's growth investment for that 594
calendar year period shall be zero. Only employees with an 595
hourly wage rate of at least one hundred fifty per cent of the 596
federal minimum wage may be considered in computing the number 597
of new full-time equivalent employees for the purposes of this 598
section. 599
(2) A fund may determine and include, for the purposes of 600
this section and section 122.154 of the Revised Code, the number 601
of new full-time equivalent employees produced at a rural 602
business concern after the year in which the fund's growth 603
investment is repaid or redeemed. The new full-time equivalent 604
employees shall be computed in the same manner as in division 605
(A)(1) of this section based on reporting information provided 606
by the rural business concern to the fund. 607

S. B. No. 110 Page 22

(B) After a fund's application for decertification is 608
approved under section 122.153 of the Revised Code, the fund 609
shall determine the state reimbursement amount. The state 610
reimbursement amount for program one and program two shall equal 611
the amount by which the fund's credit-eligible capital 612
contributions exceed the product obtained by multiplying thirty 613
thousand dollars by the aggregate number of new full-time 614
equivalent employees for the fund. The state reimbursement 615
amount for program three shall equal the amount by which the 616
fund's credit-eligible capital contributions exceed the product 617
obtained by multiplying thirty thousand dollars by the aggregate 618
number of new full-time equivalent employees for the fund for 619
investments located in tier one or tier two rural areas and by 620
multiplying sixty thousand dollars by the aggregate number of 621
new full-time equivalent employees for the fund for investments 622
located in tier three or tier four rural areas. If that product 623
is greater than the fund's credit-eligible capital 624
contributions, the state reimbursement amount shall equal zero. 625
In the absence of additional information provided by the fund or 626
discovered by the agency, the number of new full-time equivalent 627
employees for the purposes of this division equals the sum of 628
all new full-time equivalent employees reported by the fund on 629
the annual reports required under section 122.154 of the Revised 630
Code. 631
(C) After the state reimbursement amount is computed under 632
division (B) of this section, the fund shall not be permitted to 633
make further any distributions to equity holders of the fund, 634
including investors that are equity holders of the funds without 635
first remitting , in excess of the fund's net earnings or cause 636
the total amount of all distributions to exceed sixty per cent 637
of the fund's eligible investment authority, until the fund 638

S. B. No. 110 Page 23

remits the state reimbursement amount to the agency. All amounts 639
received by the agency under this division shall be credited to 640
the general revenue fund. 641
(D) The director of development services, upon the request 642
of a fund, may waive all or a portion of the remission required 643
under division (C) of this section if the director determines, 644
based on an affidavit of the chief executive officer or 645
president of a rural business concern, that the growth 646
investments of the fund resulted in the retention of employment 647
positions that would have otherwise been eliminated at rural 648
business concerns in this state. The amount waived shall not 649
exceed the product of thirty thousand dollars multiplied by the 650
number of retained employment positions multiplied by the number 651
of years in which the fund made or maintained a growth 652
investment in the rural business concern that retained the 653
employment positions. 654
Sec. 5725.98. (A) To provide a uniform procedure for 655
calculating the amount of tax imposed by section 5725.18 of the 656
