the individual to submit to a mental examination, physical 2194
examination, including an HIV test, or both a mental and a 2195
physical examination. The expense of the examination is the 2196

the allegations against the individual unless the failure is due 2200
to circumstances beyond the individual's control, and a default 2201

or any rule adopted under it. Any person may report to the board 2510
in a signed writing any information that the person may have 2511
that appears to show a violation of any provision of this 2512
chapter or any rule adopted under it. In the absence of bad 2513
faith, any person who reports information of that nature or who 2514
testifies before the board in any adjudication conducted under 2515
Chapter 119. of the Revised Code shall not be liable in damages 2516
in a civil action as a result of the report or testimony. Each 2517

shall be assigned a case number and shall be recorded by the 2519
board. 2520
(2) Investigations of alleged violations of this chapter 2521

except that a subpoena for patient record information shall not 2538
be issued without consultation with the attorney general's 2539
office and approval of the secretary of the board. 2540
(a) Before issuance of a subpoena for patient record 2541
information, the secretary shall determine whether there is 2542
probable cause to believe that the complaint filed alleges a 2543
violation of this chapter or any rule adopted under it and that 2544
the records sought are relevant to the alleged violation and 2545
material to the investigation. The subpoena may apply only to 2546
records that cover a reasonable period of time surrounding the 2547
alleged violation. 2548
(b) On failure to comply with any subpoena issued by the 2549
board and after reasonable notice to the person being 2550
subpoenaed, the board may move for an order compelling the 2551
production of persons or records pursuant to the Rules of Civil 2552
Procedure. 2553
(c) A subpoena issued by the board may be served by a 2554
sheriff, the sheriff's deputy, or a board employee or agent 2555
designated by the board. Service of a subpoena issued by the 2556
board may be made by delivering a copy of the subpoena to the 2557
person named therein, reading it to the person, or leaving it at 2558
the person's usual place of residence, usual place of business, 2559
or address on file with the board. When serving a subpoena to an 2560
applicant for or the holder of a license or certificate issued 2561
under this chapter, service of the subpoena may be made by 2562
certified mail, return receipt requested, and the subpoena shall 2563
be deemed served on the date delivery is made or the date the 2564

person refuses to accept delivery. If the person being served 2565
refuses to accept the subpoena or is not located, service may be 2566
made to an attorney who notifies the board that the attorney is 2567
representing the person. 2568
(d) A sheriff's deputy who serves a subpoena shall receive 2569
the same fees as a sheriff. Each witness who appears before the 2570
board in obedience to a subpoena shall receive the fees and 2571
mileage provided for under section 119.094 of the Revised Code. 2572
(4) All hearings, investigations, and inspections of the 2573
board shall be considered civil actions for the purposes of 2574
section 2305.252 of the Revised Code. 2575
(5) A report required to be submitted to the board under 2576
this chapter, a complaint, or information received by the board 2577
pursuant to an investigation or pursuant to an inspection under 2578
division (E) of section 4731.054 of the Revised Code is 2579
confidential and not subject to discovery in any civil action. 2580
The board shall conduct all investigations or inspections 2581
and proceedings in a manner that protects the confidentiality of 2582
patients and persons who file complaints with the board. The 2583
board shall not make public the names or any other identifying 2584
information about patients or complainants unless proper consent 2585
is given or, in the case of a patient, a waiver of the patient 2586
privilege exists under division (B) of section 2317.02 of the 2587
Revised Code, except that consent or a waiver of that nature is 2588
not required if the board possesses reliable and substantial 2589
evidence that no bona fide physician-patient relationship 2590
exists. 2591
The board may share any information it receives pursuant 2592
to an investigation or inspection, including patient records and 2593

H. B. No. 253 Page 91
As Introduced
patient record information, with law enforcement agencies, other 2594
licensing boards, and other governmental agencies that are 2595
prosecuting, adjudicating, or investigating alleged violations 2596
of statutes or administrative rules. An agency or board that 2597
receives the information shall comply with the same requirements 2598
regarding confidentiality as those with which the state medical 2599
board must comply, notwithstanding any conflicting provision of 2600
the Revised Code or procedure of the agency or board that 2601
applies when it is dealing with other information in its 2602
possession. In a judicial proceeding, the information may be 2603
admitted into evidence only in accordance with the Rules of 2604
Evidence, but the court shall require that appropriate measures 2605
are taken to ensure that confidentiality is maintained with 2606
respect to any part of the information that contains names or 2607
other identifying information about patients or complainants 2608
whose confidentiality was protected by the state medical board 2609
when the information was in the board's possession. Measures to 2610
ensure confidentiality that may be taken by the court include 2611
sealing its records or deleting specific information from its 2612
records. 2613
(6) On a quarterly basis, the board shall prepare a report 2614
that documents the disposition of all cases during the preceding 2615
three months. The report shall contain the following information 2616
for each case with which the board has completed its activities: 2617
(a) The case number assigned to the complaint or alleged 2618
violation; 2619
(b) The type of license or certificate to practice, if 2620
any, held by the individual against whom the complaint is 2621
directed; 2622
(c) A description of the allegations contained in the 2623

complaint; 2624
(d) The disposition of the case. 2625
The report shall state how many cases are still pending 2626
and shall be prepared in a manner that protects the identity of 2627
each person involved in each case. The report shall be a public 2628
record under section 149.43 of the Revised Code. 2629
(G) If the secretary and supervising member determine both 2630
of the following, they may recommend that the board suspend an 2631
individual's license or certificate to practice or certificate 2632
to recommend without a prior hearing: 2633
(1) That there is clear and convincing evidence that an 2634
individual has violated division (B) of this section; 2635
(2) That the individual's continued practice presents a 2636
danger of immediate and serious harm to the public. 2637
Written allegations shall be prepared for consideration by 2638
the board. The board, upon review of those allegations and by an 2639
affirmative vote of not fewer than six of its members, excluding 2640
the secretary and supervising member, may suspend a license or 2641
certificate without a prior hearing. A telephone conference call 2642
may be utilized for reviewing the allegations and taking the 2643
vote on the summary suspension. 2644
The board shall serve a written order of suspension in 2645
accordance with sections 119.05 and 119.07 of the Revised Code. 2646
The order shall not be subject to suspension by the court during 2647
pendency of any appeal filed under section 119.12 of the Revised 2648
Code. If the individual subject to the summary suspension 2649
requests an adjudicatory hearing by the board, the date set for 2650
the hearing shall be within fifteen days, but not earlier than 2651
seven days, after the individual requests the hearing, unless 2652

H. B. No. 253 Page 93

otherwise agreed to by both the board and the individual. 2653
Any summary suspension imposed under this division shall 2654
remain in effect, unless reversed on appeal, until a final 2655
adjudicative order issued by the board pursuant to this section 2656
and Chapter 119. of the Revised Code becomes effective. The 2657
board shall issue its final adjudicative order within seventy- 2658
five days after completion of its hearing. A failure to issue 2659
the order within seventy-five days shall result in dissolution 2660
of the summary suspension order but shall not invalidate any 2661
subsequent, final adjudicative order. 2662
(H) If the board takes action under division (B)(9), (11), 2663
or (13) of this section and the judicial finding of guilt, 2664
guilty plea, or judicial finding of eligibility for intervention 2665
in lieu of conviction is overturned on appeal, upon exhaustion 2666
of the criminal appeal, a petition for reconsideration of the 2667
order may be filed with the board along with appropriate court 2668
documents. Upon receipt of a petition of that nature and 2669
supporting court documents, the board shall reinstate the 2670
individual's license or certificate to practice. The board may 2671
then hold an adjudication under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code 2672
to determine whether the individual committed the act in 2673
question. Notice of an opportunity for a hearing shall be given 2674
in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code. If the 2675
board finds, pursuant to an adjudication held under this 2676
division, that the individual committed the act or if no hearing 2677
is requested, the board may order any of the sanctions 2678
identified under division (B) of this section. 2679
(I) The license or certificate to practice issued to an 2680
individual under this chapter and the individual's practice in 2681

individual's second or subsequent plea of guilty to, or judicial 2683
finding of guilt of, a violation of section 2919.123 or 2919.124 2684
of the Revised Code. In addition, the license or certificate to 2685
practice or certificate to recommend issued to an individual 2686
under this chapter and the individual's practice in this state 2687
are automatically suspended as of the date the individual pleads 2688
guilty to, is found by a judge or jury to be guilty of, or is 2689
subject to a judicial finding of eligibility for intervention in 2690
lieu of conviction in this state or treatment or intervention in 2691

practicing without a license or certificate. 2699
The board shall notify the individual subject to the 2700
suspension in accordance with sections 119.05 and 119.07 of the 2701
Revised Code. If an individual whose license or certificate is 2702
automatically suspended under this division fails to make a 2703
timely request for an adjudication under Chapter 119. of the 2704
Revised Code, the board shall do whichever of the following is 2705
applicable: 2706
(1) If the automatic suspension under this division is for 2707
a second or subsequent plea of guilty to, or judicial finding of 2708
guilt of, a violation of section 2919.123 or 2919.124 of the 2709
Revised Code, the board shall enter an order suspending the 2710
individual's license or certificate to practice for a period of 2711
at least one year or, if determined appropriate by the board, 2712
imposing a more serious sanction involving the individual's 2713

license or certificate to practice. 2714
(2) In all circumstances in which division (I)(1) of this 2715
section does not apply, enter a final order permanently revoking 2716
the individual's license or certificate to practice. 2717
(J) If the board is required by Chapter 119. of the 2718
Revised Code to give notice of an opportunity for a hearing and 2719
if the individual subject to the notice does not timely request 2720
a hearing in accordance with section 119.07 of the Revised Code, 2721
the board is not required to hold a hearing, but may adopt, by 2722
an affirmative vote of not fewer than six of its members, a 2723

order, the board may order any of the sanctions identified under 2725
division (A) or (B) of this section. 2726

this section resulting in a suspension from practice shall be 2728
accompanied by a written statement of the conditions under which 2729
the individual's license or certificate to practice may be 2730
reinstated. The board shall adopt rules governing conditions to 2731
be imposed for reinstatement. Reinstatement of a license or 2732
certificate suspended pursuant to division (B) of this section 2733
requires an affirmative vote of not fewer than six members of 2734
the board. 2735
(L) When the board refuses to grant or issue a license or 2736
certificate to practice to an applicant, revokes an individual's 2737
license or certificate to practice, refuses to renew an 2738
individual's license or certificate to practice, or refuses to 2739
reinstate an individual's license or certificate to practice, 2740
the board may specify that its action is permanent. An 2741
individual subject to a permanent action taken by the board is 2742
forever thereafter ineligible to hold a license or certificate 2743

this chapter shall not be effective unless or until accepted by 2750
the board. A telephone conference call may be utilized for 2751

certificate to practice. The telephone conference call shall be 2753
considered a special meeting under division (F) of section 2754

certificate to practice in accordance with this chapter or a 2762
certificate to recommend in accordance with rules adopted under 2763
section 4731.301 of the Revised Code does not remove or limit 2764

this section against the individual. 2766
(4) The placement of an individual's license on retired 2767
status, as described in section 4731.283 of the Revised Code, 2768

license as it existed before being placed on retired status. 2771

therein, reading it to the person, or leaving it at the person's 3439

file with the board. When serving a subpoena to an applicant for 3441
or the holder of a license or limited permit issued under this 3442
chapter, service of the subpoena may be made by certified mail, 3443
return receipt requested, and the subpoena shall be deemed 3444
served on the date delivery is made or the date the person 3445

an attorney who notifies the board that the attorney is 3448
representing the person. 3449
A sheriff's deputy who serves a subpoena shall receive the 3450
same fees as a sheriff. Each witness who appears before the 3451
board in obedience to a subpoena shall receive the fees and 3452

board refuses to ratify a consent agreement, the admissions and 3999

effect. 4001
A telephone conference call may be utilized for 4002

section 121.22 of the Revised Code. 4006
(B) The board shall not refuse to issue a license or 4007
limited permit to an applicant because of a plea of guilty to, a 4008

shall adopt rules governing conditions to be imposed for 4017
reinstatement. Reinstatement of a license or permit suspended 4018
pursuant to division (A) of this section requires an affirmative 4019
vote of not fewer than six members of the board. 4020
(D) When the board refuses to grant or issue a license or 4021
permit to an applicant, revokes an individual's license or 4022
permit, refuses to renew an individual's license or permit, or 4023
refuses to reinstate an individual's license or permit, the 4024
board may specify that its action is permanent. An individual 4025

or permit or for issuance of a new license or permit. 4029
(E) If the board is required by Chapter 119. of the 4030
Revised Code to give notice of an opportunity for a hearing and 4031
if the individual subject to the notice does not timely request 4032
a hearing in accordance with section 119.07 of the Revised Code, 4033
the board is not required to hold a hearing, but may adopt, by 4034
an affirmative vote of not fewer than six of its members, a 4035
final order that contains the board's findings. In the final 4036
order, the board may order any of the sanctions identified under 4037
division (A) of this section. 4038
(F) In enforcing division (A)(14) of this section, the 4039
board, upon a showing of a possible violation, shall refer any 4040
individual authorized to practice by this chapter or who has 4041
submitted an application pursuant to this chapter to the 4042
monitoring organization that conducts the confidential 4043
monitoring program established under section 4731.25 of the 4044
Revised Code. The board also may compel the individual to submit 4045
to a mental examination, physical examination, including an HIV 4046
test, or both a mental and a physical examination. The expense 4047
of the examination is the responsibility of the individual 4048
compelled to be examined. Failure to submit to a mental or 4049
physical examination or consent to an HIV test ordered by the 4050
board constitutes an admission of the allegations against the 4051
individual unless the failure is due to circumstances beyond the 4052
individual's control, and a default and final order may be 4053
entered without the taking of testimony or presentation of 4054
evidence. If the board finds an individual unable to practice 4055
because of the reasons set forth in division (A)(14) of this 4056
section, the board shall require the individual to submit to 4057
care, counseling, or treatment by physicians approved or 4058
designated by the board, as a condition for initial, continued, 4059

H. B. No. 253 Page 142

reinstated, or renewed authority to practice. An individual 4060
affected under this division shall be afforded an opportunity to 4061
demonstrate to the board the ability to resume practice in 4062
compliance with acceptable and prevailing standards under the 4063
provisions of the individual's license or permit. For the 4064
purpose of division (A)(14) of this section, any individual who 4065
applies for or receives a license or permit to practice under 4066
this chapter accepts the privilege of practicing in this state 4067
and, by so doing, shall be deemed to have given consent to 4068
submit to a mental or physical examination when directed to do 4069
so in writing by the board, and to have waived all objections to 4070
the admissibility of testimony or examination reports that 4071
constitute a privileged communication. 4072
(G) For the purposes of division (A)(18) of this section, 4073
any individual authorized to practice by this chapter accepts 4074
the privilege of practicing in this state subject to supervision 4075
by the board. By filing an application for or holding a license 4076
or permit under this chapter, an individual shall be deemed to 4077
have given consent to submit to a mental or physical examination 4078
when ordered to do so by the board in writing, and to have 4079
waived all objections to the admissibility of testimony or 4080
examination reports that constitute privileged communications. 4081
If it has reason to believe that any individual authorized 4082
to practice by this chapter or any applicant for a license or 4083
permit suffers such impairment, the board shall refer the 4084
individual to the monitoring organization that conducts the 4085
confidential monitoring program established under section 4086
4731.25 of the Revised Code. The board also may compel the 4087
individual to submit to a mental or physical examination, or 4088
both. The expense of the examination is the responsibility of 4089
the individual compelled to be examined. Any mental or physical 4090

H. B. No. 253 Page 143
As Introduced
examination required under this division shall be undertaken by 4091
a treatment provider or physician who is qualified to conduct 4092
the examination and who is approved under section 4731.251 of 4093
the Revised Code. 4094
Failure to submit to a mental or physical examination 4095
ordered by the board constitutes an admission of the allegations 4096
against the individual unless the failure is due to 4097
circumstances beyond the individual's control, and a default and 4098
final order may be entered without the taking of testimony or 4099
presentation of evidence. If the board determines that the 4100
individual's ability to practice is impaired, the board shall 4101
suspend the individual's license or permit or deny the 4102
individual's application and shall require the individual, as a 4103
condition for an initial, continued, reinstated, or renewed 4104
license or permit, to submit to treatment. 4105
Before being eligible to apply for reinstatement of a 4106
license or permit suspended under this division, the impaired 4107
practitioner shall demonstrate to the board the ability to 4108
resume practice in compliance with acceptable and prevailing 4109
standards of care under the provisions of the practitioner's 4110
license or permit. The demonstration shall include, but shall 4111
not be limited to, the following: 4112
(1) Certification from a treatment provider approved under 4113
section 4731.251 of the Revised Code that the individual has 4114
successfully completed any required inpatient treatment; 4115
(2) Evidence of continuing full compliance with an 4116
aftercare contract or consent agreement; 4117
(3) Two written reports indicating that the individual's 4118
ability to practice has been assessed and that the individual 4119

H. B. No. 253 Page 144
As Introduced
has been found capable of practicing according to acceptable and 4120
prevailing standards of care. The reports shall be made by 4121
individuals or providers approved by the board for making the 4122
assessments and shall describe the basis for their 4123
determination. 4124
The board may reinstate a license or permit suspended 4125
under this division after that demonstration and after the 4126
individual has entered into a written consent agreement. 4127
When the impaired practitioner resumes practice, the board 4128
shall require continued monitoring of the individual. The 4129
monitoring shall include, but not be limited to, compliance with 4130
the written consent agreement entered into before reinstatement 4131
or with conditions imposed by board order after a hearing, and, 4132
upon termination of the consent agreement, submission to the 4133
board for at least two years of annual written progress reports 4134
made under penalty of perjury stating whether the individual has 4135
maintained sobriety. 4136
(H)(1) If either of the following circumstances occur, the 4137
secretary and supervising member may recommend that the board 4138
suspend an individual's license or permit without a prior 4139
hearing: 4140
(a) The secretary and supervising member determine both of 4141
the following: 4142
(i) That there is clear and convincing evidence that an 4143
individual has violated division (A) of this section; 4144
(ii) That the individual's continued practice presents a 4145
danger of immediate and serious harm to the public. 4146
(b) The board receives verifiable information that a 4147
licensee has been charged in any state or federal court for a 4148

H. B. No. 253 Page 145
As Introduced
crime classified as a felony under the charging court's law and 4149
the conduct charged constitutes a violation of division (A) of 4150
this section. 4151
(2) If a recommendation is made to suspend without a prior 4152
hearing pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section, written 4153
allegations shall be prepared for consideration by the board. 4154
The board, upon review of those allegations and by an 4155
affirmative vote of not fewer than six of its members, excluding 4156
the secretary and supervising member, may suspend a license or 4157
permit without a prior hearing. A telephone conference call may 4158
be utilized for reviewing the allegations and taking the vote on 4159
the summary suspension. 4160
The board shall serve a written order of suspension in 4161
accordance with sections 119.05 and 119.07 of the Revised Code. 4162
The order shall not be subject to suspension by the court during 4163
pendency of any appeal filed under section 119.12 of the Revised 4164
Code. If the individual subject to the summary suspension 4165
requests an adjudicatory hearing by the board, the date set for 4166
the hearing shall be within fifteen days, but not earlier than 4167
seven days, after the individual requests the hearing, unless 4168
otherwise agreed to by both the board and the individual. 4169
(3) Any summary suspension imposed under this division 4170
shall remain in effect, unless reversed on appeal, until a final 4171
adjudicative order issued by the board pursuant to this section 4172
and Chapter 119. of the Revised Code becomes effective. The 4173
board shall issue its final adjudicative order within seventy- 4174
five days after completion of its hearing. A failure to issue 4175
the order within seventy-five days shall result in dissolution 4176
of the summary suspension order but shall not invalidate any 4177
subsequent, final adjudicative order. 4178

(I) For purposes of divisions (A)(2), (4), and (6) of this 4179
section, the commission of the act may be established by a 4180
finding by the board, pursuant to an adjudication under Chapter 4181
119. of the Revised Code, that the individual committed the act. 4182
The board does not have jurisdiction under those divisions if 4183
the trial court renders a final judgment in the individual's 4184
favor and that judgment is based upon an adjudication on the 4185
merits. The board has jurisdiction under those divisions if the 4186
trial court issues an order of dismissal upon technical or 4187
procedural grounds. 4188
(J) The sealing or expungement of conviction records by 4189
any court shall have no effect upon a prior board order entered 4190
under this section or upon the board's jurisdiction to take 4191
action under this section if, based upon a plea of guilty, a 4192
judicial finding of guilt, or a judicial finding of eligibility 4193
for intervention in lieu of conviction, the board issued a 4194
notice of opportunity for a hearing prior to the court's order 4195
to seal or expunge the records. The board shall not be required 4196
to seal, destroy, redact, or otherwise modify its records to 4197
reflect the court's sealing or expungement of conviction 4198
records. 4199
(K) If the board takes action under division (A)(1), (3), 4200
or (5) of this section, and the judicial finding of guilt, 4201
guilty plea, or judicial finding of eligibility for intervention 4202
in lieu of conviction is overturned on appeal, upon exhaustion 4203
of the criminal appeal, a petition for reconsideration of the 4204
order may be filed with the board along with appropriate court 4205
documents. Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration and 4206
supporting court documents, the board shall reinstate the 4207
individual's license or permit. The board may then hold an 4208
adjudication under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code to determine 4209

H. B. No. 253 Page 147
As Introduced
whether the individual committed the act in question. Notice of 4210
an opportunity for a hearing shall be given in accordance with 4211
Chapter 119. of the Revised Code. If the board finds, pursuant 4212
to an adjudication held under this division, that the individual 4213
committed the act or if no hearing is requested, the board may 4214
order any of the sanctions identified under division (A) of this 4215
section. 4216
(L) The license or permit issued to an individual under 4217
this chapter and the individual's practice in this state are 4218
automatically suspended as of the date the individual pleads 4219
guilty to, is found by a judge or jury to be guilty of, or is 4220

murder, murder, voluntary manslaughter, felonious assault, 4226
trafficking in persons, kidnapping, rape, sexual battery, gross 4227
sexual imposition, aggravated arson, aggravated robbery, or 4228
aggravated burglary. Continued practice after suspension shall 4229
be considered practicing without a license or permit. 4230
The board shall serve the individual subject to the 4231
suspension in accordance with sections 119.05 and 119.07 of the 4232
Revised Code. If an individual whose license or permit is 4233
automatically suspended under this division fails to make a 4234
timely request for an adjudication under Chapter 119. of the 4235
Revised Code, the board shall enter a final order permanently 4236
revoking the individual's license or permit. 4237
