employee or dependent, as applicable, has performed an act or 1457
practice that constitutes fraud or made an intentional 1458
misrepresentation of material fact under the terms of the 1459

is greater than the premium or contribution for a similarly 1470
situated individual covered under the policy on the basis of any 1471
health status-related factor in relation to the individual or to 1472
an individual covered under the policy as a dependent of the 1473

establishing premium discounts or rebates or modifying otherwise 1479
applicable copayments or deductibles in return for adherence to 1480
programs of health promotion and disease prevention. 1481

(C) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the 1517
contrary, a policy or plan shall be deemed to be in compliance 1518
with this section if the cost sharing imposed under such a 1519
policy or plan for orally administered cancer treatments does 1520
not exceed one hundred dollars per prescription fill. The cost - 1521
sharing limit of one hundred dollars per prescription fill shall 1522
apply to a high deductible plan, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 223, or 1523
a catastrophic plan, described in division (D)(2) of section 1524
3902.57 of the Revised Code and as defined in 42 U.S.C. 18022, 1525
only after the deductible has been met. 1526
(D)(1) The prohibitions in division (B) of this section do 1527
not preclude an individual or group policy of sickness and 1528
accident insurance or public employee benefit plan from 1529
requiring an insured or plan member to obtain prior 1530
authorization before orally administered cancer medication is 1531
dispensed to the insured or plan member. 1532

health care services to increase by more than one per cent per 1550
year. 1551
(2) The insurer or plan submits a signed letter from an 1552
independent member of the American academy of actuaries to the 1553

coverage of basic health care services. 1558

pursuant to divisions (E)(1) and (2) of this section: 1561

or plan's costs for claims and administrative expenses for the 1564

per cent per year. 1566
(ii) The increase in costs reasonably justifies an 1567
increase of more than one per cent in the annual premiums or 1568
rates charged by the insurer or plan for the coverage of basic 1569
health care services. 1570

(B)(1) Except as provided in section 2712(b) to (e) of the 1772
"Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996," 1773
if a carrier offers coverage in the small employer market in 1774
connection with a group health benefit plan, the carrier shall 1775
renew or continue in force such coverage at the option of the 1776

H. B. No. 438 Page 63
As Introduced
plan sponsor of the plan. 1777
(2) A carrier may cancel or decide not to renew the 1778
coverage of any eligible employee or of a dependent of an 1779
eligible employee if the employee or dependent, as applicable, 1780
has performed an act or practice that constitutes fraud or made 1781
an intentional misrepresentation of material fact under the 1782
terms of the coverage and if the cancellation or nonrenewal is 1783
not based, either directly or indirectly, on any health status- 1784
related factor in relation to the employee or dependent. 1785
As used in division (B)(A)(2) of this section, "health 1786
status-related factor" has the same meaning as in section 1787
3924.031 of the Revised Code. 1788
(C) (B) A carrier shall not exclude any eligible employee 1789
or dependent, who would otherwise be covered under a health 1790
benefit plan, on the basis of any actual or expected health 1791
condition of the employee or dependent. 1792
If, prior to November 24, 1995, a carrier excluded an 1793
eligible employee or dependent, other than a late enrollee, on 1794
the basis of an actual or expected health condition, the carrier 1795
shall, upon the initial renewal of the coverage on or after that 1796
date, extend coverage to the employee or dependent if all other 1797
eligibility requirements are met. 1798
(D) (C) No health benefit plan issued by a carrier shall 1799
limit or exclude, by use of a rider or amendment applicable to a 1800
specific individual, coverage by type of illness, treatment, 1801
medical condition, or accident, except for pre-existing 1802
conditions as permitted under division (A) of this section. If a 1803
health benefit plan that is delivered or issued for delivery 1804
prior to April 14, 1993, contains such limitations or 1805

H. B. No. 438 Page 64
As Introduced
exclusions, by use of a rider or amendment applicable to a 1806
specific individual, the plan shall eliminate the use of such 1807
riders or amendments within eighteen months after April 14, 1808
1993. 1809
(E)(D)(1) Except as provided in sections 3924.031 and 1810
3924.032 of the Revised Code, and subject to such rules as may 1811
be adopted by the superintendent of insurance in accordance with 1812
Chapter 119. of the Revised Code, a carrier shall offer and make 1813
available every health benefit plan that it is actively 1814
marketing to every small employer that applies to the carrier 1815
for such coverage. 1816
Division (E)(D)(1) of this section does not apply to a 1817
health benefit plan that a carrier makes available in the small 1818
employer market only through one or more bona fide associations. 1819
Division (E)(D)(1) of this section shall not be construed 1820
to preclude a carrier from establishing employer contribution 1821
rules or group participation rules for the offering of coverage 1822
in connection with a group health benefit plan in the small 1823
employer market, as allowed under the law of this state. As used 1824
in division (E)(D)(1) of this section, "employer contribution 1825
rule" means a requirement relating to the minimum level or 1826
amount of employer contribution toward the premium for 1827
enrollment of employees and dependents and "group participation 1828
rule" means a requirement relating to the minimum number of 1829
employees or dependents that must be enrolled in relation to a 1830
specified percentage or number of eligible individuals or 1831
employees of an employer. 1832
(2) Each health benefit plan, at the time of initial group 1833
enrollment, shall make coverage available to all the eligible 1834
employees of a small employer without a service waiting period. 1835

H. B. No. 438 Page 65
As Introduced
The decision of whether to impose a service waiting period shall 1836
be made by the small employer. Such waiting periods shall not be 1837
greater than ninety days. 1838
(3) Each health benefit plan shall provide for the special 1839
enrollment periods described in section 2701(f) of the "Health 1840
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996." 1841
(4) At least once in every twelve-month period, a carrier 1842
shall provide to all late enrollees who are identified by the 1843
small employer, the option to enroll in the health benefit plan. 1844
The enrollment option shall be provided for a minimum period of 1845
thirty consecutive days. All delays of coverage imposed under 1846
the health benefit plan, including any pre-existing condition 1847
exclusion period, affiliation period, or service waiting period, 1848
shall begin on the date the carrier receives notice of the late 1849
enrollee's application or request for coverage, and shall run 1850
concurrently with each other. 1851
(F) (E) The benefit structure of any health benefit plan 1852
may, at the time of coverage renewal, be changed by the carrier 1853
to make it consistent with the benefit structure contained in 1854
health benefit plans being marketed to new small employer 1855
groups. If the health benefit plan is available in the small 1856
employer market other than only through one or more bona fide 1857
associations, the modification must be consistent with the law 1858
of this state and effective on a uniform basis among small 1859
employer group plans. 1860
(G) (F) A carrier may obtain any facts and information 1861
necessary to apply this section, or supply those facts and 1862
information to any other third-party payer, without the consent 1863
of the beneficiary. Each person claiming benefits under a health 1864
benefit plan shall provide any facts and information necessary 1865

H. B. No. 438 Page 66
As Introduced
to apply this section. 1866
For purposes of this section, "bona fide association" 1867
means an association that has been actively in existence for at 1868
least five years; has been formed and maintained in good faith 1869
for purposes other than obtaining insurance; does not condition 1870
membership in the association on any health status-related 1871
factor, as defined in section 3924.031 of the Revised Code, 1872
relating to an individual, including an employee or dependent; 1873
makes health insurance coverage offered through the association 1874
available to all members regardless of any health status-related 1875
factor, as defined in section 3924.031 of the Revised Code, 1876
relating to such members or to individuals eligible for coverage 1877
through a member; does not make health insurance coverage 1878
offered through the association available other than in 1879
connection with a member of the association; and meets any other 1880
requirement imposed by the superintendent. To maintain its 1881
status as a "bona fide association," each association shall 1882
annually certify to the superintendent that it meets the 1883
requirements of this paragraph. 1884
Sec. 3924.033. (A) Each carrier, in connection with the 1885
offering of a health benefit plan to a small employer, shall 1886
disclose to the employer, as part of its solicitation and sales 1887
materials, the following information: 1888
(1) The provisions of the plan concerning the carrier's 1889
right to change premium rates and the factors that may affect 1890
changes in premium rates; 1891
(2) The provisions of the plan relating to renewability of 1892
coverage; 1893
(3) The provisions of the plan relating to any pre- 1894

H. B. No. 438 Page 67
As Introduced
existing condition exclusion; 1895
(4) The benefits and premiums available under all health 1896
benefit plans for which the employer is qualified. 1897
(B) The information described in division (A) of this 1898
section shall be provided in a manner determined to be 1899
understandable by the average small employer, and in a manner 1900
sufficient to reasonably inform a small employer regarding the 1901
employer's rights and obligations under the health benefit plan. 1902
(C) Nothing in this section requires a carrier to disclose 1903
any information that is by law proprietary and trade secret 1904
information. 1905
Sec. 3924.51. (A) As used in this section: 1906
(1) "Child" means, in connection with any adoption or 1907
placement for adoption of the child, an individual who has not 1908
attained age eighteen as of the date of the adoption or 1909
placement for adoption. 1910
(2) "Health insurer" has the same meaning as in section 1911
3924.41 of the Revised Code. 1912
(3) "Placement for adoption" means the assumption and 1913
retention by a person of a legal obligation for total or partial 1914
support of a child in anticipation of the adoption of the child. 1915
The child's placement with a person terminates upon the 1916
termination of that legal obligation. 1917
(B) If an individual or group health plan of a health 1918
insurer makes coverage available for dependent children of 1919
participants or beneficiaries, the plan shall provide benefits 1920
to dependent children placed with participants or beneficiaries 1921
for adoption under the same terms and conditions as apply to the 1922

H. B. No. 438 Page 68
As Introduced
natural, dependent children of the participants and 1923
beneficiaries, irrespective of whether the adoption has become 1924
final. 1925
(C) A health plan described in division (B) of this 1926
section shall not restrict coverage under the plan of any 1927
dependent child adopted by a participant or beneficiary, or 1928
placed with a participant or beneficiary for adoption, solely on 1929
the basis of a pre-existing condition of the child at the time 1930
that the child would otherwise become eligible for coverage 1931
under the plan, if the adoption or placement for adoption occurs 1932
while the participant or beneficiary is eligible for coverage 1933
under the plan. 1934
Sec. 4125.041. A shared employee under a professional 1935
employer organization agreement shall not, solely as a result of 1936
being a shared employee, be considered an employee of the 1937
professional employer organization for purposes of general 1938
liability insurance, fidelity bonds, surety bonds, employer 1939
liability not otherwise covered by Chapters 4121. and 4123. of 1940
the Revised Code, or liquor liability insurance carried by the 1941
professional employer organization, unless the professional 1942
employer organization agreement and applicable prearranged 1943
employment contract, insurance contract, or bond specifically 1944
states otherwise. 1945
A shared employee shall be considered an employee of the 1946
professional employer organization for purposes of determining 1947
whether a professional employer organization who sponsors a 1948
group health benefit plan is a small employer under division (M) 1949
(1)(L)(1) of section 3924.01 of the Revised Code. A fully 1950
insured health benefit plan sponsored by a professional employer 1951
organization is not subject to sections 3924.01 to 3924.06 of 1952

H. B. No. 438 Page 69
As Introduced
the Revised Code if the professional employer organization is 1953
not a small employer for purposes of those sections. 1954
Section 2. That existing sections 1731.04, 1751.01, 1955
1751.06, 1751.12, 1751.18, 1751.58, 1751.69, 3902.50, 3922.01, 1956

3924.51, and 4125.041 of the Revised Code are hereby repealed. 1958
Section 3. This act shall apply to health benefit plans, 1959
as defined in section 3922.01 of the Revised Code, delivered, 1960
issued for delivery, modified, or renewed on or after the 1961
effective date of this act. 1962
Section 4. This act shall be known as the Fair Access to 1963
Medical Insurance for Local Youth and Families (FAMILY) Act. 1964
Section 5. Section 1751.12 of the Revised Code is 1965
presented in this act as a composite of the section as amended 1966
by both H.B. 3 and H.B. 59 of the 130th General Assembly. The 1967
General Assembly, applying the principle stated in division (B) 1968
of section 1.52 of the Revised Code that amendments are to be 1969
harmonized if reasonably capable of simultaneous operation, 1970
finds that the composite is the resulting version of the section 1971
in effect prior to the effective date of the section as 1972
presented in this act. 1973
