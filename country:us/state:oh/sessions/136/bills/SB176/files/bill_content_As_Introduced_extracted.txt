Sec. 1350.011. In November, or as soon as practicable 120
thereafter, each year that begins after the effective date of 121
this section, the director of commerce shall increase or 122
decrease the value threshold above which a product may qualify 123
as digital electronic equipment by multiplying the value 124

urban consumers) prepared by the bureau of labor statistics of 127
the United States department of labor for the twelve-month 128
period ending on the immediately preceding thirtieth day of 129
September. The amount resulting from the computation, rounded to 130
the nearest one cent, applies to the following calendar year. 131
The director shall publish on a web site maintained by the 132
department of commerce the adjusted amount and the dates to 133
which that amount applies. 134
