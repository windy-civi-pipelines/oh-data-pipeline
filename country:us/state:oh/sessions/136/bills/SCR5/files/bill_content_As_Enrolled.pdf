(136th General Assembly)
(Senate Concurrent Resolution Number 5)
A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
To urge the President of the United States to support the Ohio Department of
Medicaid's request to implement work requirements for certain Medicaid
recipients.
Be it resolved by the Senate of the State of Ohio (The House of Representatives concurring):
WHEREAS, H.B. 49 of the 132nd General Assembly required the Medicaid Director to seek
approval from the United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to impose work
requirements for certain Medicaid recipients; and
WHEREAS, The Ohio Department of Medicaid and Medicaid Director submitted to CMS in
April 2018 a "Group VIII Work Requirement and Community Engagement 1115 Demonstration
Waiver Application" to authorize the state to require all new adult expansion group beneficiaries,
ages 19 through 49, with certain exemptions, to participate in and timely report 80 hours per month
of qualifying community engagement activities, such as employment, education, or job skills
training, as a condition of continued Medicaid eligibility; and
WHEREAS, CMS approved the request in March 2019, but before the Section 1115
demonstration waiver could be implemented, CMS withdrew its approval in August 2021; and
WHEREAS, H.B 33 of the 135th General Assembly requires the Medicaid Director, between
February 1, 2025, and March 1, 2025, to apply to CMS for a new approval to implement work
requirements for the Medicaid expansion eligibility group; and
WHEREAS, The Department of Medicaid and Medicaid Director recently published a Public
Notice and Request for Comment on a "Group VIII 1115 Demonstration Waiver Application"
intended for submission to CMS in February 2025; and
WHEREAS, Governor Mike DeWine has stated that implementing Medicaid work
requirements is consistent with the state's goal to empower all people to reach their full potential and
its responsibility to ensure that as many Ohioans as possible are on a pathway to financial
independence; and
WHEREAS, According to the Department of Medicaid, in addition to promoting economic
stability and financial independence, implementing Medicaid work requirements will improve health
outcomes by encouraging individuals to be engaged with their health and health care; and
WHEREAS, Adding work requirements to the Medicaid program would ensure that
Medicaid recipients continue to maintain existing employable skills or develop and improve
employable skills; now therefore be it
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the 136th General Assembly of the State of Ohio,
urge the President of the United States to support the Department of Medicaid's request to impose
work requirements for certain Medicaid recipients; and be it further
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit duly authenticated copies of this

S. C. R. No. 5 136th G.A.
