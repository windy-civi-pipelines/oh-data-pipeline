legal claim shall not disclose confidential or privileged 325

funding agreement pertaining to the action in question after 337

requesting party or insurer within thirty days after the 340
consumer enters into the agreement. 341

parties to such agreements, are presumed to be subject to 343
discovery in any civil proceeding, notwithstanding any contrary 344
provision of the agreement. 345

ascertain the status or expected value of a legal claim are not 353
subject to discovery in any civil proceeding. 354
Sec. 1357.05. A consumer litigation funding agreement 355
places a lien on the proceeds of the consumer's legal claim that 356
supersedes all subsequently perfected liens on such proceeds 357
other than liens directly related to the legal claim and 358
expressly authorized by state or federal law, such as a lien for 359
attorneys fees, a lien by the department of medicaid under 360

(C) The general assembly declares its intent in enacting 375
this section is to achieve the legitimate state interest of 376

that seek to interfere with those courts by supporting meritless 379
cases, overwhelming dockets, and profiting from litigation. 380
Sec. 1357.07. (A) No claimant, attorney or law firm 381
