To urge Congress to investigate the U.S. food supply to 1
safeguard the future of our country by ensuring that 2
all dangerous toxins and chemicals are removed from 3
our food. 4
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
OHIO:
WHEREAS, The American food industry is in crisis because 5
toxins, chemicals, and fillers are increasingly being found in 6
our food and negatively affecting our health; and 7
WHEREAS, Obesity rates in the United States have markedly 8
increased over the past several decades. According to the U.S. 9
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at least 20% 10
of adults in each U.S. state have obesity, with Ohio being one 11
of 23 states where 35% or more of adults are affected. Before 12
2013, no state had an adult obesity prevalence at or above 35%. 13
In 2023, more than 1 in 3 young adults was too heavy to serve in 14
the military; and 15
WHEREAS, Cancer rates are alarmingly high. In 2021, there 16
were 1,777,566 new cancer cases reported in the United States, 17

with 608,366 cancer-related deaths in 2022; and 18
WHEREAS, Our children's mental and physical health have 19
declined precipitously. According to CDC estimates, about 1 in 20
36 children in the U.S. has been identified with autism spectrum 21
disorder (ASD). In 2023, 40% of high school students experienced 22
persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness. In 1960, only 23
approximately 1.8% of children had a chronic physical condition. 24
By 2021, more than 40% of children and adolescents had at least 25
one chronic health condition; and 26
WHEREAS, These statistics raise significant implications 27
about the integrity of the food that Americans consume and 28
highlight the urgent need for Congressional oversight of the 29
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of 30
Agriculture, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 31
and any other federal agencies that regulate our food sources; 32
now therefore be it 33
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the House of 34
Representatives of the 136th General Assembly, urge the Congress 35
of the United States to investigate the U.S. food supply to 36
safeguard the future of our country by ensuring that all 37
dangerous toxins and chemicals are removed from our food; and be 38
it further 39
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives 40
send duly authenticated copies of this resolution to the 41
President Pro Tempore and Secretary of the United States Senate, 42
the Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of 43
Representatives, the members of the Ohio Congressional 44
delegation, and the news media of Ohio. 45
