common pleas shall not have jurisdiction, in any tort action to 18
which the amounts apply, to award punitive or exemplary damages 19
that exceed the amounts set forth, or the adjusted amounts 20

common pleas shall not have jurisdiction in any tort action to 22
which the limits apply to enter judgment on an award of 23
compensatory damages for noneconomic loss in excess of the 24
limits set forth, or the adjusted amounts of the limits 25
provided, in section 2315.18 of the Revised Code. 26
The court of common pleas may on its own motion transfer 27
for trial any action in the court to any municipal court in the 28
county having concurrent jurisdiction of the subject matter of, 29
and the parties to, the action, if the amount sought by the 30
plaintiff does not exceed one thousand dollars and if the judge 31
or presiding judge of the municipal court concurs in the 32
proposed transfer. Upon the issuance of an order of transfer, 33
the clerk of courts shall remove to the designated municipal 34
court the entire case file. Any untaxed portion of the common 35
pleas deposit for court costs shall be remitted to the municipal 36
court by the clerk of courts to be applied in accordance with 37
section 1901.26 of the Revised Code, and the costs taxed by the 38
municipal court shall be added to any costs taxed in the common 39
pleas court. 40
The court of common pleas has jurisdiction in any action 41
brought pursuant to division (I) of section 4781.40 of the 42
Revised Code if the residential premises that are the subject of 43
the action are located within the territorial jurisdiction of 44
the court. 45

Brown, Clermont, Columbiana, Gallia, Hamilton, Jefferson, 47
Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe, Scioto, and Washington counties have 48
jurisdiction beyond the north or northwest shore of the Ohio 49
river extending to the opposite shore line, between the extended 50
boundary lines of any adjacent counties or adjacent state. Each 51

H. B. No. 447 Page 3

of those courts of common pleas has concurrent jurisdiction on 52
the Ohio river with any adjacent court of common pleas that 53
borders on that river and with any court of Kentucky or of West 54
Virginia that borders on the Ohio river and that has 55
jurisdiction on the Ohio river under the law of Kentucky or the 56
law of West Virginia, whichever is applicable, or under federal 57
law. 58
Sec. 2307.80. (A) Subject to divisions (C) and (D) of this 59
section, punitive or exemplary damages shall not be awarded 60

by clear and convincing evidence, that harm for which the 63
claimant is entitled to recover compensatory damages in 64
accordance with section 2307.73 or 2307.78 of the Revised Code 65
was the result of misconduct of the manufacturer or supplier in 66
question that manifested a flagrant disregard of the safety of 67
persons who might be harmed by the product in question. The fact 68
by itself that a product is defective does not establish a 69
flagrant disregard of the safety of persons who might be harmed 70
by that product. 71
(B) Whether the trier of fact is a jury or the court, if 72
the trier of fact determines that a manufacturer or supplier in 73
question is liable for punitive or exemplary damages in 74
connection with a product liability claim, the amount of those 75
damages shall be determined by the court. In determining the 76
amount of punitive or exemplary damages, the court shall 77
consider factors including, but not limited to, the following: 78
(1) The likelihood that serious harm would arise from the 79
misconduct of the manufacturer or supplier in question; 80
(2) The degree of the awareness of the manufacturer or 81

H. B. No. 447 Page 4

supplier in question of that likelihood; 82
(3) The profitability of the misconduct to the 83
manufacturer or supplier in question; 84
(4) The duration of the misconduct and any concealment of 85
it by the manufacturer or supplier in question; 86
(5) The attitude and conduct of the manufacturer or 87
supplier in question upon the discovery of the misconduct and 88
whether the misconduct has terminated; 89
(6) The financial condition of the manufacturer or 90
supplier in question; 91
(7) The total effect of other punishment imposed or likely 92
to be imposed upon the manufacturer or supplier in question as a 93
result of the misconduct, including awards of punitive or 94
exemplary damages to persons similarly situated to the claimant 95
and the severity of criminal penalties to which the manufacturer 96
or supplier in question has been or is likely to be subjected. 97
(C)(1) Except as provided in division (C)(2) of this 98
section, if a claimant alleges in a product liability claim that 99
a drug or device caused harm to the claimant, the manufacturer 100
of the drug or device shall not be liable for punitive or 101
exemplary damages in connection with that product liability 102
claim if the drug or device that allegedly caused the harm 103
satisfies either of the following: 104

material respects in accordance with the terms of an approval or 106
license issued by the federal food and drug administration under 107

respects each of the conditions contained in the applicable 116
regulations and each of the conditions contained in an 117
applicable monograph. 118
(2) Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply if the 119
claimant establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, that 120
the manufacturer fraudulently and in violation of applicable 121
regulations of the food and drug administration withheld from 122
the food and drug administration information known to be 123
material and relevant to the harm that the claimant allegedly 124
suffered or misrepresented to the food and drug administration 125
information of that type. 126

that a product other than a drug or device caused harm to the 135

manufacturer or supplier, and the claimant's injury results from 144
an alleged defect of a product's manufacture or construction, 145
the product's design or formulation, adequate warnings or 146
instructions, and representations for which there is an 147
applicable government safety or performance standard. 148
(2) Division (D)(1) of this section does not apply if the 149
claimant establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, that 150
the manufacturer or supplier of the product other than a drug or 151
device fraudulently and in violation of applicable government 152
safety and performance standards, whether or not designated as 153
such by the government, withheld from an applicable government 154

judgment, judgment entries, or other evidence showing that 523
punitive or exemplary damages have already been awarded and have 524
been collected, in any state or federal court, against that 525
defendant based on the same act or course of conduct that is 526
alleged to have caused the injury or loss to person or property 527

course of conduct for which punitive or exemplary damages have 556

convincing evidence that the total amount of prior punitive or 558
exemplary damages awards was totally insufficient to punish that 559
defendant's behavior of a type described in division (C) of this 560

specific findings of fact in the record to support its 563
