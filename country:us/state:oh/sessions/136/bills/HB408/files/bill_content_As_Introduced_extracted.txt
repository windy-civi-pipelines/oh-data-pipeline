(a) The person against whom the defensive force is used 57
has a right to be in, or is a lawful resident of, the residence 58
or vehicle. 59
(b) The person who uses the defensive force uses it while 60
in a residence or vehicle and the person is unlawfully, and 61
without privilege to be, in that residence or vehicle. 62
(4) The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this 63

burden of proof remains proof beyond a reasonable doubt as 66
described in divisions (A) and (B)(1) of this section. 67
(C) As part of its charge to the jury in a criminal case, 68
the court shall read the definitions of "reasonable doubt" and 69
"proof beyond a reasonable doubt," contained in division (E) of 70
this section. 71
(D) As used in this section: 72
(1) An "affirmative defense" is either of the following: 73
(a) A defense expressly designated as affirmative; 74
(b) A defense involving an excuse or justification 75
peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused, on which the 76
accused can fairly be required to adduce supporting evidence. 77
H. B. No. 408 Page 4
As Introduced
(2) "Dwelling" means a building or conveyance of any kind 78
that has a roof over it and that is designed to be occupied by 79
people lodging in the building or conveyance at night, 80
regardless of whether the building or conveyance is temporary or 81
permanent or is mobile or immobile. As used in this division, a 82
building or conveyance includes, but is not limited to, an 83
attached porch, and a building or conveyance with a roof over it 84
includes, but is not limited to, a tent. 85
(3) "Residence" means a dwelling in which a person resides 86
either temporarily or permanently or is visiting as a guest. 87
(4) "Vehicle" means a conveyance of any kind, whether or 88
not motorized, that is designed to transport people or property. 89
(E) "Reasonable doubt" is present when the jurors, after 90
they have carefully considered and compared all the evidence, 91
cannot say they are firmly convinced of the truth of the charge. 92
It is a doubt based on reason and common sense. Reasonable doubt 93
is not mere possible doubt, because everything relating to human 94
affairs or depending on moral evidence is open to some possible 95
or imaginary doubt. "Proof beyond a reasonable doubt" is proof 96
of such character that an ordinary person would be willing to 97
rely and act upon it in the most important of the person's own 98
affairs. 99
Sec. 2901.09. (A) As used in this section, "residence" has 100
and "vehicle" have the same meaning meanings as in section 101

Section 6:
2901.05 of the Revised Code. 102
(B) For purposes of any section of the Revised Code that 103
sets forth a criminal offense, a person who lawfully is in that 104
person's residence has no duty to retreat before using force in 105
self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person's 106

residence if, and a person who lawfully is an occupant of that 107
person person's vehicle or who lawfully is an occupant in a 108
place in which vehicle owned by an immediate family member of 109
the person lawfully has a right no duty to beretreat before 110
using force in self-defense or defense of another. 111
(C) A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of 112
retreat as a factor in determining whether or not a person who 113
used force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of 114
that person's residence reasonably believed that the force was 115
necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or safety. 116

Section 7:
Section 2. That existing sections 2307.601, 2901.05, and 117

Section 8:
2901.09 of the Revised Code are hereby repealed. 118
