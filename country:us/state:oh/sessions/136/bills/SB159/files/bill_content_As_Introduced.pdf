application and the information or documentation required to be 164
submitted with the application. 165

the application submitted under division (B) of this section or 174
the actual eligible expenditures as finally determined under 175
division (D) of this section, whichever is least, is greater 176
than three hundred thousand dollars, the credit equals thirty 177
per cent of the least of such budgeted or actual eligible 178
expenditure amounts. 179

certificate, the amount of the credit, and any other information 194
required by the rules adopted to administer this section. 195
(3) The amount of eligible expenditures for which a tax 196
credit may be claimed is subject to inspection and examination 197
by the tax commissioner or employees of the commissioner under 198
section 5703.19 of the Revised Code and any other applicable 199
law. Once the eligible expenditures are finally determined under 200
section 5703.19 of the Revised Code and division (D) of this 201
section, the credit amount is not subject to adjustment unless 202
the director determines an error was committed in the 203
computation of the credit amount. 204
(4) No tax credit certificate may be issued before the 205
completion of the tax credit-eligible production. The amount of 206
tax credit allowed per fiscal year shall not exceed the sum of 207
(a) fifty one hundred million dollars, (b) the difference 208
between the maximum credit amount for that fiscal year under 209
section 122.852 of the Revised Code and the amount the director 210
of development elects to allow under this section pursuant to 211
division (D)(1) of section 122.852 of the Revised Code, and (c) 212
the difference between the maximum amount of credits that could 213
have been awarded in the previous fiscal year under this section 214
and the amount actually awarded. Out of that sum, five million 215
dollars shall be reserved for broadway theatrical productions, 216
and the balance may be allowed for any tax credit-eligible 217
production. For any fiscal year in which less than five million 218
dollars of tax credits are allowed for broadway theatrical 219
productions, the amount of the five million dollars not allowed 220
and added to the maximum annual amount for the following fiscal 221
year shall be reserved for broadway theatrical productions in 222
the following fiscal year. 223

in two rounds each fiscal year on a first-come, first-served, 226
basis. The first round of credits shall be awarded not later 227
than the last day of July of the fiscal year, and the second 228
round of credits shall be awarded not later than the last day of 229
the ensuing January. The amount of credits awarded in the first 230
round of applications each fiscal year shall not exceed one-half 231
of the maximum allowance for the fiscal year calculated 232
If, at any time, all complete and pending, but unapproved, 233
applications would, if all approved, result in awarded credits 234
in excess of the limit established under division (C)(4) of this 235
section, two million five hundred thousand dollars of which 236
shall be reserved for broadway theatrical productions. For each 237
round, the director shall rank the complete and pending 238
applications on the basis of the extent of positive economic 239
impact each tax credit-eligible production is likely to have in 240
this state and the effect on developing a permanent workforce in 241
motion picture or theatrical production industries in the state. 242
For the purpose of such ranking, the director shall give 243
priority to tax-credit eligible productions that are television 244
series or miniseries due to the long-term commitment typically 245
associated with such productions. The economic impact ranking 246
shall be based on the production company's total expenditures in 247
this state directly associated with the tax credit-eligible 248
production. The effect on developing a permanent workforce in 249
the motion picture or theatrical production industries shall be 250
evaluated first by the number of new jobs created and second by 251
amount of payroll added with respect to employees in this state. 252
The When ranking is required under this division, the 253
director shall approve productions in the order of their 254

S. B. No. 159 Page 10
As Introduced
ranking, from those with the greatest positive economic impact 255
and workforce development effect to those with the least 256
positive economic impact and workforce development effect. 257
(D) A production company whose motion picture or broadway 258
theatrical production has been certified as a tax credit- 259
eligible production shall engage, at the company's expense, an 260
independent certified public accountant to examine the company's 261
production, postproduction, and advertising and promotion 262
expenditures to identify the expenditures that qualify as 263
eligible expenditures. The certified public accountant shall 264
review and certify to the director all contract and expense 265
items greater than or equal to ten thousand dollars and review 266
and certify to the director not less than fifty per cent of the 267
contracts and expense items less than ten thousand dollars. The 268
certified public accountant shall then issue a report to the 269
company and to the director of development certifying the 270
company's eligible expenditures and any other information 271
required by the director. Upon receiving and examining the 272
report, the director may disallow any expenditure the director 273
determines is not an eligible expenditure. If the director 274
disallows an expenditure, the director shall issue a written 275
notice to the production company stating that the expenditure is 276
disallowed and the reason for the disallowance. Upon examination 277
of the report and disallowance of any expenditures, the director 278
shall determine finally the lesser of the total budgeted 279
eligible expenditures stated in the application submitted under 280
division (B) of this section or the actual eligible expenditures 281
for the purpose of computing the amount of the credit. 282
(E) No credit shall be allowed under section 5726.55, 283
5733.59, 5747.66, or 5751.54 of the Revised Code unless the 284
director has reviewed the report and made the determination 285

production. 290

activities that constitute the production or postproduction of a 296
