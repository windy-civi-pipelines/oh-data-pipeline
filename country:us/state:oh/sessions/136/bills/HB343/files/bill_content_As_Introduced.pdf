not abiding by the law or otherwise is not complying with the 567
conditions of the delinquent child's community control. The 568
court that places a delinquent child on community control under 569
this section shall provide the delinquent child with a written 570
notice that informs the delinquent child that authorized 571
probation officers who are engaged within the scope of their 572
supervisory duties or responsibilities may conduct those types 573
of searches during the period of community control if they have 574
reasonable grounds to believe that the delinquent child is not 575

the custody of any person, organization, or entity pursuant to 595
this section and if the delinquent act for which the child is so 596

one of the following: 599
(1) Require that the child be provided treatment as 600

in its order, until terminated or modified by the court or until 620
the child attains twenty-one years of age. 621
The department shall not release the child from a 622

judicial release of the child to court supervision under this 635
division during the first half of the prescribed minimum term 636
for which the child was committed to the department or, if the 637
child was committed to the department until the child attains 638
twenty-one years of age, during the first half of the prescribed 639
period of commitment that begins on the first day of commitment 640
and ends on the child's twenty-first birthday, provided any 641
commitment imposed under division (A), (B), (C), or (D) of 642
section 2152.17 of the Revised Code has ended. 643
(2) If the department desires to release a child during a 644
period specified in division (B)(1) of this section, it shall 645

request the court that committed the child to grant a judicial 646
release of the child to court supervision under this division. 647
During whichever of those periods is applicable, the child or 648
the parents of the child also may request that court to grant a 649
judicial release of the child to court supervision. Upon receipt 650
of a request for a judicial release to court supervision under 651
this division from the department, the child, or the child's 652
parent, or upon its own motion, the court that committed the 653
child shall do one of the following: approve the release by 654
journal entry; schedule within thirty days after the request is 655
received a time for a hearing on whether the child is to be 656
released; or reject the request by journal entry without 657
conducting a hearing. 658
If the court rejects an initial request for a release 659
under this division by the child or the child's parent, the 660
child or the child's parent may make one additional request for 661
a judicial release to court supervision within the applicable 662
period. The additional request may be made no earlier than 663
thirty days after the filing of the prior request for a judicial 664
release to court supervision. Upon the filing of a second 665
request for a judicial release to court supervision, the court 666
shall either approve or disapprove the release by journal entry 667
or schedule within thirty days after the request is received a 668
time for a hearing on whether the child is to be released. 669
(3) If a court schedules a hearing under division (B)(2) 670
of this section, it may order the department to deliver the 671
child to the court on the date set for the hearing and may order 672
the department to present to the court a report on the child's 673
progress in the institution to which the child was committed and 674
recommendations for conditions of supervision of the child by 675
the court after release. The court may conduct the hearing 676

H. B. No. 343 Page 24

without the child being present. The court shall determine at 677
the hearing whether the child should be granted a judicial 678
release to court supervision. 679
If the court approves the release under this division, it 680
shall order its staff to prepare a written treatment and 681
rehabilitation plan for the child that may include any 682
conditions of the child's release that were recommended by the 683
department and approved by the court. The committing court shall 684
send the juvenile court of the county in which the child is 685
placed a copy of the recommended plan. The court of the county 686
in which the child is placed may adopt the recommended 687
conditions set by the committing court as an order of the court 688
and may add any additional consistent conditions it considers 689
appropriate. If a child is granted a judicial release to court 690
supervision, the release discharges the child from the custody 691
of the department of youth services. 692
(C)(1) Unless the court grants judicial release under 693
division (D)(1)(b) of this section, the court that commits a 694
delinquent child to the department of youth services may grant 695
judicial release of the child to department of youth services 696
supervision under this division during the second half of the 697
prescribed minimum term for which the child was committed to the 698
department or, if the child was committed to the department 699
until the child attains twenty-one years of age, during the 700
second half of the prescribed period of commitment that begins 701
on the first day of commitment and ends on the child's twenty- 702
first birthday, provided any commitment imposed under division 703
(A), (B), (C), or (D) of section 2152.17 of the Revised Code has 704
ended. 705
(2) If the department desires to release a child during a 706

period specified in division (C)(1) of this section, it shall 707
request the court that committed the child to grant a judicial 708
release to department of youth services supervision. During 709
whichever of those periods is applicable, the child or the 710
child's parent also may request the court that committed the 711
child to grant a judicial release to department of youth 712
services supervision. Upon receipt of a request for judicial 713
release to department of youth services supervision, the child, 714
or the child's parent, or upon its own motion at any time during 715
that period, the court shall do one of the following: approve 716
the release by journal entry; schedule a time within thirty days 717
after receipt of the request for a hearing on whether the child 718
is to be released; or reject the request by journal entry 719
without conducting a hearing. 720
If the court rejects an initial request for release under 721
this division by the child or the child's parent, the child or 722
the child's parent may make one or more subsequent requests for 723
a release within the applicable period, but may make no more 724
than one request during each period of ninety days that the 725
child is in a secure department facility after the filing of a 726
prior request for early release. Upon the filing of a request 727
for release under this division subsequent to an initial 728
request, the court shall either approve or disapprove the 729
release by journal entry or schedule a time within thirty days 730
after receipt of the request for a hearing on whether the child 731
is to be released. 732
(3) If a court schedules a hearing under division (C)(2) 733
of this section, it may order the department to deliver the 734
child to the court on the date set for the hearing and shall 735
order the department to present to the court at that time a 736
treatment plan for the child's post-institutional care. The 737

H. B. No. 343 Page 26
As Introduced
court may conduct the hearing without the child being present. 738
The court shall determine at the hearing whether the child 739
should be granted a judicial release to department of youth 740
services supervision. 741
If the court approves the judicial release to department 742
of youth services supervision, the department shall prepare a 743
written treatment and rehabilitation plan for the child pursuant 744
to division (F) of this section that shall include the 745
conditions of the child's release. It shall send the committing 746
court and the juvenile court of the county in which the child is 747
placed a copy of the plan. The court of the county in which the 748
child is placed may adopt the conditions set by the department 749
as an order of the court and may add any additional consistent 750
conditions it considers appropriate, provided that the court may 751
not add any condition that decreases the level or degree of 752
supervision specified by the department in its plan, that 753
substantially increases the financial burden of supervision that 754
will be experienced by the department, or that alters the 755
placement specified by the department in its plan. If the court 756
of the county in which the child is placed adds to the 757
department's plan any additional conditions, it shall enter 758
those additional conditions in its journal and shall send to the 759
department a copy of the journal entry of the additional 760
conditions. 761
If the court approves the judicial release to department 762
of youth services supervision, the actual date on which the 763
department shall release the child is contingent upon the 764
department finding a suitable placement for the child. If the 765
child is to be returned to the child's home, the department 766
shall return the child on the date that the court schedules for 767
the child's release or shall bear the expense of any additional 768

H. B. No. 343 Page 27
As Introduced
time that the child remains in a department facility. If the 769
child is unable to return to the child's home, the department 770
shall exercise reasonable diligence in finding a suitable 771
placement for the child, and the child shall remain in a 772
department facility while the department finds the suitable 773
placement. 774
(D)(1) Subject to division (D)(3) of this section, the 775
court that commits a delinquent child to the department of youth 776
services may grant judicial release of the child under this 777
division at any time after the expiration of one of the 778
following periods of time: 779
(a) Except as otherwise provided in division (D)(1)(b) of 780
this section, if the child was committed to the department for a 781
prescribed minimum period and a maximum period not to exceed the 782
child's attainment of twenty-one years, the court may grant 783
judicial release of the child at any time after the expiration 784
of the prescribed minimum term for which the child was committed 785
to the department. 786
(b) If the child was committed to the department for both 787
one or more definite periods under division (A), (B), (C), or 788
(D) of section 2152.17 of the Revised Code and a period of the 789
type described in division (D)(1)(a) of this section, all of the 790
prescribed minimum periods of commitment imposed under division 791
(A), (B), (C), or (D) of section 2152.17 of the Revised Code and 792
the prescribed period of commitment of the type described in 793
division (D)(1)(a) of this section shall be aggregated for 794
purposes of this division, and the court may grant judicial 795
release of the child at any time after the expiration of one 796
year after the child begins serving the aggregate period of 797
commitment. 798

(2) If a court grants a judicial release of a child under 799
division (D)(1) of this section, the release shall be a judicial 800
release to department of youth services supervision, if the 801
release is granted during a period described in division (C)(1) 802
of this section, and the second and third paragraphs of division 803
(C)(3) of this section apply regarding the release. In all other 804
cases, the release shall be a judicial release to court 805
supervision, and the second paragraph of division (B)(3) of this 806
section applies regarding the release. 807
(3) A court at the time of making the disposition of a 808
child shall provide notice in the order of disposition that the 809
judge is retaining jurisdiction over the child for the purpose 810
of a possible grant of judicial release of the child under 811
division (D)(1) of this section. The failure of a court to 812
provide this notice does not affect the authority of the court 813
to grant a judicial release under that division and does not 814
constitute grounds for setting aside the child's delinquent 815
child adjudication or disposition or for granting any post- 816
adjudication relief to the child. 817
(4) The department of youth services, a child committed to 818
the department, or the parents of the child, during a period 819
specified in division (D)(1) of this section, may request the 820
court that committed the child to grant a judicial release of 821
the child under that division. Upon receipt of a request for 822
judicial release of a child under this division from the 823
department, the child, or the child's parent, or upon its own 824
motion, the court that committed the child shall do one of the 825
following: 826
(a) Approve the request by journal entry; 827
(b) Schedule within thirty days after the request is 828

released; 830
(c) Reject the request by journal entry without conducting 831
a hearing. 832
If the court rejects an initial request for a release 833
under this division by the child or the child's parent, division 834
(C)(2) of this section applies regarding the making of 835
additional requests. 836
If the court schedules a hearing under this division to 837
consider the judicial release, the first paragraph of division 838
(B)(3) of this section applies regarding the hearing. 839
(E) If a child is released under division (B), (C), or (D) 840
of this section and the court of the county in which the child 841
is placed has reason to believe that the child's deportment is 842
not in accordance with the conditions of the child's judicial 843
release, the court of the county in which the child is placed 844
shall schedule a time for a hearing to determine whether the 845
child violated any of the post-release conditions, and, if the 846
child was released under division (C) of this section or under 847
division (D) of this section under department supervision, 848
divisions (A) to (E) of section 5139.52 of the Revised Code 849
apply regarding the child. 850
If that court determines at the hearing that the child 851
violated any of the post-release conditions, the court, if it 852
determines that the violation was a serious violation, may order 853
the child to be returned to the department for 854
institutionalization, consistent with the original order of 855
commitment of the child, or in any case may make any other 856
disposition of the child authorized by law that the court 857

committed to the department of youth services, orally or in 1344
writing, asks the superintendent of the institution in which the 1345
child is located whether the child is being disciplined by the 1346
personnel of the institution, what disciplinary measure the 1347
personnel of the institution are using for the child, or why the 1348

after the day on which the request is made, shall provide the 1351
parent, guardian, or custodian with written or oral responses to 1352

department has ascertained. 1370
(2) The failure of the department of youth services to 1371
provide any notification required by or answer any requests made 1372
pursuant to division (E) of this section does not create a cause 1373
of action against the state. 1374
(F) The department of youth services, as a means of 1375
punishment while the child is in its custody, shall not prohibit 1376
a child who is committed to the department from seeing that 1377
child's parent, guardian, or custodian during standard 1378
visitation periods allowed by the department of youth services 1379
unless the superintendent of the institution in which the child 1380
is held determines that permitting that child to visit with the 1381
child's parent, guardian, or custodian would create a safety 1382
risk to that child, that child's parents, guardian, or 1383
custodian, the personnel of the institution, or other children 1384
held in that institution. 1385

the Revised Code, and the child may be released from 1451
institutionalization or institutionalization in a secure 1452

those circumstances shall not be released from 1454
institutionalization or institutionalization in a secure 1455
facility except in accordance with section 2152.22 or 5139.38 of 1456

child is placed may adopt the conditions as an order of the 1472
court and may add any additional consistent conditions it 1473
considers appropriate, provided that the court may not add any 1474
condition that decreases the level or degree of supervision 1475
specified by the department in its plan, that substantially 1476
increases the financial burden of supervision that will be 1477

experienced by the department, or that alters the placement 1478
specified by the department in its plan. Any violations of the 1479
conditions of the child's judicial release or early release 1480
shall be handled pursuant to division (E) of section 2152.22 of 1481
the Revised Code. 1482
(C) When a child has been committed to the department of 1483
youth services, the department may do any of the following: 1484
(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, 1485
Chapter 2151., or Chapter 2152. of the Revised Code that 1486
prescribe required periods of institutionalization, transfer the 1487
child to any other state institution, whenever it appears that 1488
the child by reason of mental illness or developmental 1489
disability ought to be in another state institution. Before 1490
transferring a child to any other state institution, the 1491
department shall include in the minutes a record of the order of 1492
transfer and the reason for the transfer and, at least seven 1493
days prior to the transfer, shall send a certified copy of the 1494
order to the person shown by its record to have had the care or 1495
custody of the child immediately prior to the child's 1496
commitment. Except as provided in division (C)(2) of this 1497
section, no person shall be transferred from a benevolent 1498
institution to a correctional institution or to a facility or 1499
institution operated by the department of youth services. 1500
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, 1501
Chapter 2151., or Chapter 2152. of the Revised Code that 1502
prescribe required periods of institutionalization, transfer the 1503
child under section 5120.162 of the Revised Code to a 1504
correctional medical center established by the department of 1505
rehabilitation and correction, whenever the child has an 1506
illness, physical condition, or other medical problem and it 1507

H. B. No. 343 Page 52
As Introduced
appears that the child would benefit from diagnosis or treatment 1508
at the center for that illness, condition, or problem. Before 1509
transferring a child to a center, the department of youth 1510
services shall include in the minutes a record of the order of 1511
transfer and the reason for the transfer and, except in 1512
emergency situations, at least seven days prior to the transfer, 1513
shall send a certified copy of the order to the person shown by 1514
its records to have had the care or custody of the child 1515
immediately prior to the child's commitment. If the transfer of 1516
the child occurs in an emergency situation, as soon as possible 1517
after the decision is made to make the transfer, the department 1518
of youth services shall send a certified copy of the order to 1519
the person shown by its records to have had the care or custody 1520
of the child immediately prior to the child's commitment. A 1521
transfer under this division shall be in accordance with the 1522
terms of the agreement the department of youth services enters 1523
into with the department of rehabilitation and correction under 1524
section 5120.162 of the Revised Code and shall continue only as 1525
long as the child reasonably appears to receive benefit from 1526
diagnosis or treatment at the center for an illness, physical 1527
condition, or other medical problem. 1528
(3) Revoke or modify any order of the department except an 1529
order of discharge as often as conditions indicate it to be 1530
desirable; 1531
(4) If the child was committed pursuant to division (A)(1) 1532
(b), (c), (d), or (e) or (B) of section 2152.16 of the Revised 1533
Code and has been institutionalized or institutionalized in a 1534
secure facility for the prescribed minimum periods of time under 1535
the division pursuant to which the commitment was made, assign 1536
the child to a family home, a group care facility, or other 1537
place maintained under public or private auspices, within or 1538

the costs of which may be paid by the department, provided that 1540
the department shall notify the committing court, in writing, of 1541
the place and terms of the assignment at least fifteen days 1542
prior to the scheduled date of the assignment; 1543
(5) Release the child from an institution in accordance 1544
with sections 5139.51 to 5139.54 of the Revised Code in the 1545
circumstances described in those sections. 1546
(D) The department of youth services shall notify the 1547
committing court of any order transferring the physical location 1548
of any child committed to it in accordance with section 5139.35 1549
of the Revised Code. Upon the discharge from its custody and 1550
control, the department may petition the court for an order 1551
terminating its custody and control. 1552
Sec. 5139.20. (A) Notwithstanding any other provision of 1553
the Revised Code that sets forth the minimum periods or period 1554
for which a child committed to the department of youth services 1555
is to be institutionalized or institutionalized in a secure 1556
facility or the procedures for the judicial release to court 1557
supervision or judicial release to department of youth services 1558
supervision, the department may grant emergency releases to 1559
children confined in state juvenile institutions if the 1560
governor, upon request of the director of the department 1561
authorizes the director, in writing, to issue a declaration that 1562
an emergency overcrowding condition exists in all of the 1563
institutions in which males are confined, or in all of the 1564
institutions in which females are confined, that are under the 1565
control of the department. If the governor authorizes the 1566
issuance of a declaration, the director may issue the 1567
declaration. If the director issues the declaration, the 1568

H. B. No. 343 Page 54
As Introduced
director shall file a copy of it with the secretary of state, 1569
which copy shall be a public record. Upon the filing of the 1570
copy, the department is authorized to grant emergency releases 1571
to children within its custody subject to division (B) of this 1572
section. The authority to grant the emergency releases shall 1573
continue until the expiration of thirty days from the day on 1574
which the declaration was filed. The director shall not issue a 1575
declaration that an emergency overcrowding condition exists 1576
unless the director determines that no other method of 1577
alleviating the overcrowding condition is available. 1578
(B)(1) If the department is authorized under division (A) 1579
of this section to grant emergency releases to children within 1580
its custody, the department shall determine which, if any, 1581
children to release under that authority only in accordance with 1582
this division and divisions (C), (D), and (E) of this section. 1583
The department, in determining which, if any, children to 1584
release, initially shall classify each child within its custody 1585
according to the degree of offense that the act for which the 1586
child is serving the period of institutionalization would have 1587
been if committed by an adult. The department then shall 1588
scrutinize individual children for emergency release, based upon 1589
their degree of offense, in accordance with the categories and 1590
the order of consideration set forth in division (B)(2) of this 1591
section. After scrutiny of all children within the particular 1592
category under consideration, the department shall designate 1593
individual children within that category to whom it wishes to 1594
grant an emergency release. 1595
(2) The categories of children in the custody of the 1596
department that may be considered for emergency release under 1597
this section, and the order in which the categories shall be 1598
considered, are as follows: 1599

H. B. No. 343 Page 55
As Introduced
(a) Initially, only children who are not serving a period 1600
of institutionalization for an act that would have been 1601
aggravated murder, murder, or a felony of the first, second, 1602
third, or fourth degree if committed by an adult or for an act 1603
that was committed before July 1, 1996, and that would have been 1604
an aggravated felony of the first, second, or third degree if 1605
committed by an adult may be considered. 1606
(b) When all children in the category described in 1607
division (B)(2)(a) of this section have been scrutinized and all 1608
children in that category who have been designated for emergency 1609
release under division (B)(1) of this section have been so 1610
released, then all children who are not serving a period of 1611
institutionalization for an act that would have been aggravated 1612
murder, murder, or a felony of the first or second degree if 1613
committed by an adult or for an act that was committed before 1614
July 1, 1996, and that would have been an aggravated felony of 1615
the first or second degree if committed by an adult may be 1616
considered. 1617
(c) When all children in the categories described in 1618
divisions (B)(2)(a) and (b) of this section have been 1619
scrutinized and all children in those categories who have been 1620
designated for emergency release under division (B)(1) of this 1621
section have been released, then all children who are not 1622
serving a term of institutionalization for an act that would 1623
have been aggravated murder, murder, or a felony of the first 1624
degree if committed by an adult or for an act that was committed 1625
before July 1, 1996, and that would have been an aggravated 1626
felony of the first or second degree if committed by an adult 1627
may be considered. 1628
(d) In no case shall the department consider for emergency 1629

H. B. No. 343 Page 56
As Introduced
release any child who is serving a term of institutionalization 1630
for an act that would have been aggravated murder, murder, or a 1631
felony of the first degree if committed by an adult or for an 1632
act that was committed before July 1, 1996, and that would have 1633
been an aggravated felony of the first degree if committed by an 1634
adult, and in no case shall the department grant an emergency 1635
release to any such child pursuant to this section. 1636
(C) An emergency release granted pursuant to this section 1637
shall consist of one of the following: 1638
(1) A supervised release under terms and conditions that 1639
the department believes conducive to law-abiding conduct; 1640
(2) A discharge of the child from the custody and control 1641
of the department if the department is satisfied that the 1642
discharge is consistent with the welfare of the individual and 1643
protection of the public; 1644
(3) An assignment to a family home, a group care facility, 1645
or other place maintained under public or private auspices, 1646
within or without this state, for necessary treatment or 1647
rehabilitation, the costs of which may be paid by the 1648
department. 1649
(D) If a child is granted an emergency release pursuant to 1650
this section, the child thereafter shall be considered to have 1651
been institutionalized or institutionalized in a secure facility 1652
for the prescribed minimum period of time under division (A)(1) 1653
(b), (c), (d), or (e) or (B) of section 2152.16 of the Revised 1654
Code, or all definite periods of commitment imposed under 1655
division (A), (B), (C), or (D) of section 2152.17 of the Revised 1656
Code plus the prescribed minimum period of time imposed under 1657
division (A)(1)(b), (c), (d), or (e) or (B) of section 2152.16 1658

of the Revised Code, whichever is applicable. The department 1659
shall retain legal custody of a child so released until it 1660
discharges the child or until its custody is terminated as 1661
otherwise provided by law. 1662
(E)(1) If a child is granted an emergency release so that 1663
the child is released on supervised release or assigned to a 1664
family home, group care facility, or other place for treatment 1665
or rehabilitation, the department shall prepare a written 1666
treatment and rehabilitation plan for the child in accordance 1667
with division (F) of section 2152.22 of the Revised Code, which 1668
shall include the conditions of the child's release or 1669
assignment, and shall send the committing court and the juvenile 1670
court of the county in which the child is placed a copy of the 1671
plan and the conditions that it fixed. The court of the county 1672
in which the child is placed may adopt the conditions as an 1673
order of the court and may add any additional consistent 1674
conditions it considers appropriate. If a child is released on 1675
supervised release or is assigned subject to specified 1676
conditions and the court of the county in which the child is 1677
placed has reason to believe that the child's deportment is not 1678
in accordance with any post-release conditions established by 1679
the court in its journal entry, the court of the county in which 1680
the child is placed, in its discretion, may schedule a time for 1681
a hearing on whether the child violated any of the post-release 1682
conditions. If that court conducts a hearing and determines at 1683
the hearing that the child violated any of the post-release 1684
conditions established in its journal entry, the court, if it 1685
determines that the violation of the conditions was a serious 1686
violation, may order the child to be returned to the department 1687
of youth services for institutionalization or, in any case, may 1688
make any other disposition of the child authorized by law that 1689

H. B. No. 343 Page 58

the court considers proper. If the court of the county in which 1690
the child is placed orders the child to be returned to a 1691
department of youth services institution, the child shall remain 1692
institutionalized for a minimum period of three months. 1693
(2) The department also shall file a written progress 1694
report with the committing court regarding each child granted an 1695
emergency release pursuant to this section at least once every 1696
thirty days unless specifically directed otherwise by the court. 1697
The report shall include the information required of reports 1698
described in division (G) of section 2152.22 of the Revised 1699
Code. 1700

the management and control of the department, without first 1710
obtaining the prior consent of the committing court. 1711
(B) Except as provided in division (C) of this section, 1712
the department of youth services shall notify the committing 1713

an institution with a less restrictive setting than that in 1720
which the child was originally placed, other than an institution 1721

section 2152.17 of the Revised Code to a correctional medical 1728
center established by the department of rehabilitation and 1729
correction, the department of youth services shall send the 1730
committing court a certified copy of the transfer order. 1731
Sec. 5139.51. (A) The release authority of the department 1732
of youth services shall not release a child who is in the 1733
custody of the department of youth services from institutional 1734
care or institutional care in a secure facility and shall not 1735
discharge the child or order the child's release on supervised 1736
release prior to the expiration of the prescribed minimum period 1737
of institutionalization or institutionalization in a secure 1738
facility or prior to the child's attainment of twenty-one years 1739
of age, whichever is applicable under the order of commitment, 1740
other than as is provided in section 2152.22 of the Revised 1741
Code. The release authority may conduct periodic reviews of the 1742
case of each child who is in the custody of the department and 1743
who is eligible for supervised release or discharge after 1744
completing the minimum period of time or period of time in an 1745
institution prescribed by the committing court. At least thirty 1746
days prior to conducting a periodic review of the case of a 1747
child who was committed to the department regarding the 1748
possibility of supervised release or discharge and at least 1749
thirty days prior to conducting a release review, a release 1750

hearing, or a discharge review under division (E) of this 1751
section, the release authority shall give notice of the review 1752
or hearing to the court that committed the child, to the 1753
prosecuting attorney in the case, and to the victim of the 1754
delinquent act for which the child was committed or the victim's 1755
representative. If a child is on supervised release and has had 1756
the child's parole revoked, and if, upon release, there is 1757
insufficient time to provide the notices otherwise required by 1758
this division, the release authority, at least ten days prior to 1759
the child's release, shall provide reasonable notice of the 1760
child's release to the court that committed the child, to the 1761
prosecuting attorney in the case, and to the victim of the 1762
delinquent act for which the child was committed or the victim's 1763
representative. The court or prosecuting attorney may submit to 1764
the release authority written comments regarding, or written 1765
objections to, the supervised release or discharge of that 1766
child. Additionally, if the child was committed for an act that 1767
is a category one or category two offense, the court or 1768
prosecuting attorney orally may communicate to a representative 1769
of the release authority comments regarding, or objections to, 1770
the supervised release or discharge of the child or, if a 1771
hearing is held regarding the possible release or discharge of 1772
the child, may communicate those comments at the hearing. In 1773
conducting the review of the child's case regarding the 1774
possibility of supervised release or discharge, the release 1775
authority shall consider any comments and objections so 1776
submitted or communicated by the court or prosecutor and any 1777
statements or comments submitted or communicated under section 1778
5139.56 of the Revised Code by a victim of an act for which the 1779
child was committed to the legal custody of the department or by 1780
the victim's representative of a victim of an act of that type. 1781

H. B. No. 343 Page 61
As Introduced
The release authority shall determine the date on which a 1782
child may be placed on supervised release or discharged. If the 1783
release authority believes that a child should be placed on 1784
supervised release, it shall comply with division (B) of this 1785
section. If the release authority believes that a child should 1786
be discharged, it shall comply with division (C) or (E) of this 1787
section. If the release authority denies the supervised release 1788
or discharge of a child, it shall provide the child with a 1789
written record of the reasons for the decision. 1790
(B)(1) When the release authority decides to place a child 1791
on supervised release, consistent with division (D) of this 1792
section, the department shall prepare a written supervised 1793
release plan that specifies the terms and conditions upon which 1794
the child is to be released from an institution on supervised 1795
release and, at least thirty days prior to the release of the 1796
child on the supervised release, shall send to the committing 1797
court and the juvenile court of the county in which the child 1798
will be placed a copy of the supervised release plan and the 1799
terms and conditions of release. The juvenile court of the 1800
county in which the child will be placed, within fifteen days 1801
after its receipt of the copy of the supervised release plan, 1802
may add to the supervised release plan any additional consistent 1803
terms and conditions it considers appropriate, provided that the 1804
court may not add any term or condition that decreases the level 1805
or degree of supervision specified by the release authority in 1806
the plan, that substantially increases the financial burden of 1807
supervision that will be experienced by the department of youth 1808
services, or that alters the placement specified by the plan. 1809
If, within fifteen days after its receipt of the copy of 1810
the supervised release plan, the juvenile court of the county in 1811
which the child will be placed does not add to the supervised 1812

H. B. No. 343 Page 62
As Introduced
release plan any additional terms and conditions, the court 1813
shall enter the supervised release plan in its journal within 1814
that fifteen-day period and, within that fifteen-day period, 1815
shall send to the release authority a copy of the journal entry 1816
of the supervised release plan. The journalized plan shall apply 1817
regarding the child's supervised release. 1818
If, within fifteen days after its receipt of the copy of 1819
the supervised release plan, the juvenile court of the county in 1820
which the child will be placed adds to the supervised release 1821
plan any additional terms and conditions, the court shall enter 1822
the supervised release plan and the additional terms and 1823
conditions in its journal and, within that fifteen-day period, 1824
shall send to the release authority a copy of the journal entry 1825
of the supervised release plan and additional terms and 1826
conditions. The journalized supervised release plan and 1827
additional terms and conditions added by the court that satisfy 1828
the criteria described in this division shall apply regarding 1829
the child's supervised release. 1830
If, within fifteen days after its receipt of the copy of 1831
the supervised release plan, the juvenile court of the county in 1832
which the child will be placed neither enters in its journal the 1833
supervised release plan nor enters in its journal the supervised 1834
release plan plus additional terms and conditions added by the 1835
court, the court and the department of youth services may 1836
attempt to resolve any differences regarding the plan within 1837
three days. If a resolution is not reached within that three-day 1838
period, thereafter, the supervised release plan shall be 1839
enforceable to the same extent as if the court actually had 1840
entered the supervised release plan in its journal. 1841
(2) When the release authority receives from the court a 1842

H. B. No. 343 Page 63
As Introduced
copy of the journalized supervised release plan and, if 1843
applicable, a copy of the journalized additional terms and 1844
conditions added by the court, the release authority shall keep 1845
the original copy or copies in the child's file and shall 1846
provide a copy of each document to the child, the employee of 1847
the department who is assigned to supervise and assist the child 1848
while on release, and the committing court. 1849
(C) If a child who is in the custody of the department of 1850
youth services was committed pursuant to division (A)(1)(b), 1851
(c), (d), or (e) or (B) of section 2152.16 of the Revised Code 1852
and has been institutionalized or institutionalized in a secure 1853
facility for the prescribed minimum periods of time under those 1854
divisions and if the release authority is satisfied that the 1855
discharge of the child without the child being placed on 1856
supervised release would be consistent with the welfare of the 1857
child and protection of the public, the release authority, 1858
without approval of the court that committed the child, may 1859
discharge the child from the department's custody and control 1860
without placing the child on supervised release. Additionally, 1861
the release authority may discharge a child in the department's 1862
custody without the child being placed on supervised release if 1863
the child is removed from the jurisdiction of this state by a 1864
court order of a court of this state, another state, or the 1865
United States, or by any agency of this state, another state, or 1866
the United States, if the child is convicted of or pleads guilty 1867
to any criminal offense, or as otherwise provided by law. At 1868
least fifteen days before the scheduled date of discharge of the 1869
child without the child being placed on supervised release, the 1870
department shall notify the committing court, in writing, that 1871
it is going to discharge the child and of the reason for the 1872
discharge. Upon discharge of the child without the child being 1873

H. B. No. 343 Page 64
As Introduced
placed on supervised release, the department immediately shall 1874
certify the discharge in writing and shall transmit the 1875
certificate of discharge to the committing court. 1876
(D) In addition to requirements that are reasonably 1877
related to the child's prior pattern of criminal or delinquent 1878
behavior and the prevention of further criminal or delinquent 1879
behavior, the release authority shall specify the following 1880
requirements for each child whom it releases: 1881
(1) The child shall observe the law. 1882
(2) The child shall maintain appropriate contact, as 1883
specified in the written supervised release plan for that child. 1884
(3) The child shall not change residence unless the child 1885
seeks prior approval for the change from the employee of the 1886
department assigned to supervise and assist the child, provides 1887
that employee, at the time the child seeks the prior approval 1888
for the change, with appropriate information regarding the new 1889
residence address at which the child wishes to reside, and 1890
obtains the prior approval of that employee for the change. 1891
(E) The period of a child's supervised release may extend 1892
from the date of release from an institution until the child 1893
attains twenty-one years of age. If the period of supervised 1894
release extends beyond one year after the date of release, the 1895
child may request in writing that the release authority conduct 1896
a discharge review after the expiration of the one-year period 1897
or the minimum period or period. If the child so requests, the 1898
release authority shall conduct a discharge review and give the 1899
child its decision in writing. The release authority shall not 1900
grant a discharge prior to the discharge date if it finds good 1901
cause for retaining the child in the custody of the department 1902

H. B. No. 343 Page 65
As Introduced
until the discharge date. A child may request an additional 1903
discharge review six months after the date of a previous 1904
discharge review decision, but not more than once during any 1905
six-month period after the date of a previous discharge review 1906
decision. 1907
(F) At least two weeks before the release authority places 1908
on supervised release or discharge a child who was committed to 1909
the legal custody of the department, the release authority shall 1910
provide notice of the release or discharge as follows: 1911
(1) In relation to the placement on supervised release or 1912
discharge of a child who was committed to the department for 1913
committing an act that is a category one or category two 1914
offense, the release authority shall notify, by the specified 1915
deadline, all of the following of the release or discharge: 1916
(a) The prosecuting attorney of the county in which the 1917
child was adjudicated a delinquent child and committed to the 1918
custody of the department; 1919
(b) Whichever of the following is applicable: 1920
(i) If upon the supervised release or discharge the child 1921
will reside in a municipal corporation, the chief of police or 1922
other chief law enforcement officer of that municipal 1923
corporation; 1924
(ii) If upon the supervised release or discharge the child 1925
will reside in an unincorporated area of a county, the sheriff 1926
of that county. 1927
(2) In relation to the placement on supervised release or 1928
discharge of a child who was committed to the department for 1929
committing any act, the release authority shall notify, by the 1930
specified deadline, each victim of the act for which the child 1931

H. B. No. 343 Page 66

was committed to the legal custody of the department who, 1932
pursuant to section 5139.56 of the Revised Code, has requested 1933
to be notified of the placement of the child on supervised 1934
release or the discharge of the child, provided that, if any 1935
victim has designated a person pursuant to that section to act 1936
on the victim's behalf as a victim's representative, the 1937
notification required by this division shall be provided to that 1938
victim's representative. 1939
Section 2. That existing sections 2152.16, 2152.17, 1940
