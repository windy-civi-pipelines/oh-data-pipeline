of the United States, "as amended," means the Internal Revenue 15
Code or other laws of the United States as they exist on the 16
effective date. 17
(2) This section does not apply to any reference in Title 18
LVII of the Revised Code to the Internal Revenue Code as of a 19

laws of the United States as of a date certain specifying the 21
day, month, and year. 22

otherwise apply. The filing by the taxpayer for that taxable 31
year of a report or return that incorporates the provisions of 32
the Internal Revenue Code or other laws of the United States 33

year, and that does not include any adjustments to reverse the 35

As Passed by the House

Section 5:
Section 3. This act is hereby declared to be an emergency 45
measure necessary for the immediate preservation of the public 46
peace, health, and safety. The reason for such necessity is to 47
enable taxpayers to avoid making miscellaneous adjustments on 48
their 2024 tax returns that increase costs of compliance. 49
Therefore, this act shall go into immediate effect. 50
