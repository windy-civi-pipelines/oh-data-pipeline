of the county within which the permit holder operates race 1820
meetings. Forty per cent of that portion of that total sum of 1821
such odd cents shall be used by the permit holder for increased 1822
purse money for horse races. The remaining thirty-five per cent 1823
of that portion of that total sum of odd cents shall be retained 1824
by the permit holder. 1825
(J)(1) To encourage the improvement of racing facilities 1826
for the benefit of the public, breeders, and horse owners, and 1827
to increase the revenue to the state from the increase in pari- 1828
mutuel wagering resulting from those improvements, the taxes 1829
paid by a permit holder to the state as provided for in this 1830
chapter shall be reduced by three-fourths of one per cent of the 1831
total amount wagered for those permit holders who make capital 1832
improvements to existing race tracks or construct new race 1833
tracks. The percentage of the reduction that may be taken each 1834
racing day shall equal seventy-five per cent of the taxes levied 1835
under divisions (B) and (C) of this section and section 3769.087 1836
of the Revised Code, and division (F)(2) of section 3769.26 of 1837

amount each fund should receive under divisions (B) and (C) of 1839
this section and section 3769.087 of the Revised Code, and 1840
division (F)(2) of section 3769.26 of the Revised Code and the 1841
reduction provided for in this division. If the resulting 1842
percentage is less than one, that percentage shall be multiplied 1843
by the amount of the reduction provided for in this division. 1844
Otherwise, the permit holder shall receive the full reduction 1845
provided for in this division. The amount of the allowable 1846
reduction not received shall be carried forward and applied 1847
against future tax liability. After any reductions expire, any 1848
reduction carried forward shall be treated as a reduction as 1849
provided for in this division. 1850
If more than one permit holder is authorized to conduct 1851
racing at the facility that is being built or improved, the cost 1852
of the new race track or capital improvement shall be allocated 1853
between or among all the permit holders in the ratio that the 1854
permit holders' number of racing days bears to the total number 1855
of racing days conducted at the facility. 1856
A reduction for a new race track or a capital improvement 1857
shall start from the day racing is first conducted following the 1858
date actual construction of the new race track or each capital 1859
improvement is completed and the construction cost has been 1860
approved by the racing commission, unless otherwise provided in 1861
this section. A reduction for a new race track or a capital 1862
improvement shall continue for a period of twenty-five years for 1863
new race tracks and for fifteen years for capital improvements 1864
if the construction of the capital improvement or new race track 1865
commenced prior to March 29, 1988, and for a period of ten years 1866
for new race tracks or capital improvements if the construction 1867
of the capital improvement or new race track commenced on or 1868
after March 29, 1988, but before June 6, 2001, or until the 1869

total tax reduction reaches seventy per cent of the approved 1870
cost of the new race track or capital improvement, as allocated 1871
to each permit holder, whichever occurs first. A reduction for a 1872
new race track or a capital improvement approved after June 6, 1873
2001, shall continue until the total tax reduction reaches one 1874
hundred per cent of the approved cost of the new race track or 1875
capital improvement, as allocated to each permit holder. 1876
A reduction granted for a new race track or a capital 1877
improvement, the application for which was approved by the 1878
racing commission after March 29, 1988, but before June 6, 2001, 1879
shall not commence nor shall the ten-year period begin to run 1880
until all prior tax reductions with respect to the same race 1881
track have ended. The total tax reduction because of capital 1882
improvements shall not during any one year exceed for all permit 1883
holders using any one track three-fourths of one per cent of the 1884
total amount wagered, regardless of the number of capital 1885
improvements made. Several capital improvements to a race track 1886
may be consolidated in an application if the racing commission 1887
approved the application prior to March 29, 1988. No permit 1888
holder may receive a tax reduction for a capital improvement 1889
approved by the racing commission on or after March 29, 1988, at 1890
a race track until all tax reductions have ended for all prior 1891
capital improvements approved by the racing commission under 1892
this section or section 3769.20 of the Revised Code at that race 1893
track. If there are two or more permit holders operating 1894
meetings at the same track, they may consolidate their 1895
applications. The racing commission shall notify the tax 1896
commissioner when the reduction of tax begins and when it ends. 1897
Each fiscal year the racing commission shall submit a 1898
report to the tax commissioner, the office of budget and 1899
management, and the legislative service commission. The report 1900

shall identify each capital improvement project undertaken under 1901
this division and in progress at each race track, indicate the 1902
total cost of each project, state the tax reduction that 1903
resulted from each project during the immediately preceding 1904
fiscal year, estimate the tax reduction that will result from 1905
each project during the current fiscal year, state the total tax 1906
reduction that resulted from all such projects at all race 1907
tracks during the immediately preceding fiscal year, and 1908
estimate the total tax reduction that will result from all such 1909
projects at all race tracks during the current fiscal year. 1910
(2) In order to qualify for the reduction in tax, a permit 1911
holder shall apply to the racing commission in such form as the 1912
commission may require and shall provide full details of the new 1913
race track or capital improvement, including a schedule for its 1914
construction and completion, and set forth the costs and 1915
expenses incurred in connection with it. The racing commission 1916
shall not approve an application unless the permit holder shows 1917
that a contract for the new race track or capital improvement 1918
has been let under an unrestricted competitive bidding 1919
procedure, unless the contract is exempted by the controlling 1920
board because of its unusual nature. In determining whether to 1921
approve an application, the racing commission shall consider 1922
whether the new race track or capital improvement will promote 1923
the safety, convenience, and comfort of the racing public and 1924
horse owners and generally tend towards the improvement of 1925
racing in this state. 1926
(3) If a new race track or capital improvement is approved 1927
by the racing commission and construction has started, the tax 1928
reduction may be authorized by the commission upon presentation 1929
of copies of paid bills in excess of one hundred thousand 1930
dollars or ten per cent of the approved cost, whichever is 1931

greater. After the initial authorization, the permit holder 1932
shall present copies of paid bills. If the permit holder is in 1933
substantial compliance with the schedule for construction and 1934
completion of the new race track or capital improvement, the 1935
racing commission may authorize the continuation of the tax 1936
reduction upon the presentation of the additional paid bills. 1937
The total amount of the tax reduction authorized shall not 1938
exceed the percentage of the approved cost of the new race track 1939
or capital improvement specified in division (J)(1) of this 1940

Section 167:
section. The racing commission may terminate any tax reduction 1941
immediately if a permit holder fails to complete the new race 1942
track or capital improvement, or to substantially comply with 1943
the schedule for construction and completion of the new race 1944
track or capital improvement. If a permit holder fails to 1945
complete a new race track or capital improvement, the racing 1946
commission shall order the permit holder to repay to the state 1947
the total amount of tax reduced. The normal tax paid by the 1948
permit holder shall be increased by three-fourths of one per 1949
cent of the total amount wagered until the total amount of the 1950
additional tax collected equals the total amount of tax reduced. 1951

costs that are associated with a capital improvement or new race 1975
track and that the racing commission approves for a tax 1976

for a tax reduction under this section if it has reasonable 1979
cause to believe that the actions or negligence of the permit 1980
holder substantially contributed to the damage suffered by the 1981
track due to fire or other cause. The racing commission shall 1982
obtain any data or information available from a fire marshal, 1983
law enforcement official, or insurance company concerning any 1984
fire or other damage suffered by a track, prior to approving an 1985
application for a tax reduction. 1986
(6) The approved cost to which a tax reduction applies 1987
shall be determined by generally accepted accounting principles 1988
and verified by an audit of the permit holder's records upon 1989
completion of the project by the racing commission, or by an 1990
independent certified public accountant selected by the permit 1991
holder and approved by the commission. 1992

at and during the course of an agricultural exposition or fair, 1999
and that portion of the tax that would have been paid by 2000

proximity to the fair, and the best interests of Ohio racing. On 2010
the first day of any month on which there is money in the fund, 2011
the tax commissioner shall provide for payment to the treasurer 2012
of each agricultural society the amount of the taxes collected 2013
under this section upon racing conducted at and during the 2014

permit holders, the tax commissioner shall pay into the Ohio 2017
thoroughbred race fund a sum equal to a percentage of the amount 2018
wagered upon which the tax is paid. The percentage shall be 2019
determined by the tax commissioner and shall be rounded to the 2020
nearest one-hundredth. The percentage shall be such that, when 2021
multiplied by the amount wagered upon which tax was paid by the 2022
harness track permit holders in the most recent year for which 2023

not apply to county and independent fairs and agricultural 2028

any shortage in the accounts of such funds resulting from an 2045
insufficient payment as a tax by any other permit holder. 2046
Subject to section 3769.101 of the Revised Code, the moneys 2047
received by the tax commissioner shall be deposited monthly and 2048

same calendar year when funds are available. After this 2061
application, the tax commissioner shall pay any remaining money 2062

be reduced by the percentage prescribed in that certification 4271
for taxable years beginning in the calendar year in which that 4272

at the time of payment and all items of deduction directly 4476
allocated thereto shall be allocated to this state. 4477

transfer of tangible personal property are allocable to this 4485
state if, at the time of such sale or other transfer, the 4486
property had its physical location in this state. 4487

(b) Rents and royalties derived from tangible personal 4497
property are allocable to this state to the extent that such 4498

physical location of the property everywhere during all rental 4506
or royalty periods in the taxable year. If the physical location 4507
of the property during the rental or royalty period is unknown 4508

property is utilized in the state in which the property was 4510
located at the time the rental or royalty payor obtained 4511
possession. 4512

to this state to the extent the patent or copyright was utilized 4514

A patent is utilized in a state to the extent that it is 4516
employed in production, fabrication, manufacturing, or other 4517
processing in the state, or to the extent that a patented 4518
product is produced in the state. If the basis of receipts from 4519
patent royalties does not permit allocation to states or if the 4520
accounting procedures do not reflect states of utilization, the 4521
patent is utilized in this state if the taxpayer's domicile was 4522
in this state at the time such royalties were paid or accrued. 4523

printing or other publication originates in the state. If the 4525
basis of receipts from copyright royalties does not permit 4526

each racing day by the permit holder to the tax commissioner or 1787
the tax commissioner's agent in the county seat of the county in 1788

purse money for horse races. The remaining thirty-five per cent 1823

(J)(1) To encourage the improvement of racing facilities 1826
for the benefit of the public, breeders, and horse owners, and 1827
to increase the revenue to the state from the increase in pari- 1828
mutuel wagering resulting from those improvements, the taxes 1829
paid by a permit holder to the state as provided for in this 1830
chapter shall be reduced by three-fourths of one per cent of the 1831
total amount wagered for those permit holders who make capital 1832
improvements to existing race tracks or construct new race 1833
tracks. The percentage of the reduction that may be taken each 1834
racing day shall equal seventy-five per cent of the taxes levied 1835
under divisions (B) and (C) of this section and section 3769.087 1836
of the Revised Code, and division (F)(2) of section 3769.26 of 1837
the Revised Code, as applicable, divided by the calculated 1838

amount each fund should receive under divisions (B) and (C) of 1839
this section and section 3769.087 of the Revised Code, and 1840
division (F)(2) of section 3769.26 of the Revised Code and the 1841
reduction provided for in this division. If the resulting 1842
percentage is less than one, that percentage shall be multiplied 1843
by the amount of the reduction provided for in this division. 1844
Otherwise, the permit holder shall receive the full reduction 1845
provided for in this division. The amount of the allowable 1846
reduction not received shall be carried forward and applied 1847
against future tax liability. After any reductions expire, any 1848
reduction carried forward shall be treated as a reduction as 1849
provided for in this division. 1850
If more than one permit holder is authorized to conduct 1851
racing at the facility that is being built or improved, the cost 1852
of the new race track or capital improvement shall be allocated 1853
between or among all the permit holders in the ratio that the 1854
permit holders' number of racing days bears to the total number 1855
of racing days conducted at the facility. 1856
A reduction for a new race track or a capital improvement 1857
shall start from the day racing is first conducted following the 1858
date actual construction of the new race track or each capital 1859
improvement is completed and the construction cost has been 1860
approved by the racing commission, unless otherwise provided in 1861
this section. A reduction for a new race track or a capital 1862
improvement shall continue for a period of twenty-five years for 1863
new race tracks and for fifteen years for capital improvements 1864
if the construction of the capital improvement or new race track 1865
commenced prior to March 29, 1988, and for a period of ten years 1866
for new race tracks or capital improvements if the construction 1867
of the capital improvement or new race track commenced on or 1868
after March 29, 1988, but before June 6, 2001, or until the 1869

total tax reduction reaches seventy per cent of the approved 1870
cost of the new race track or capital improvement, as allocated 1871
to each permit holder, whichever occurs first. A reduction for a 1872
new race track or a capital improvement approved after June 6, 1873
2001, shall continue until the total tax reduction reaches one 1874
hundred per cent of the approved cost of the new race track or 1875
capital improvement, as allocated to each permit holder. 1876
A reduction granted for a new race track or a capital 1877
improvement, the application for which was approved by the 1878
racing commission after March 29, 1988, but before June 6, 2001, 1879
shall not commence nor shall the ten-year period begin to run 1880
until all prior tax reductions with respect to the same race 1881
track have ended. The total tax reduction because of capital 1882
improvements shall not during any one year exceed for all permit 1883
holders using any one track three-fourths of one per cent of the 1884
total amount wagered, regardless of the number of capital 1885
improvements made. Several capital improvements to a race track 1886
may be consolidated in an application if the racing commission 1887
approved the application prior to March 29, 1988. No permit 1888
holder may receive a tax reduction for a capital improvement 1889
approved by the racing commission on or after March 29, 1988, at 1890
a race track until all tax reductions have ended for all prior 1891
capital improvements approved by the racing commission under 1892
this section or section 3769.20 of the Revised Code at that race 1893
track. If there are two or more permit holders operating 1894
meetings at the same track, they may consolidate their 1895
applications. The racing commission shall notify the tax 1896
commissioner when the reduction of tax begins and when it ends. 1897
Each fiscal year the racing commission shall submit a 1898
report to the tax commissioner, the office of budget and 1899
management, and the legislative service commission. The report 1900

H. B. No. 298 Page 66

shall identify each capital improvement project undertaken under 1901
this division and in progress at each race track, indicate the 1902
total cost of each project, state the tax reduction that 1903
resulted from each project during the immediately preceding 1904
fiscal year, estimate the tax reduction that will result from 1905
each project during the current fiscal year, state the total tax 1906
reduction that resulted from all such projects at all race 1907
tracks during the immediately preceding fiscal year, and 1908
estimate the total tax reduction that will result from all such 1909
projects at all race tracks during the current fiscal year. 1910
(2) In order to qualify for the reduction in tax, a permit 1911
holder shall apply to the racing commission in such form as the 1912
commission may require and shall provide full details of the new 1913
race track or capital improvement, including a schedule for its 1914
construction and completion, and set forth the costs and 1915
expenses incurred in connection with it. The racing commission 1916
shall not approve an application unless the permit holder shows 1917
that a contract for the new race track or capital improvement 1918
has been let under an unrestricted competitive bidding 1919
procedure, unless the contract is exempted by the controlling 1920
board because of its unusual nature. In determining whether to 1921
approve an application, the racing commission shall consider 1922
whether the new race track or capital improvement will promote 1923
the safety, convenience, and comfort of the racing public and 1924
horse owners and generally tend towards the improvement of 1925
racing in this state. 1926
(3) If a new race track or capital improvement is approved 1927
by the racing commission and construction has started, the tax 1928
reduction may be authorized by the commission upon presentation 1929
of copies of paid bills in excess of one hundred thousand 1930
dollars or ten per cent of the approved cost, whichever is 1931

H. B. No. 298 Page 67

greater. After the initial authorization, the permit holder 1932
shall present copies of paid bills. If the permit holder is in 1933
substantial compliance with the schedule for construction and 1934
completion of the new race track or capital improvement, the 1935
racing commission may authorize the continuation of the tax 1936
reduction upon the presentation of the additional paid bills. 1937
The total amount of the tax reduction authorized shall not 1938
exceed the percentage of the approved cost of the new race track 1939
or capital improvement specified in division (J)(1) of this 1940
section. The racing commission may terminate any tax reduction 1941
immediately if a permit holder fails to complete the new race 1942
track or capital improvement, or to substantially comply with 1943
the schedule for construction and completion of the new race 1944
track or capital improvement. If a permit holder fails to 1945
complete a new race track or capital improvement, the racing 1946
commission shall order the permit holder to repay to the state 1947
the total amount of tax reduced. The normal tax paid by the 1948
permit holder shall be increased by three-fourths of one per 1949
cent of the total amount wagered until the total amount of the 1950
additional tax collected equals the total amount of tax reduced. 1951

(a) "Capital improvement" means an addition, replacement, 1953
or remodeling of a structural unit of a race track facility 1954

not limited to, the construction of barns used exclusively for 1956
the race track facility, backstretch facilities for horsemen, 1957
paddock facilities, new pari-mutuel and totalizator equipment 1958
and appurtenances to that equipment purchased by the track, new 1959

roof replacement or restoration, installations of a permanent 1963
nature forming a part of the track structure, and construction 1964
of buildings that are located on a permit holder's premises. 1965
"Capital improvement" does not include the cost of replacement 1966

repairs, painting, and maintenance required to keep a race track 1968
facility in ordinary operating condition. 1969
(b) "New race track" includes the reconstruction of a race 1970
track damaged by fire or other cause that has been declared by 1971

(c) "Approved cost" includes all debt service and interest 1974
costs that are associated with a capital improvement or new race 1975
track and that the racing commission approves for a tax 1976
reduction under division (J) of this section. 1977
(5) The racing commission shall not approve an application 1978
for a tax reduction under this section if it has reasonable 1979
cause to believe that the actions or negligence of the permit 1980
holder substantially contributed to the damage suffered by the 1981
track due to fire or other cause. The racing commission shall 1982
obtain any data or information available from a fire marshal, 1983
law enforcement official, or insurance company concerning any 1984
fire or other damage suffered by a track, prior to approving an 1985
application for a tax reduction. 1986
(6) The approved cost to which a tax reduction applies 1987
shall be determined by generally accepted accounting principles 1988
and verified by an audit of the permit holder's records upon 1989
completion of the project by the racing commission, or by an 1990
independent certified public accountant selected by the permit 1991
holder and approved by the commission. 1992

(K) No other license or excise tax or fee, except as 1993
provided in sections 3769.01 to 3769.14 of the Revised Code, 1994
shall be assessed or collected from such licensee by any county, 1995
township, district, municipal corporation, or other body having 1996
power to assess or collect a tax or fee. That portion of the tax 1997
paid under this section by permit holders for racing conducted 1998
at and during the course of an agricultural exposition or fair, 1999
and that portion of the tax that would have been paid by 2000
eligible permit holders into the nursing home franchise permit 2001
fee fund as a result of racing conducted at and during the 2002
course of an agricultural exposition or fair, shall be deposited 2003
into the state treasury to the credit of the horse racing tax 2004
fund, which is hereby created for the use of the agricultural 2005
societies of the several counties in which the taxes originate. 2006
The state racing commission shall determine eligible permit 2007
holders for purposes of the preceding sentence, taking into 2008
account the breed of horse, the racing dates, the geographic 2009
proximity to the fair, and the best interests of Ohio racing. On 2010
the first day of any month on which there is money in the fund, 2011
the tax commissioner shall provide for payment to the treasurer 2012
of each agricultural society the amount of the taxes collected 2013
under this section upon racing conducted at and during the 2014
course of any exposition or fair conducted by the society. 2015
(L) From the tax paid under this section by harness track 2016
permit holders, the tax commissioner shall pay into the Ohio 2017
thoroughbred race fund a sum equal to a percentage of the amount 2018
wagered upon which the tax is paid. The percentage shall be 2019
determined by the tax commissioner and shall be rounded to the 2020
nearest one-hundredth. The percentage shall be such that, when 2021
multiplied by the amount wagered upon which tax was paid by the 2022
harness track permit holders in the most recent year for which 2023

H. B. No. 298 Page 70

final figures are available, it results in a sum that 2024
substantially equals the same amount of tax paid by the tax 2025
commissioner during that year into the Ohio fairs fund from 2026
taxes paid by thoroughbred permit holders. This division does 2027
not apply to county and independent fairs and agricultural 2028
societies. 2029
(M) Twenty-five per cent of the taxes levied on 2030
thoroughbred racing permit holders, harness racing permit 2031

commissioner shall pay any money remaining, after the payment 2036

reductions provided for in division (J) of this section and in 2038
section 3769.20 of the Revised Code, into the Ohio fairs fund, 2039
Ohio thoroughbred race fund, Ohio standardbred development fund, 2040
and state racing commission operating fund as prescribed in this 2041
section and division (A) of section 3769.087 of the Revised 2042
Code. The tax commissioner shall thereafter use and apply the 2043
balance of the money paid as a tax by any permit holder to cover 2044
any shortage in the accounts of such funds resulting from an 2045
insufficient payment as a tax by any other permit holder. 2046
Subject to section 3769.101 of the Revised Code, the moneys 2047
received by the tax commissioner shall be deposited monthly and 2048
paid by the tax commissioner into the funds to cover the total 2049
aggregate amount due from all permit holders to the funds, as 2050
calculated under this section and division (A) of section 2051
3769.087 of the Revised Code, as applicable. If, after the 2052

fund, Ohio standardbred development fund, Ohio thoroughbred race 2056

paid to each of the funds. Any shortage to the funds as a result 2059
of a proration shall be applied against future deposits for the 2060
same calendar year when funds are available. After this 2061
application, the tax commissioner shall pay any remaining money 2062
paid as a tax by all permit holders into the nursing home 2063
franchise permit fee fund. This division does not apply to 2064

undeliverable, address or addressee unknown, or forwarding 4149
address unknown or expired. 4150
(ii) When service is completed by publication, a proof of 4151

be deemed received as of the date of the last publication. 4155

individual, trust, and estate otherwise having nexus with or in 4201
this state under the Constitution of the United States, an 4202
annual tax measured as prescribed in divisions (A)(1) to (4) of 4203
this section. 4204
(1) In the case of trusts, the tax imposed by this section 4205
shall be measured by modified Ohio taxable income under division 4206
(D) of this section and levied in the same amount as the tax is 4207
imposed on estates as prescribed in division (A)(2) of this 4208
section. 4209
(2) In the case of estates, the tax imposed by this 4210
section shall be measured by Ohio taxable income. The tax shall 4211
be levied at the rate of 1.38462% for the first twenty-six 4212
thousand fifty dollars of such income and, for income in excess 4213

section on taxable business income shall equal three per cent of 4231
the result obtained by subtracting any amount allowed under 4232
division (A)(4)(b) of this section from the individual's taxable 4233
business income. 4234

adjusted gross income less taxable business income, the excess 4237
shall be deducted from taxable business income before computing 4238
the tax under division (A)(4)(a) of this section. 4239
(5) Except as otherwise provided in this division, in 4240
August of each year, the tax commissioner shall make a new 4241
adjustment to the income amounts prescribed in divisions (A)(2) 4242
and (3) of this section by multiplying the percentage increase 4243
in the gross domestic product deflator computed that year under 4244
section 5747.025 of the Revised Code by each of the income 4245
amounts resulting from the adjustment under this division in the 4246
preceding year, adding the resulting product to the 4247
corresponding income amount resulting from the adjustment in the 4248
preceding year, and rounding the resulting sum to the nearest 4249
multiple of fifty dollars. The tax commissioner also shall 4250
recompute each of the tax dollar amounts to the extent necessary 4251
to reflect the new adjustment of the income amounts. To 4252
recompute the tax dollar amount corresponding to the lowest tax 4253
rate in division (A)(3) of this section, the commissioner shall 4254
multiply the tax rate prescribed in division (A)(2) of this 4255
section by the income amount specified in that division and as 4256
adjusted according to this paragraph. The rates of taxation 4257
shall not be adjusted. 4258

the calendar year in which the adjustments are made and to 4260
taxable years beginning in each ensuing calendar year until a 4261
calendar year in which a new adjustment is made pursuant to this 4262
division. The tax commissioner shall not make a new adjustment 4263
in any year in which the amount resulting from the adjustment 4264
would be less than the amount resulting from the adjustment in 4265
the preceding year. 4266
(B) If the director of budget and management makes a 4267
certification to the tax commissioner under division (B) of 4268
section 131.44 of the Revised Code, the amount of tax as 4269
determined under divisions (A)(1) to (3) of this section shall 4270
be reduced by the percentage prescribed in that certification 4271
for taxable years beginning in the calendar year in which that 4272
certification is made. 4273
(C)(1) The tax imposed by this section on a trust shall be 4274
computed by multiplying the Ohio modified taxable income of the 4275
trust by the rates prescribed by division (A) of this section. 4276
(2) A resident trust may claim a credit against the tax 4277
computed under division (C) of this section equal to the lesser 4278
of (a) the tax paid to another state or the District of Columbia 4279
on the resident trust's modified nonbusiness income, other than 4280
the portion of the resident trust's nonbusiness income that is 4281
qualifying investment income as defined in section 5747.012 of 4282
the Revised Code, or (b) the effective tax rate, based on 4283
modified Ohio taxable income, multiplied by the resident trust's 4284
modified nonbusiness income other than the portion of the 4285
resident trust's nonbusiness income that is qualifying 4286
investment income. The credit applies before any other 4287
applicable credits. 4288

(3) Any credit authorized against the tax imposed by this 4289
section applies to a trust subject to division (C) of this 4290
section only if the trust otherwise qualifies for the credit. To 4291
the extent that the trust distributes income for the taxable 4292
year for which a credit is available to the trust, the credit 4293
shall be shared by the trust and its beneficiaries. The tax 4294
commissioner and the trust shall be guided by applicable 4295
regulations of the United States treasury regarding the sharing 4296
of credits. 4297
(D) For the purposes of this section, "trust" means any 4298
trust described in Subchapter J of Chapter 1 of the Internal 4299
Revenue Code, excluding trusts that are not irrevocable as 4300
defined in division (I)(3)(b) of section 5747.01 of the Revised 4301

from a person's winnings does not relieve the person from 4448
liability for the tax imposed by section 5747.02 of the Revised 4449

relevant provisions of federal tax laws. 4454

personal services performed in this state who was a nonresident 4475
at the time of payment and all items of deduction directly 4476
allocated thereto shall be allocated to this state. 4477

tangible personal property, or intangible property shall be 4479
allocated as follows: 4480

property is located physically in this state. 4483
(b) Capital gains or losses from the sale or other 4484
transfer of tangible personal property are allocable to this 4485
state if, at the time of such sale or other transfer, the 4486
property had its physical location in this state. 4487
(c) Capital gains or losses from the sale or other 4488

As Introduced
(b) Rents and royalties derived from tangible personal 4497
property are allocable to this state to the extent that such 4498
property is utilized in this state. 4499
The extent of utilization of tangible personal property in 4500
a state is determined by multiplying the rents or royalties 4501
derived from such property by a fraction, the numerator of which 4502

physical location of the property everywhere during all rental 4506
or royalty periods in the taxable year. If the physical location 4507
of the property during the rental or royalty period is unknown 4508

property is utilized in the state in which the property was 4510
located at the time the rental or royalty payor obtained 4511
possession. 4512
(4) All patent and copyright royalties shall be allocated 4513
to this state to the extent the patent or copyright was utilized 4514

A patent is utilized in a state to the extent that it is 4516
employed in production, fabrication, manufacturing, or other 4517
processing in the state, or to the extent that a patented 4518
product is produced in the state. If the basis of receipts from 4519
patent royalties does not permit allocation to states or if the 4520
accounting procedures do not reflect states of utilization, the 4521
patent is utilized in this state if the taxpayer's domicile was 4522
in this state at the time such royalties were paid or accrued. 4523
A copyright is utilized in a state to the extent that 4524
printing or other publication originates in the state. If the 4525
basis of receipts from copyright royalties does not permit 4526

H. B. No. 298 Page 157

allocation to states or if the accounting procedures do not 4527
reflect states of utilization, the copyright is utilized in this 4528
state if the taxpayer's domicile was in this state at the time 4529

into account in the computation of adjusted gross income for the 4550
taxable year by a nonresident and which is not otherwise 4551
specifically allocated or apportioned pursuant to sections 4552
5747.20 to 5747.23 of the Revised Code, including, without 4553
