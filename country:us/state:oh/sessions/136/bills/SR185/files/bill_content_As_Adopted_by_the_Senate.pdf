Honoring the Barnesville State Theater on its
Centennial.
WHEREAS, The members of the Senate of the 136th General Assembly 1
of Ohio are pleased to congratulate the Barnesville State Theater on 2
the auspicious occasion of its One Hundredth Anniversary; and 3
WHEREAS, Recognition of this prestigious milestone is a fitting 4
tribute to the Barnesville State Theater, for it has become a beloved 5
local landmark and an outstanding symbol of community pride. 6
Established in 1925, the theater gained the appreciation of countless 7
audiences before falling into disuse, and in 2022, a campaign was 8
launched by local residents and volunteers to revive the structure and 9
restore it as a multi-use venue for music, performances, and the 10
advancement of the arts; and 11
WHEREAS, The spirit of our nation is founded upon, and reflected 12
in, its exciting and colorful past, and the memorializing of 13
significant buildings, such as the Barnesville State Theater, is vital 14
to the preservation of Americaâ€™s unique heritage. Indeed, the One 15
Hundredth Anniversary of this remarkable edifice is an outstanding 16
reflection not only on the structure itself but also on the numerous 17
community members and stakeholders who have contributed to its 18
preservation; and 19
WHEREAS, All those associated with the Barnesville State Theater 20
have distinguished themselves as concerned and responsible citizens. 21
With admirable dedication, they have helped to ensure that the 22
important details of our past are transmitted to future generations 23
for their appreciation, and we salute them for their work to sustain 24
the history of the area; therefore be it 25
