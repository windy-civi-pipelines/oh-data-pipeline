(B)(1) Upon request by any person and subject to division 561
(B)(8) of this section, all public records responsive to the 562
request shall be promptly prepared and made available for 563
inspection to the requester at all reasonable times during 564
S. B. No. 236 Page 21
As Introduced
regular business hours. Subject to division (B)(8) of this 565

Section 35:
section, upon request by any person, a public office or person 566
responsible for public records shall make copies of the 567
requested public record available to the requester at cost and 568
within a reasonable period of time. 569
When considering whether a state or local law enforcement 570
agency promptly prepared a video record for inspection or 571
provided a video record for production within a reasonable 572
period of time, in addition to any other factors, a court shall 573
consider the time required for a state or local law enforcement 574
agency to retrieve, download, review, redact, seek legal advice 575
regarding, and produce the video record. Notwithstanding any 576
other requirement set forth in Chapter 149. of the Revised Code, 577
a state or local law enforcement agency may charge a requester 578
the actual cost associated with preparing a video record for 579
inspection or production, not to exceed seventy-five dollars per 580
hour of video produced, nor seven hundred fifty dollars total. 581
As used in this division, "actual cost," with respect to video 582
records only, means all costs incurred by the state or local law 583
enforcement agency in reviewing, blurring or otherwise 584
obscuring, redacting, uploading, or producing the video records, 585
including but not limited to the storage medium on which the 586
record is produced, staff time, and any other relevant overhead 587
necessary to comply with the request. A state or local law 588
enforcement agency may include in its public records policy the 589
requirement that a requester pay the estimated actual cost 590
before beginning the process of preparing a video record for 591
inspection or production. Where a state or local law enforcement 592
agency imposes such a requirement, its obligation to produce a 593
video or make it available for inspection begins once the 594
estimated actual cost is paid in full by the requester. A state 595
S. B. No. 236 Page 22
As Introduced
or local law enforcement agency shall provide the requester with 596
the estimated actual cost within five business days of receipt 597
of the public records request. If the actual cost exceeds the 598
estimated actual cost, a state or local law enforcement agency 599
may charge a requester for the difference upon fulfilling a 600
request for video records if the requester is notified in 601
advance that the actual cost may be up to twenty per cent higher 602
than the estimated actual cost. A state or local law enforcement 603
agency shall not charge a requester a difference that exceeds 604
twenty per cent of the estimated actual cost. 605
If a public record contains information that is exempt 606
from the duty to permit public inspection or to copy the public 607
record, the public office or the person responsible for the 608
public record shall make available all of the information within 609
the public record that is not exempt. When making that public 610
record available for public inspection or copying that public 611
record, the public office or the person responsible for the 612
public record shall notify the requester of any redaction or 613
make the redaction plainly visible. A redaction shall be deemed 614
a denial of a request to inspect or copy the redacted 615
information, except if federal or state law authorizes or 616
requires a public office to make the redaction. When the auditor 617
of state receives a request to inspect or to make a copy of a 618
record that was provided to the auditor of state for purposes of 619
an audit, but the original public office has asserted to the 620
auditor of state that the record is not a public record, the 621
auditor of state may handle the requests by directing the 622
requestor to the original public office that provided the record 623
to the auditor of state. 624
(2) To facilitate broader access to public records, a 625
public office or the person responsible for public records shall 626
S. B. No. 236 Page 23
As Introduced
organize and maintain public records in a manner that they can 627
be made available for inspection or copying in accordance with 628
division (B) of this section. A public office also shall have 629
available a copy of its current records retention schedule at a 630
location readily available to the public. If a requester makes 631
an ambiguous or overly broad request or has difficulty in making 632
a request for copies or inspection of public records under this 633

Section 36:
section such that the public office or the person responsible 634
for the requested public record cannot reasonably identify what 635
public records are being requested, the public office or the 636
person responsible for the requested public record may deny the 637
request but shall provide the requester with an opportunity to 638
revise the request by informing the requester of the manner in 639
which records are maintained by the public office and accessed 640
in the ordinary course of the public office's or person's 641
duties. 642
(3) If a request is ultimately denied, in part or in 643
whole, the public office or the person responsible for the 644
requested public record shall provide the requester with an 645
explanation, including legal authority, setting forth why the 646
request was denied. If the initial request was provided in 647
writing, the explanation also shall be provided to the requester 648
in writing. The explanation shall not preclude the public office 649
or the person responsible for the requested public record from 650
relying upon additional reasons or legal authority in defending 651
an action commenced under division (C) of this section. 652
(4) Unless specifically required or authorized by state or 653
federal law or in accordance with division (B) of this section, 654
no public office or person responsible for public records may 655
limit or condition the availability of public records by 656
requiring disclosure of the requester's identity or the intended 657
S. B. No. 236 Page 24
As Introduced
use of the requested public record. Any requirement that the 658
requester disclose the requester's identity or the intended use 659
of the requested public record constitutes a denial of the 660
request. 661
(5) A public office or person responsible for public 662
records may ask a requester to make the request in writing, may 663
ask for the requester's identity, and may inquire about the 664
intended use of the information requested, but may do so only 665
after disclosing to the requester that a written request is not 666
mandatory, that the requester may decline to reveal the 667
requester's identity or the intended use, and when a written 668
request or disclosure of the identity or intended use would 669
benefit the requester by enhancing the ability of the public 670
office or person responsible for public records to identify, 671
locate, or deliver the public records sought by the requester. 672
(6) If any person requests a copy of a public record in 673
accordance with division (B) of this section, the public office 674
or person responsible for the public record may require the 675
requester to pay in advance the cost involved in providing the 676
copy of the public record in accordance with the choice made by 677
the requester under this division. The public office or the 678
person responsible for the public record shall permit the 679
requester to choose to have the public record duplicated upon 680
paper, upon the same medium upon which the public office or 681
person responsible for the public record keeps it, or upon any 682
other medium upon which the public office or person responsible 683
for the public record determines that it reasonably can be 684
duplicated as an integral part of the normal operations of the 685
public office or person responsible for the public record. When 686
the requester makes a choice under this division, the public 687
office or person responsible for the public record shall provide 688
S. B. No. 236 Page 25
As Introduced
a copy of it in accordance with the choice made by the 689
requester. Nothing in this section requires a public office or 690
person responsible for the public record to allow the requester 691
of a copy of the public record to make the copies of the public 692
record. 693
(7)(a) Upon a request made in accordance with division (B) 694
of this section and subject to division (B)(6) of this section, 695
a public office or person responsible for public records shall 696
transmit a copy of a public record to any person by United 697
States mail or by any other means of delivery or transmission 698
within a reasonable period of time after receiving the request 699
for the copy. The public office or person responsible for the 700
public record may require the person making the request to pay 701
in advance the cost of postage if the copy is transmitted by 702
United States mail or the cost of delivery if the copy is 703
transmitted other than by United States mail, and to pay in 704
advance the costs incurred for other supplies used in the 705
mailing, delivery, or transmission. 706
(b) Any public office may adopt a policy and procedures 707
that it will follow in transmitting, within a reasonable period 708
of time after receiving a request, copies of public records by 709
United States mail or by any other means of delivery or 710
transmission pursuant to division (B)(7) of this section. A 711
public office that adopts a policy and procedures under division 712
(B)(7) of this section shall comply with them in performing its 713
duties under that division. 714
(c) In any policy and procedures adopted under division 715
(B)(7) of this section: 716
(i) A public office may limit the number of records 717
requested by a person that the office will physically deliver by 718
S. B. No. 236 Page 26
As Introduced
United States mail or by another delivery service to ten per 719
month, unless the person certifies to the office in writing that 720
the person does not intend to use or forward the requested 721
records, or the information contained in them, for commercial 722
purposes; 723
(ii) A public office that chooses to provide some or all 724
of its public records on a web site that is fully accessible to 725
and searchable by members of the public at all times, other than 726
during acts of God outside the public office's control or 727
maintenance, and that charges no fee to search, access, 728
download, or otherwise receive records provided on the web site, 729
may limit to ten per month the number of records requested by a 730
person that the office will deliver in a digital format, unless 731
the requested records are not provided on the web site and 732
unless the person certifies to the office in writing that the 733
person does not intend to use or forward the requested records, 734
or the information contained in them, for commercial purposes. 735
(iii) For purposes of division (B)(7) of this section, 736
"commercial" shall be narrowly construed and does not include 737
reporting or gathering news, reporting or gathering information 738
to assist citizen oversight or understanding of the operation or 739
activities of government, or nonprofit educational research. 740
(8) A public office or person responsible for public 741
records is not required to permit a person who is incarcerated 742
pursuant to a criminal conviction or a juvenile adjudication to 743
inspect or to obtain a copy of any public record concerning a 744
criminal investigation or prosecution or concerning what would 745
be a criminal investigation or prosecution if the subject of the 746
investigation or prosecution were an adult, unless the request 747
to inspect or to obtain a copy of the record is for the purpose 748

record under this section and the judge who imposed the sentence 750
or made the adjudication with respect to the person, or the 751
judge's successor in office, finds that the information sought 752
in the public record is necessary to support what appears to be 753
a justiciable claim of the person. As used in this division, 754
"public record concerning a criminal investigation or 755
prosecution or concerning what would be a criminal investigation 756
or prosecution if the subject of the investigation were an 757
adult" includes, but is not limited to, personnel files and 758
payroll and attendance records of designated public service 759
workers. 760
(9)(a) Upon written request made and signed by a 761
journalist, a public office, or person responsible for public 762
records, having custody of the records of the agency employing a 763
specified designated public service worker shall disclose to the 764
journalist the address of the actual personal residence of the 765
designated public service worker and, if the designated public 766
service worker's spouse, former spouse, or child is employed by 767
a public office, the name and address of the employer of the 768
designated public service worker's spouse, former spouse, or 769
child, and any past, current, and future work schedules of the 770
designated public service worker. The request shall include the 771
journalist's name and title and the name and address of the 772
journalist's employer and shall state that disclosure of the 773
information sought would be in the public interest. 774

the first time after the relator commenced the mandamus action, 931
but before the court issued any order concluding whether or not 932

responsible for the requested public records did not constitute 954
a failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with 955
division (B) of this section; 956

resolve the dispute that was subject to the mandamus action 979
filed under division (C)(1) of this section. 980
(6) If the court does not issue a writ of mandamus under 981
division (C) of this section and the court determines at that 982
time that the bringing of the mandamus action was frivolous 983
conduct as defined in division (A) of section 2323.51 of the 984
Revised Code, the court may award to the public office all court 985

(B)(1) Upon request by any person and subject to division 561

request shall be promptly prepared and made available for 563
inspection to the requester at all reasonable times during 564

S. B. No. 236 Page 21
As Introduced
regular business hours. Subject to division (B)(8) of this 565
section, upon request by any person, a public office or person 566
responsible for public records shall make copies of the 567
requested public record available to the requester at cost and 568
within a reasonable period of time. 569
When considering whether a state or local law enforcement 570
agency promptly prepared a video record for inspection or 571
provided a video record for production within a reasonable 572
period of time, in addition to any other factors, a court shall 573
consider the time required for a state or local law enforcement 574
agency to retrieve, download, review, redact, seek legal advice 575
regarding, and produce the video record. Notwithstanding any 576
other requirement set forth in Chapter 149. of the Revised Code, 577
a state or local law enforcement agency may charge a requester 578
the actual cost associated with preparing a video record for 579
inspection or production, not to exceed seventy-five dollars per 580
hour of video produced, nor seven hundred fifty dollars total. 581
As used in this division, "actual cost," with respect to video 582
records only, means all costs incurred by the state or local law 583
enforcement agency in reviewing, blurring or otherwise 584
obscuring, redacting, uploading, or producing the video records, 585
including but not limited to the storage medium on which the 586
record is produced, staff time, and any other relevant overhead 587
necessary to comply with the request. A state or local law 588
enforcement agency may include in its public records policy the 589
requirement that a requester pay the estimated actual cost 590
before beginning the process of preparing a video record for 591
inspection or production. Where a state or local law enforcement 592
agency imposes such a requirement, its obligation to produce a 593
video or make it available for inspection begins once the 594
estimated actual cost is paid in full by the requester. A state 595

S. B. No. 236 Page 22
As Introduced
or local law enforcement agency shall provide the requester with 596
the estimated actual cost within five business days of receipt 597
of the public records request. If the actual cost exceeds the 598
estimated actual cost, a state or local law enforcement agency 599
may charge a requester for the difference upon fulfilling a 600
request for video records if the requester is notified in 601
advance that the actual cost may be up to twenty per cent higher 602
than the estimated actual cost. A state or local law enforcement 603
agency shall not charge a requester a difference that exceeds 604
twenty per cent of the estimated actual cost. 605
If a public record contains information that is exempt 606
from the duty to permit public inspection or to copy the public 607
record, the public office or the person responsible for the 608
public record shall make available all of the information within 609
the public record that is not exempt. When making that public 610
record available for public inspection or copying that public 611
record, the public office or the person responsible for the 612
public record shall notify the requester of any redaction or 613
make the redaction plainly visible. A redaction shall be deemed 614
a denial of a request to inspect or copy the redacted 615
information, except if federal or state law authorizes or 616
requires a public office to make the redaction. When the auditor 617
of state receives a request to inspect or to make a copy of a 618
record that was provided to the auditor of state for purposes of 619
an audit, but the original public office has asserted to the 620
auditor of state that the record is not a public record, the 621
auditor of state may handle the requests by directing the 622
requestor to the original public office that provided the record 623
to the auditor of state. 624
(2) To facilitate broader access to public records, a 625
public office or the person responsible for public records shall 626

S. B. No. 236 Page 23
As Introduced
organize and maintain public records in a manner that they can 627
be made available for inspection or copying in accordance with 628
division (B) of this section. A public office also shall have 629
available a copy of its current records retention schedule at a 630
location readily available to the public. If a requester makes 631
an ambiguous or overly broad request or has difficulty in making 632
a request for copies or inspection of public records under this 633
section such that the public office or the person responsible 634
for the requested public record cannot reasonably identify what 635
public records are being requested, the public office or the 636
person responsible for the requested public record may deny the 637
request but shall provide the requester with an opportunity to 638
revise the request by informing the requester of the manner in 639
which records are maintained by the public office and accessed 640
in the ordinary course of the public office's or person's 641
duties. 642
(3) If a request is ultimately denied, in part or in 643
whole, the public office or the person responsible for the 644
requested public record shall provide the requester with an 645
explanation, including legal authority, setting forth why the 646
request was denied. If the initial request was provided in 647
writing, the explanation also shall be provided to the requester 648
in writing. The explanation shall not preclude the public office 649
or the person responsible for the requested public record from 650
relying upon additional reasons or legal authority in defending 651
an action commenced under division (C) of this section. 652
(4) Unless specifically required or authorized by state or 653
federal law or in accordance with division (B) of this section, 654
no public office or person responsible for public records may 655
limit or condition the availability of public records by 656
requiring disclosure of the requester's identity or the intended 657

S. B. No. 236 Page 24
As Introduced
use of the requested public record. Any requirement that the 658
requester disclose the requester's identity or the intended use 659
of the requested public record constitutes a denial of the 660
request. 661
(5) A public office or person responsible for public 662
records may ask a requester to make the request in writing, may 663
ask for the requester's identity, and may inquire about the 664
intended use of the information requested, but may do so only 665
after disclosing to the requester that a written request is not 666
mandatory, that the requester may decline to reveal the 667
requester's identity or the intended use, and when a written 668
request or disclosure of the identity or intended use would 669
benefit the requester by enhancing the ability of the public 670
office or person responsible for public records to identify, 671
locate, or deliver the public records sought by the requester. 672
(6) If any person requests a copy of a public record in 673
accordance with division (B) of this section, the public office 674
or person responsible for the public record may require the 675
requester to pay in advance the cost involved in providing the 676
copy of the public record in accordance with the choice made by 677
the requester under this division. The public office or the 678
person responsible for the public record shall permit the 679
requester to choose to have the public record duplicated upon 680
paper, upon the same medium upon which the public office or 681
person responsible for the public record keeps it, or upon any 682
other medium upon which the public office or person responsible 683
for the public record determines that it reasonably can be 684
duplicated as an integral part of the normal operations of the 685
public office or person responsible for the public record. When 686
the requester makes a choice under this division, the public 687
office or person responsible for the public record shall provide 688

S. B. No. 236 Page 25
As Introduced
a copy of it in accordance with the choice made by the 689
requester. Nothing in this section requires a public office or 690
person responsible for the public record to allow the requester 691
of a copy of the public record to make the copies of the public 692
record. 693
(7)(a) Upon a request made in accordance with division (B) 694
of this section and subject to division (B)(6) of this section, 695
a public office or person responsible for public records shall 696
transmit a copy of a public record to any person by United 697
States mail or by any other means of delivery or transmission 698
within a reasonable period of time after receiving the request 699
for the copy. The public office or person responsible for the 700
public record may require the person making the request to pay 701
in advance the cost of postage if the copy is transmitted by 702
United States mail or the cost of delivery if the copy is 703
transmitted other than by United States mail, and to pay in 704
advance the costs incurred for other supplies used in the 705
mailing, delivery, or transmission. 706
(b) Any public office may adopt a policy and procedures 707
that it will follow in transmitting, within a reasonable period 708
of time after receiving a request, copies of public records by 709
United States mail or by any other means of delivery or 710
transmission pursuant to division (B)(7) of this section. A 711
public office that adopts a policy and procedures under division 712
(B)(7) of this section shall comply with them in performing its 713
duties under that division. 714
(c) In any policy and procedures adopted under division 715
(B)(7) of this section: 716
(i) A public office may limit the number of records 717
requested by a person that the office will physically deliver by 718

S. B. No. 236 Page 26
As Introduced
United States mail or by another delivery service to ten per 719

receive copies of any public record in a manner that fairly 856
describes the public record or class of public records to the 857
public office or person responsible for the requested public 858
records, except as otherwise provided in this section, the 859
requester shall be entitled to recover the amount of statutory 860
damages set forth in this division if a court determines that 861
the public office or the person responsible for public records 862
failed to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 863
(B) of this section. Statutory damages are not available 864
pursuant to this section to a person committed to the custody of 865

(B) of this section, beginning with the day on which the 874
requester files a mandamus action to recover statutory damages, 875
up to a maximum of one thousand dollars. The award of statutory 876
damages shall not be construed as a penalty, but as compensation 877
for injury arising from lost use of the requested information. 878
The existence of this injury shall be conclusively presumed. The 879
award of statutory damages shall be in addition to all other 880
remedies authorized by this section. 881
The court may reduce an award of statutory damages or not 882
award statutory damages if the court determines both of the 883
following: 884
(a) That, based on the ordinary application of statutory 885
law and case law as it existed at the time of the conduct or 886
threatened conduct of the public office or person responsible 887
for the requested public records that allegedly constitutes a 888
failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 889
(B) of this section and that was the basis of the mandamus 890
action, a well-informed public office or person responsible for 891
the requested public records reasonably would believe that the 892
conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or person 893
responsible for the requested public records did not constitute 894
a failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with 895
division (B) of this section; 896
(b) That a well-informed public office or person 897
responsible for the requested public records reasonably would 898
believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of the public 899

S. B. No. 236 Page 32
As Introduced
office or person responsible for the requested public records 900
would serve the public policy that underlies the authority that 901
is asserted as permitting that conduct or threatened conduct. 902
(4) In a mandamus action filed under division (C)(1) of 903
this section, the following apply: 904
(a)(i) If the court orders the public office or the person 905
responsible for the public record to comply with division (B) of 906
this section, the court shall determine and award to the relator 907
all court costs, which shall be construed as remedial and not 908
punitive. 909
(ii) If the court makes a determination described in 910
division (C)(4)(b)(iii) of this section, the court shall 911
determine and award to the relator all court costs, which shall 912
be construed as remedial and not punitive. 913
(b) If the court renders a judgment that orders the public 914
office or the person responsible for the public record to comply 915
with division (B) of this section or if the court determines any 916
of the following, the court may award reasonable attorney's fees 917
to the relator, subject to division (C)(5) of this section: 918
(i) The public office or the person responsible for the 919
public records failed to respond affirmatively or negatively to 920
the public records request in accordance with the time allowed 921
under division (B) of this section. 922
(ii) The public office or the person responsible for the 923
public records promised to permit the relator to inspect or 924
receive copies of the public records requested within a 925
specified period of time but failed to fulfill that promise 926
within that specified period of time. 927
(iii) The public office or the person responsible for the 928

S. B. No. 236 Page 33
As Introduced
public records acted in bad faith when the office or person 929
voluntarily made the public records available to the relator for 930
the first time after the relator commenced the mandamus action, 931
but before the court issued any order concluding whether or not 932
the public office or person was required to comply with division 933
(B) of this section. No discovery may be conducted on the issue 934
of the alleged bad faith of the public office or person 935
responsible for the public records. This division shall not be 936
construed as creating a presumption that the public office or 937
the person responsible for the public records acted in bad faith 938
when the office or person voluntarily made the public records 939
available to the relator for the first time after the relator 940
commenced the mandamus action, but before the court issued any 941
order described in this division. 942
(c) The court shall not award attorney's fees to the 943
relator if the court determines both of the following: 944
(i) That, based on the ordinary application of statutory 945
law and case law as it existed at the time of the conduct or 946
threatened conduct of the public office or person responsible 947
for the requested public records that allegedly constitutes a 948
failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 949
(B) of this section and that was the basis of the mandamus 950
action, a well-informed public office or person responsible for 951
the requested public records reasonably would believe that the 952
conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or person 953
responsible for the requested public records did not constitute 954
a failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with 955
division (B) of this section; 956
(ii) That a well-informed public office or person 957
responsible for the requested public records reasonably would 958

S. B. No. 236 Page 34
As Introduced
believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of the public 959
office or person responsible for the requested public records 960
would serve the public policy that underlies the authority that 961
is asserted as permitting that conduct or threatened conduct. 962
(5) All of the following apply to any award of reasonable 963
attorney's fees awarded under division (C)(4)(b) of this 964
section: 965
(a) The fees shall be construed as remedial and not 966
punitive. 967
(b) The fees awarded shall not exceed the total of the 968
reasonable attorney's fees incurred before the public record was 969
made available to the relator and the fees described in division 970
(C)(5)(c) of this section. 971
(c) Reasonable attorney's fees shall include reasonable 972
fees incurred to produce proof of the reasonableness and amount 973
of the fees and to otherwise litigate entitlement to the fees. 974
(d) The court may reduce the amount of fees awarded if the 975
court determines that, given the factual circumstances involved 976
with the specific public records request, an alternative means 977
should have been pursued to more effectively and efficiently 978
resolve the dispute that was subject to the mandamus action 979
filed under division (C)(1) of this section. 980
(6) If the court does not issue a writ of mandamus under 981
division (C) of this section and the court determines at that 982
time that the bringing of the mandamus action was frivolous 983
conduct as defined in division (A) of section 2323.51 of the 984
Revised Code, the court may award to the public office all court 985
costs, expenses, and reasonable attorney's fees, as determined 986
by the court. 987

division (B) of this section, all elected officials or their 992
appropriate designees shall attend training approved by the 993

public records policy developed and provided to the public 1003
office by the attorney general under section 109.43 of the 1004

policy may not limit the number of public records that the 1006
public office will make available to a single person, may not 1007
limit the number of public records that it will make available 1008

less than eight hours. 1012
The public office shall distribute the public records 1013
policy adopted by the public office under this division to the 1014

complaint with the clerk of the court of claims pursuant to 1098
section 2743.75 of the Revised Code, requesting the court to 1099
order the release of all or portions of the recording. If the 1100
court considering the request determines that the filing 1101
articulates by clear and convincing evidence that the public 1102
interest in the recording substantially outweighs privacy 1103
interests and other interests asserted to deny release, the 1104
court shall order the public office to release the recording. 1105
