subsidized health plan maintained by any employer of the 72
taxpayer or of the taxpayer's spouse, or to any taxpayer who is 73

dependents, to the extent the expenses exceed seven and one-half 88
per cent of the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income. 89
(c) For purposes of division (A)(10) of this section, 90

of the Internal Revenue Code. Solely for purposes of division 95
(A)(10)(a) of this section, "dependent" includes a person who 96
otherwise would be a "qualifying relative" and thus a 97
"dependent" under section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code but 98
for the fact that the person fails to meet the income and 99
support limitations under section 152(d)(1)(B) and (C) of the 100

States department of the treasury regulations. The deduction 107
otherwise allowed under division (A)(11)(a) of this section 108

S. B. No. 89 Page 5

shall be reduced to the extent the reimbursement is attributable 109
to an amount the taxpayer deducted under this section in any 110
taxable year. 111
(b) Add any amount not otherwise included in Ohio adjusted 112
gross income for any taxable year to the extent that the amount 113
is attributable to the recovery during the taxable year of any 114
amount deducted or excluded in computing federal or Ohio 115
adjusted gross income in any taxable year. 116
(12) Deduct any portion of the deduction described in 117
section 1341(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, for repaying 118
previously reported income received under a claim of right, that 119
meets both of the following requirements: 120
(a) It is allowable for repayment of an item that was 121
included in the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for a prior 122
taxable year and did not qualify for a credit under division (A) 123
or (B) of section 5747.05 of the Revised Code for that year; 124
(b) It does not otherwise reduce the taxpayer's adjusted 125
gross income for the current or any other taxable year. 126
(13) Deduct an amount equal to the deposits made to, and 127
net investment earnings of, a medical savings account during the 128
taxable year, in accordance with section 3924.66 of the Revised 129
Code. The deduction allowed by division (A)(13) of this section 130

medical savings account during the taxable year, and the net 135
investment earnings on those funds, when the funds withdrawn 136

Code during the taxable year. 142
(15) Add any amount claimed as a credit under section 143
5747.059 of the Revised Code to the extent that such amount 144
satisfies either of the following: 145
(a) The amount was deducted or excluded from the 146
computation of the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income as 147
required to be reported for the taxpayer's taxable year under 148
the Internal Revenue Code; 149
(b) The amount resulted in a reduction of the taxpayer's 150
federal adjusted gross income as required to be reported for any 151
of the taxpayer's taxable years under the Internal Revenue Code. 152
(16) Deduct the amount contributed by the taxpayer to an 153
individual development account program established by a county 154
department of job and family services pursuant to sections 155
329.11 to 329.14 of the Revised Code for the purpose of matching 156
funds deposited by program participants. On request of the tax 157

in the tax commissioner's opinion, is necessary to establish the 159
amount deducted under division (A)(16) of this section. 160

Revenue Code and by qualifying section 179 depreciation expense, 199

property for the purpose of determining the credit under 213
division (A) of section 5747.05 of the Revised Code. Otherwise, 214

If the allocation and apportionment of a trust's income 987
under divisions (AA)(4)(a) and (c) of this section do not fairly 988
represent the modified Ohio taxable income of the trust in this 989
state, the alternative methods described in division (C) of 990

and for the purpose of computing the fraction described in 998
division (AA)(4)(b) of this section, all of the following apply: 999
(i) If the qualifying investee is a member of a qualifying 1000
controlled group on the last day of the qualifying investee's 1001
fiscal or calendar year ending immediately prior to the date on 1002
which the trust recognizes the gain or loss, then "qualifying 1003
investee" includes all persons in the qualifying controlled 1004
group on such last day. 1005
(ii) If the qualifying investee, or if the qualifying 1006
investee and any members of the qualifying controlled group of 1007

recognizes the qualifying trust amount, more than fifty per cent 1014

investee and the other members are deemed to own the 1016
proportionate share of the pass-through entity's physical assets 1017
which the pass-through entity directly or indirectly owns on the 1018
last day of the pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year 1019

also a qualifying investee, is deemed to own, on the last day of 1029
the upper level pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year, 1030
the proportionate share of the lower level pass-through entity's 1031
physical assets that the lower level pass-through entity 1032
directly or indirectly owns on the last day of the lower level 1033
pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year ending within or 1034
with the last day of the upper level pass-through entity's 1035
fiscal or calendar year. If the upper level pass-through entity 1036
directly and indirectly owns less than fifty per cent of the 1037
equity of the lower level pass-through entity on each day of the 1038
upper level pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year in 1039
which or with which ends the calendar or fiscal year of the 1040
lower level pass-through entity and if, based upon clear and 1041
convincing evidence, complete information about the location and 1042
cost of the physical assets of the lower pass-through entity is 1043
not available to the upper level pass-through entity, then 1044

S. B. No. 89 Page 37
As Introduced
solely for purposes of ascertaining if a gain or loss 1045
constitutes a qualifying trust amount, the upper level pass- 1046
through entity shall be deemed as owning no equity of the lower 1047
level pass-through entity for each day during the upper level 1048
pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year in which or with 1049
which ends the lower level pass-through entity's calendar or 1050
fiscal year. Nothing in division (AA)(5)(a)(iii) of this section 1051
shall be construed to provide for any deduction or exclusion in 1052
computing any trust's Ohio taxable income. 1053
(b) With respect to a trust that is not a resident for the 1054
taxable year and with respect to a part of a trust that is not a 1055
resident for the taxable year, "qualifying investee" for that 1056
taxable year does not include a C corporation if both of the 1057
following apply: 1058
(i) During the taxable year the trust or part of the trust 1059
recognizes a gain or loss from the sale, exchange, or other 1060
disposition of equity or ownership interests in, or debt 1061
obligations of, the C corporation. 1062
(ii) Such gain or loss constitutes nonbusiness income. 1063
