In memory of Mary Rose Oakar.
WHEREAS, The members of the House of Representatives of the 136th 1
General Assembly of Ohio were deeply saddened to learn of the death of 2
Mary Rose Oakar and pay tribute to her memory; and 3
WHEREAS, Mary Oakar will be remembered fondly by all those who 4
knew her, and her absence will leave an irreparable void in our 5
society. A teacher at Lourdes Academy and Cuyahoga Community College 6
before being elected to the Cleveland City Council in 1973, she was 7
celebrated for her integrity, her dedication to women’s economic 8
equality, and her ability to break barriers, and she brought a wealth 9
of knowledge and a heart for the public welfare into all of her 10
endeavors to benefit the State of Ohio; and 11

H. R. No. 255 Page 2
As Adopted by the House
WHEREAS, In 1977, Mary Oakar was sworn into the Ohio House of 12
Representatives, and over the course of her sixteen-year tenure, she 13
served on the Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs Committee, the 14
Banking Subcommittee on Economic Stabilization, the House Select 15
Committee on Aging, the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, and 16
the House Administration Committee, sponsored legislation to improve 17
public housing, fight elder abuse, and secure federal funding for 18
breast cancer research, and advocated for the NASA Glenn Research 19
Center, the protection of Lake Erie, and the campaign to bring the 20
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to Cleveland. Indeed, she garnered the 21
respect of her peers as well as her constituents, and her stalwart 22
legacy to our state will endure as a testament to her passion for 23
community service as well as her positive philosophy to public life; 24
and 25
WHEREAS, Also a member of the Ohio House of Representatives and 26
the White House Conference on Aging, Mary Rose Oakar made a lasting 27
impression through her leadership, and she exemplified the belief that 28
the power of elected officials to enrich and strengthen the 29
communities they represented would be best achieved by working 30
together. Without a doubt, she will be remembered for her visionary 31
example of citizenship and her life’s work, which has exponentially 32
benefited the State of Ohio; therefore be it 33
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the House of Representatives of 34
the 136th General Assembly of Ohio, in adopting this Resolution, offer 35
our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Mary Rose Oakar 36
and express a profound sense of loss and sincere regret on the 37
sorrowful occasion of her death; and be it further 38
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives transmit 39
a duly authenticated copy of this Resolution to the family of Mary 40
Rose Oakar. 41
