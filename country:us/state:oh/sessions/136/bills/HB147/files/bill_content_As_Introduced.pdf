BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF OHIO:
Section 1. That sections 5739.02 and 5739.03 of the 6
Revised Code be amended to read as follows: 7
Sec. 5739.02. For the purpose of providing revenue with 8
which to meet the needs of the state, for the use of the general 9
revenue fund of the state, for the purpose of securing a 10
thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the 11
state, for the purpose of affording revenues, in addition to 12
those from general property taxes, permitted under 13
constitutional limitations, and from other sources, for the 14
support of local governmental functions, and for the purpose of 15
reimbursing the state for the expense of administering this 16
chapter, an excise tax is hereby levied on each retail sale made 17
in this state. 18
(A)(1) The tax shall be collected as provided in section 19

H. B. No. 147 Page 2
As Introduced
5739.025 of the Revised Code. The rate of the tax shall be five 20
and three-fourths per cent. The tax applies and is collectible 21
when the sale is made, regardless of the time when the price is 22
paid or delivered. 23
(2) In the case of the lease or rental, with a fixed term 24
of more than thirty days or an indefinite term with a minimum 25
period of more than thirty days, of any motor vehicles designed 26
by the manufacturer to carry a load of not more than one ton, 27
watercraft, outboard motor, or aircraft, or of any tangible 28
personal property, other than motor vehicles designed by the 29
manufacturer to carry a load of more than one ton, to be used by 30
the lessee or renter primarily for business purposes, the tax 31
shall be collected by the vendor at the time the lease or rental 32
is consummated and shall be calculated by the vendor on the 33
basis of the total amount to be paid by the lessee or renter 34
under the lease agreement. If the total amount of the 35
consideration for the lease or rental includes amounts that are 36
not calculated at the time the lease or rental is executed, the 37
tax shall be calculated and collected by the vendor at the time 38
such amounts are billed to the lessee or renter. In the case of 39
an open-end lease or rental, the tax shall be calculated by the 40
vendor on the basis of the total amount to be paid during the 41
initial fixed term of the lease or rental, and for each 42
subsequent renewal period as it comes due. As used in this 43
division, "motor vehicle" has the same meaning as in section 44
4501.01 of the Revised Code, and "watercraft" includes an 45
outdrive unit attached to the watercraft. 46
A lease with a renewal clause and a termination penalty or 47
similar provision that applies if the renewal clause is not 48
exercised is presumed to be a sham transaction. In such a case, 49
the tax shall be calculated and paid on the basis of the entire 50

H. B. No. 147 Page 3

length of the lease period, including any renewal periods, until 51
the termination penalty or similar provision no longer applies. 52
The taxpayer shall bear the burden, by a preponderance of the 53
evidence, that the transaction or series of transactions is not 54
a sham transaction. 55
(3) Except as provided in division (A)(2) of this section, 56
in the case of a sale, the price of which consists in whole or 57
in part of the lease or rental of tangible personal property, 58
the tax shall be measured by the installments of that lease or 59
rental. 60
(4) In the case of a sale of a physical fitness facility 61
service or recreation and sports club service, the price of 62
which consists in whole or in part of a membership for the 63
receipt of the benefit of the service, the tax applicable to the 64
sale shall be measured by the installments thereof. 65

to section 5739.41 of the Revised Code. 913
(C) For the purpose of the proper administration of this 914
chapter, and to prevent the evasion of the tax, it is presumed 915
that all sales made in this state are subject to the tax until 916
the contrary is established. 917
(D) The tax collected by the vendor from the consumer 918
under this chapter is not part of the price, but is a tax 919
collection for the benefit of the state, and of counties levying 920
an additional sales tax pursuant to section 5739.021 or 5739.026 921
of the Revised Code and of transit authorities levying an 922
additional sales tax pursuant to section 5739.023 of the Revised 923
Code. Except for the discount authorized under section 5739.12 924
of the Revised Code and the effects of any rounding pursuant to 925
section 5703.055 of the Revised Code, no person other than the 926

state or such a county or transit authority shall derive any 927
benefit from the collection or payment of the tax levied by this 928
section or section 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 of the 929
Revised Code. 930
Sec. 5739.03. (A) Except as provided in section 5739.05 or 931
section 5739.051 of the Revised Code, the tax imposed by or 932
pursuant to section 5739.02, 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 of 933
the Revised Code shall be paid by the consumer to the vendor, 934
and each vendor shall collect from the consumer, as a trustee 935
for the state of Ohio, the full and exact amount of the tax 936
payable on each taxable sale, in the manner and at the times 937
provided as follows: 938
(1) If the price is, at or prior to the provision of the 939
service or the delivery of possession of the thing sold to the 940
consumer, paid in currency passed from hand to hand by the 941
consumer or the consumer's agent to the vendor or the vendor's 942
agent, the vendor or the vendor's agent shall collect the tax 943
with and at the same time as the price; 944
(2) If the price is otherwise paid or to be paid, the 945
vendor or the vendor's agent shall, at or prior to the provision 946
of the service or the delivery of possession of the thing sold 947
to the consumer, charge the tax imposed by or pursuant to 948
section 5739.02, 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 of the Revised 949
Code to the account of the consumer, which amount shall be 950
collected by the vendor from the consumer in addition to the 951
price. Such sale shall be reported on and the amount of the tax 952
applicable thereto shall be remitted with the return for the 953
period in which the sale is made, and the amount of the tax 954
shall become a legal charge in favor of the vendor and against 955
the consumer. 956

(B)(1)(a) If any sale is claimed to be exempt under 957
division (E) of section 5739.01 of the Revised Code or under 958
section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, with the exception of 959
divisions (B)(1) to (11), (28), (48), (55), (59), or (66) of 960
section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, the consumer must provide 961
to the vendor, and the vendor must obtain from the consumer, a 962
certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally 963
subject to the tax. The certificate shall be in such form, and 964
shall be provided either in a hard copy form or electronic form, 965
as the tax commissioner prescribes. 966
(b) A vendor that obtains a fully completed exemption 967
certificate from a consumer is relieved of liability for 968
collecting and remitting tax on any sale covered by that 969
certificate. If it is determined the exemption was improperly 970
claimed, the consumer shall be liable for any tax due on that 971
sale under section 5739.02, 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 or 972
Chapter 5741. of the Revised Code. Relief under this division 973
from liability does not apply to any of the following: 974
(i) A vendor that fraudulently fails to collect tax; 975
(ii) A vendor that solicits consumers to participate in 976
the unlawful claim of an exemption; 977
(iii) A vendor that accepts an exemption certificate from 978
a consumer that claims an exemption based on who purchases or 979
who sells property or a service, when the subject of the 980
transaction sought to be covered by the exemption certificate is 981
actually received by the consumer at a location operated by the 982
vendor in this state, and this state has posted to its web site 983
an exemption certificate form that clearly and affirmatively 984
indicates that the claimed exemption is not available in this 985
state; 986

H. B. No. 147 Page 35
As Introduced
(iv) A vendor that accepts an exemption certificate from a 987
consumer who claims a multiple points of use exemption under 988
division (D) of section 5739.033 of the Revised Code, if the 989
item purchased is tangible personal property, other than 990
prewritten computer software. 991
(2) The vendor shall maintain records, including exemption 992
certificates, of all sales on which a consumer has claimed an 993
exemption, and provide them to the tax commissioner on request. 994
(3) The tax commissioner may establish an identification 995
system whereby the commissioner issues an identification number 996
to a consumer that is exempt from payment of the tax. The 997
consumer must present the number to the vendor, if any sale is 998
claimed to be exempt as provided in this section. 999
(4) If no certificate is provided or obtained within 1000
ninety days after the date on which such sale is consummated, it 1001
shall be presumed that the tax applies. Failure to have so 1002
provided or obtained a certificate shall not preclude a vendor, 1003
within one hundred twenty days after the tax commissioner gives 1004
written notice of intent to levy an assessment, from either 1005
establishing that the sale is not subject to the tax, or 1006
obtaining, in good faith, a fully completed exemption 1007
certificate. 1008
(5) Certificates need not be obtained nor provided where 1009
the identity of the consumer is such that the transaction is 1010
never subject to the tax imposed or where the item of tangible 1011
personal property sold or the service provided is never subject 1012
to the tax imposed, regardless of use, or when the sale is in 1013
interstate commerce. 1014
(6) If a transaction is claimed to be exempt under 1015

H. B. No. 147 Page 36
As Introduced
division (B)(13) of section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, the 1016
contractor shall obtain certification of the claimed exemption 1017
from the contractee. This certification shall be in addition to 1018
an exemption certificate provided by the contractor to the 1019
vendor. A contractee that provides a certification under this 1020
division shall be deemed to be the consumer of all items 1021
purchased by the contractor under the claim of exemption, if it 1022
is subsequently determined that the exemption is not properly 1023
claimed. The certification shall be in such form as the tax 1024
commissioner prescribes. 1025
(7) If a transaction is claimed to be exempt under 1026
division (B)(13)(B)(13)(e) of section 5739.02 of the Revised 1027
Code, the person that leases a sports facility, as defined in 1028
section 307.696 of the Revised Code, wholly owned by a county 1029
may provide and sign, on behalf of the county, an exemption 1030
certificate required under this section for that exemption. 1031
(C) As used in this division, "contractee" means a person 1032
who seeks to enter or enters into a contract or agreement with a 1033
contractor or vendor for the construction of real property or 1034
for the sale and installation onto real property of tangible 1035
personal property. 1036
Any contractor or vendor may request from any contractee a 1037
certification of what portion of the property to be transferred 1038
under such contract or agreement is to be incorporated into the 1039
realty and what portion will retain its status as tangible 1040
personal property after installation is completed. The 1041
contractor or vendor shall request the certification by 1042
certified mail delivered to the contractee, return receipt 1043
requested. Upon receipt of such request and prior to entering 1044
into the contract or agreement, the contractee shall provide to 1045

H. B. No. 147 Page 37
As Introduced
the contractor or vendor a certification sufficiently detailed 1046
to enable the contractor or vendor to ascertain the resulting 1047
classification of all materials purchased or fabricated by the 1048
contractor or vendor and transferred to the contractee. This 1049
requirement applies to a contractee regardless of whether the 1050
contractee holds a direct payment permit under section 5739.031 1051
of the Revised Code or provides to the contractor or vendor an 1052
exemption certificate as provided under this section. 1053
For the purposes of the taxes levied by this chapter and 1054
Chapter 5741. of the Revised Code, the contractor or vendor may 1055
in good faith rely on the contractee's certification. 1056
Notwithstanding division (B) of section 5739.01 of the Revised 1057
Code, if the tax commissioner determines that certain property 1058
certified by the contractee as tangible personal property 1059
pursuant to this division is, in fact, real property, the 1060
contractee shall be considered to be the consumer of all 1061
materials so incorporated into that real property and shall be 1062
liable for the applicable tax, and the contractor or vendor 1063
shall be excused from any liability on those materials. 1064
If a contractee fails to provide such certification upon 1065
the request of the contractor or vendor, the contractor or 1066
vendor shall comply with the provisions of this chapter and 1067
Chapter 5741. of the Revised Code without the certification. If 1068
the tax commissioner determines that such compliance has been 1069
performed in good faith and that certain property treated as 1070
tangible personal property by the contractor or vendor is, in 1071
fact, real property, the contractee shall be considered to be 1072
the consumer of all materials so incorporated into that real 1073
property and shall be liable for the applicable tax, and the 1074
construction contractor or vendor shall be excused from any 1075
liability on those materials. 1076

H. B. No. 147 Page 38
As Introduced
This division does not apply to any contract or agreement 1077
where the tax commissioner determines as a fact that a 1078
certification under this division was made solely on the 1079
decision or advice of the contractor or vendor. 1080
(D) Notwithstanding division (B) of section 5739.01 of the 1081
Revised Code, whenever the total rate of tax imposed under this 1082
chapter is increased after the date after a construction 1083
contract is entered into, the contractee shall reimburse the 1084
construction contractor for any additional tax paid on tangible 1085
property consumed or services received pursuant to the contract. 1086
(E) A vendor who files a petition for reassessment 1087
contesting the assessment of tax on sales for which the vendor 1088
obtained no valid exemption certificates and for which the 1089
vendor failed to establish that the sales were properly not 1090
subject to the tax during the one-hundred-twenty-day period 1091
allowed under division (B) of this section, may present to the 1092
tax commissioner additional evidence to prove that the sales 1093
were properly subject to a claim of exception or exemption. The 1094
vendor shall file such evidence within ninety days of the 1095
receipt by the vendor of the notice of assessment, except that, 1096
upon application and for reasonable cause, the period for 1097
submitting such evidence shall be extended thirty days. 1098
The commissioner shall consider such additional evidence 1099
in reaching the final determination on the assessment and 1100
petition for reassessment. 1101
(F) Whenever a vendor refunds the price, minus any 1102
separately stated delivery charge, of an item of tangible 1103
personal property on which the tax imposed under this chapter 1104
has been paid, the vendor shall also refund the amount of tax 1105
paid, minus the amount of tax attributable to the delivery 1106
