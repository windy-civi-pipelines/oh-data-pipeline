requirements of this section and rules adopted under it, the 385
director may establish in the agreement environmental and 386

in the agreement for financial assistance or otherwise violates 390
a term or condition of the agreement or of the plan approval for 391
the project under section 6109.07 of the Revised Code, the 392
