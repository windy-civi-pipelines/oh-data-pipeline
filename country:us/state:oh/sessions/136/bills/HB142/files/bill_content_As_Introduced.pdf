include, with respect to a natural gas, water-works, or sewage 171
disposal system company, projected valuation and value as of the 172
date certain, if applicable because of a future date or dates 173
certain under section 4909.15 of the Revised Code. 174
Sec. 4909.07. The public utilities commission, during the 175
making of the valuation provided for in sections 4909.04 to 176
4909.13 of the Revised Code, and after its completion, shall in 177
like manner keep itself informed through its engineers, experts, 178
and other assistants of all extensions, improvements, or other 179
changes in the condition and value of the property of all public 180
utilities or railroads and shall ascertain the value of such 181
extensions, improvements, and changes. The commission shall, as 182
is required for the proper regulation of such public utilities 183
or railroads, revise and correct its valuations of property, 184
showing such revisions and corrections as a whole and as to each 185
county. Such revisions and corrections shall be filed in the 186
same manner as original reports. 187
"Valuation" and "value," as used in this section, may 188
include, with respect to a natural gas, water-works, or sewage 189
disposal system company, projected valuation and value as of the 190
date certain, if applicable because of a future date or dates 191
certain under section 4909.15 of the Revised Code. 192
Sec. 4909.08. When the public utilities commission has 193
completed the valuation of the property of any public utility or 194
railroad and before such valuation becomes final, it shall give 195
notice by registered letter to such public utility or railroad, 196
and if a substantial portion of said public utility or railroad 197

H. B. No. 142 Page 8

or railroad and upon the property as a whole and give such 201
further notice by publication or otherwise as it shall deem 202
necessary to apprise the public of such valuation. If, within 203
thirty days after such notification, no protest has been filed 204
with the commission, such valuation becomes final. If notice of 205
protest has been filed by any public utility or railroad, the 206
commission shall fix a time for hearing such protest and shall 207
consider at such hearing any matter material thereto presented 208
by such public utility, railroad, or municipal corporation, in 209
support of its protest or by any representative of the public 210
against such protest. If, after the hearing of any protest of 211
any valuation so fixed, the commission is of the opinion that 212
its inventory is incomplete or inaccurate or that its valuation 213
is incorrect, it shall make such changes as are necessary and 214
shall issue an order making such corrected valuations final. A 215
final valuation by the commission and all classifications made 216
for the ascertainment of such valuations shall be public and are 217
prima-facie evidence relative to the value of the property. 218
"Valuation" and "value," as used in this section, may 219
include, with respect to a natural gas, water-works, or sewage 220
disposal system company, projected valuation and value as of the 221
date certain, if applicable because of a future date or dates 222
certain under section 4909.15 of the Revised Code. 223
Sec. 4909.15. (A) The public utilities commission, when 224
fixing and determining just and reasonable rates, fares, tolls, 225
rentals, and charges, shall determine: 226
(1) The valuation as of the date certain of the property 227
of the public utility used and useful or, with respect to a 228
natural gas, water-works, or sewage disposal system company, 229
projected to be used and useful as of the date certain or, as 230

H. B. No. 142 Page 9
As Introduced
provided for in division (E) of this section, as of the dates 231
certain, in rendering the public utility service for which rates 232
are to be fixed and determined. The valuation so determined 233
shall be the total value as set forth in division (C)(9) of 234
section 4909.05 of the Revised Code, and a reasonable allowance 235
for materials and supplies and cash working capital as 236
determined by the commission. 237
The commission, in its discretion, may include in the 238
valuation a reasonable allowance for construction work in 239
progress but, in no event, may such an allowance be made by the 240
commission until it has determined that the particular 241
construction project is at least seventy-five per cent complete. 242
In determining the percentage completion of a particular 243
construction project, the commission shall consider, among other 244
relevant criteria, the per cent of time elapsed in construction; 245
the per cent of construction funds, excluding allowance for 246
funds used during construction, expended, or obligated to such 247
construction funds budgeted where all such funds are adjusted to 248
reflect current purchasing power; and any physical inspection 249
performed by or on behalf of any party, including the 250
commission's staff. 251
A reasonable allowance for construction work in progress 252
shall not exceed ten per cent of the total valuation as stated 253
in this division, not including such allowance for construction 254
work in progress. 255
Where the commission permits an allowance for construction 256
work in progress, the dollar value of the project or portion 257
thereof included in the valuation as construction work in 258
progress shall not be included in the valuation as plant in 259
service until such time as the total revenue effect of the 260

H. B. No. 142 Page 10
As Introduced
construction work in progress allowance is offset by the total 261
revenue effect of the plant in service exclusion. Carrying 262
charges calculated in a manner similar to allowance for funds 263
used during construction shall accrue on that portion of the 264
project in service but not reflected in rates as plant in 265
service, and such accrued carrying charges shall be included in 266
the valuation of the property at the conclusion of the offset 267
period for purposes of division (C)(9) of section 4909.05 of the 268
Revised Code. 269
From and after April 10, 1985, no allowance for 270
construction work in progress as it relates to a particular 271
construction project shall be reflected in rates for a period 272
exceeding forty-eight consecutive months commencing on the date 273
the initial rates reflecting such allowance become effective, 274
except as otherwise provided in this division. 275
The applicable maximum period in rates for an allowance 276
for construction work in progress as it relates to a particular 277
construction project shall be tolled if, and to the extent, a 278
delay in the in-service date of the project is caused by the 279
action or inaction of any federal, state, county, or municipal 280
agency having jurisdiction, where such action or inaction 281
relates to a change in a rule, standard, or approval of such 282
agency, and where such action or inaction is not the result of 283
the failure of the utility to reasonably endeavor to comply with 284
any rule, standard, or approval prior to such change. 285
In the event that such period expires before the project 286
goes into service, the commission shall exclude, from the date 287
of expiration, the allowance for the project as construction 288
work in progress from rates, except that the commission may 289
extend the expiration date up to twelve months for good cause 290

shown. 291
In the event that a utility has permanently canceled, 292
abandoned, or terminated construction of a project for which it 293
was previously permitted a construction work in progress 294
allowance, the commission immediately shall exclude the 295
allowance for the project from the valuation. 296
In the event that a construction work in progress project 297
previously included in the valuation is removed from the 298
valuation pursuant to this division, any revenues collected by 299
the utility from its customers after April 10, 1985, that 300
resulted from such prior inclusion shall be offset against 301
future revenues over the same period of time as the project was 302
included in the valuation as construction work in progress. The 303
total revenue effect of such offset shall not exceed the total 304
revenues previously collected. 305
In no event shall the total revenue effect of any offset 306
or offsets provided under division (A)(1) of this section exceed 307
the total revenue effect of any construction work in progress 308
allowance. 309
(2) A fair and reasonable rate of return to the utility on 310
the valuation as determined in division (A)(1) of this section 311
and based on the capital structure of the public utility as of 312
the date certain or, as provided for in division (E) of this 313
section, as of the dates certain; 314
(3) The dollar annual return to which the utility is 315
entitled by applying the fair and reasonable rate of return as 316
determined under division (A)(2) of this section to the 317
valuation of the utility determined under division (A)(1) of 318
this section; 319

(4) The cost to the utility of rendering the public 320
utility service for the test period used for the determination 321
under division (C)(1) of this section, less the total of any 322
interest on cash or credit refunds paid, pursuant to section 323
4909.42 of the Revised Code, by the utility during the test 324
period. 325
(a) Federal, state, and local taxes imposed on or measured 326
by net income may, in the discretion of the commission, be 327
computed by the normalization method of accounting, provided the 328
utility maintains accounting reserves that reflect differences 329
between taxes actually payable and taxes on a normalized basis, 330
provided that no determination as to the treatment in the rate- 331
making process of such taxes shall be made that will result in 332
loss of any tax depreciation or other tax benefit to which the 333
utility would otherwise be entitled, and further provided that 334
such tax benefit as redounds to the utility as a result of such 335
a computation may not be retained by the company, used to fund 336
any dividend or distribution, or utilized for any purpose other 337
than the defrayal of the operating expenses of the utility and 338
the defrayal of the expenses of the utility in connection with 339
construction work. 340
(b) The amount of any tax credits granted to an electric 341
light company under section 5727.391 of the Revised Code for 342
Ohio coal burned prior to January 1, 2000, shall not be retained 343
by the company, used to fund any dividend or distribution, or 344
utilized for any purposes other than the defrayal of the 345
allowable operating expenses of the company and the defrayal of 346
the allowable expenses of the company in connection with the 347
installation, acquisition, construction, or use of a compliance 348
facility. The amount of the tax credits granted to an electric 349
light company under that section for Ohio coal burned prior to 350

years after initially claiming the credit through an offset to 352
the company's rates or fuel component, as determined by the 353
commission, as set forth in schedules filed by the company under 354
section 4905.30 of the Revised Code. As used in division (A)(4) 355
(b) of this section, "compliance facility" has the same meaning 356
as in section 5727.391 of the Revised Code. 357
(B) The commission shall compute the gross annual revenues 358
to which the utility is entitled by adding the dollar amount of 359
return under division (A)(3) of this section to the cost, for 360
the test period used for the determination under division (C)(1) 361
of this section, of rendering the public utility service under 362
division (A)(4) of this section. 363
(C)(1) Except as provided in division divisions (D) and 364
(E) of this section, the revenues and expenses of the utility 365
shall be determined during a test period. The Unless another 366
period is permitted under division (E) of this section, the 367
utility may propose a test period for this determination that is 368
any twelve-month period beginning not more than six months prior 369
to the date the application is filed and ending not more than 370
nine months subsequent to that date. The test period for 371
determining revenues and expenses of the utility shall be the 372
test period proposed by the utility, unless otherwise ordered by 373
the commission determines that the proposed test period does not 374
comply with the requirements of divisions (C) to (E) of this 375
section. 376
(2) The Except as provided for in division (E) of this 377
section, the date certain shall be not later than the date of 378
filing, except that it shall be, for a natural gas, water-works, 379
or sewage disposal system company, not later than the end of the 380

be determined under division (C)(1) of this section for any 384
changes that are, during the test period or the twelve-month 385
period immediately following the test period, reasonably 386
expected to occur. The natural gas, water-works, or sewage 387

incorporate the proposed adjustments into the determination if 390
the adjustments are just and reasonable. 391

shall approve, a test period that is any twelve-month period 393
beginning not earlier than twelve months prior to the date the 394
application was filed and ending not later than twenty-four 395
months from the date the application was filed. The commission 396

is not greater than twelve months from the filing date of the 400
application, then the natural gas company may propose, and the 401
commission shall approve, two dates certain as follows: 402

shall take effect. If it appears to the commission that the 601
proposals in the application may be unjust or unreasonable, the 602
commission shall set the matter for hearing and shall give 603
notice of such hearing by sending written notice of the date set 604

violated any provision of section 4928.17 of the Revised Code or 755
an order issued or rule adopted under that section. For this 756
purpose, the commission may examine such books, accounts, or 757
other records kept by an electric utility or its affiliate as 758
may relate to the businesses for which corporate separation is 759
required under section 4928.17 of the Revised Code, and may 760

places into service investments that perform the function that 857
had been provided by the exempt investments prior to the 858
granting of the regulatory exemption, the company shall not be 859
