Fiftieth Anniversary.
WHEREAS, The members of the Senate of the 136th General Assembly 1
of Ohio are pleased to congratulate the Village of Tontogany on the 2
auspicious occasion of its Sesquicentennial; and 3
WHEREAS, America is only as strong as her individual communities, 4
which are unique and which make significant contributions to the 5
culture of our state and nation. Incorporated in 1875 and named after 6
Chief Tondoganie from the Ottawa Indian Tribe, the Village of 7
Tontogany has experienced dramatic growth and change, and yet, 8
commendably, it has retained the many engaging qualities that have 9
endeared it to generations of inhabitants. Clearly, it has built on 10
the best traditions of the past to ensure a future filled with hope 11
and promise; and 12
WHEREAS, Over the past century and a half, the Village of 13
Tontogany has enjoyed the benefits of a generous and civic-minded 14
population, and those who currently make the community their home take 15
great pride in its rich heritage and its many local landmarks. Indeed, 16
they have exhibited cooperation, integrity, and a willingness to work 17
hard, and their efforts have certainly made the area a pleasant and 18
friendly place in which to live; and 19
WHEREAS, The One Hundred Fiftieth Anniversary of the Village of 20
Tontogany offers its citizens the opportunity to share their memories 21
and experiences and to reflect on life in their close-knit community. 22
A vigorous commitment to public service and an earnest devotion to 23
lofty ideals have long been second nature to many of the village 24
residents, and vigilance, industriousness, and generosity have come to 25
typify their collective character; therefore be it 26
