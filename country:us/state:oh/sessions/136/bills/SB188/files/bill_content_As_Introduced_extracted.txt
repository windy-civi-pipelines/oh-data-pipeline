authorized or required for the offense, an additional definite 439
prison term of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, 440
nine, or ten years if all of the following criteria are met: 441
(i) The offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a 442
specification of the type described in section 2941.149 of the 443
Revised Code that the offender is a repeat violent offender. 444

section applies, in addition to the longest minimum prison term 438
authorized or required for the offense, an additional definite 439
prison term of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, 440
nine, or ten years if all of the following criteria are met: 441
(i) The offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a 442
specification of the type described in section 2941.149 of the 443
Revised Code that the offender is a repeat violent offender. 444

offender's conduct is more serious than conduct normally 474
constituting the offense are present, and they outweigh the 475

terrorism and the court does not impose a sentence of life 503
imprisonment without parole, any felony of the first degree that 504

other provision of Chapter 2967. or Chapter 5120. of the Revised 518

for purposes of section 2929.15 of the Revised Code, and all 1052
provisions of the Revised Code that pertain to community control 1053
sanctions shall apply to a sanction imposed under this division, 1054
except to the extent that they would by their nature be clearly 1055
inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs associated with a 1056
sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of the 1057
use of the monitoring device. 1058
(I) At the time of sentencing, the court may recommend the 1059
offender for placement in a program of shock incarceration under 1060
section 5120.031 of the Revised Code or for placement in an 1061
intensive program prison under section 5120.032 of the Revised 1062
Code, disapprove placement of the offender in a program of shock 1063
incarceration or an intensive program prison of that nature, or 1064
make no recommendation on placement of the offender. In no case 1065
shall the department of rehabilitation and correction place the 1066
offender in a program or prison of that nature unless the 1067
department determines as specified in section 5120.031 or 1068
5120.032 of the Revised Code, whichever is applicable, that the 1069
offender is eligible for the placement. 1070
If the court disapproves placement of the offender in a 1071
program or prison of that nature, the department of 1072

S. B. No. 188 Page 37
As Introduced
rehabilitation and correction shall not place the offender in 1073
any program of shock incarceration or intensive program prison. 1074
If the court recommends placement of the offender in a 1075
program of shock incarceration or in an intensive program 1076
prison, and if the offender is subsequently placed in the 1077
recommended program or prison, the department shall notify the 1078
court of the placement and shall include with the notice a brief 1079
description of the placement. 1080
If the court recommends placement of the offender in a 1081
program of shock incarceration or in an intensive program prison 1082
and the department does not subsequently place the offender in 1083
the recommended program or prison, the department shall send a 1084
notice to the court indicating why the offender was not placed 1085
in the recommended program or prison. 1086
If the court does not make a recommendation under this 1087
division with respect to an offender and if the department 1088
determines as specified in section 5120.031 or 5120.032 of the 1089
Revised Code, whichever is applicable, that the offender is 1090
eligible for placement in a program or prison of that nature, 1091
the department shall screen the offender and determine if there 1092
is an available program of shock incarceration or an intensive 1093
program prison for which the offender is suited. If there is an 1094
available program of shock incarceration or an intensive program 1095
prison for which the offender is suited, the department shall 1096
notify the court of the proposed placement of the offender as 1097
specified in section 5120.031 or 5120.032 of the Revised Code 1098
and shall include with the notice a brief description of the 1099
placement. The court shall have ten days from receipt of the 1100
notice to disapprove the placement. 1101

aggravated vehicular homicide in violation of division (A)(1) of 1103
section 2903.06 of the Revised Code and division (B)(2)(c) or 1104
(d) of that section applies, the person shall be sentenced 1105
pursuant to section 2929.142 of the Revised Code. 1106
(K)(1) The court shall impose an additional mandatory 1107
prison term of two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 1108
ten, or eleven years on an offender who is convicted of or 1109
pleads guilty to a violent felony offense if the offender also 1110
is convicted of or pleads guilty to a specification of the type 1111
described in section 2941.1424 of the Revised Code that charges 1112
that the offender is a violent career criminal and had a firearm 1113
on or about the offender's person or under the offender's 1114
control while committing the presently charged violent felony 1115
offense and displayed or brandished the firearm, indicated that 1116
the offender possessed a firearm, or used the firearm to 1117
facilitate the offense. The offender shall serve the prison term 1118
imposed under this division consecutively to and prior to the 1119
prison term imposed for the underlying offense. The prison term 1120
shall not be reduced pursuant to section 2929.20, division (A) 1121
(2) or (3) of section 2967.193 or 2967.194, or any other 1122
provision of Chapter 2967. or 5120. of the Revised Code. A court 1123
may not impose more than one sentence under division (B)(2)(a) 1124
of this section and this division for acts committed as part of 1125
the same act or transaction. 1126
(2) As used in division (K)(1) of this section, "violent 1127
career criminal" and "violent felony offense" have the same 1128
meanings as in section 2923.132 of the Revised Code. 1129
(L) If an offender receives or received a sentence of life 1130
imprisonment without parole, a sentence of life imprisonment, a 1131
definite sentence, or a sentence to an indefinite prison term 1132

S. B. No. 188 Page 39

under this chapter for a felony offense that was committed when 1133
the offender was under eighteen years of age, the offender's 1134
parole eligibility shall be determined under section 2967.132 of 1135
the Revised Code. 1136
Section 2. That existing sections 2921.331 and 2929.14 of 1137
the Revised Code are hereby repealed. 1138
Section 3. Section 2929.14 of the Revised Code is 1139
presented in this act as a composite of the section as amended 1140
by H.B. 37, H.B. 56, H.B. 111, and S.B. 106, all of the 135th 1141
General Assembly. The General Assembly, applying the principle 1142
stated in division (B) of section 1.52 of the Revised Code that 1143
amendments are to be harmonized if reasonably capable of 1144
simultaneous operation, finds that the composite is the 1145
resulting version of the section in effect prior to the 1146
effective date of the section as presented in this act. 1147
