are stipulated in the contract. Regardless of the number of 297
renewals of the bond, the aggregate liability under each renewed 298
bond may not exceed the penal sum stated in the renewal 299
certificate for the applicable renewal year. 300

district without a vote of the electors incurred under this and 325
all other sections of the Revised Code, except section 3318.052 326
of the Revised Code, shall not exceed one per cent of the 327
district's tax valuation. Revenues derived from local taxes or 328
otherwise, for the purpose of conserving energy or for defraying 329

division (G)(1) of section 133.06 of the Revised Code as a 342
requirement for issuing energy securities, makes a finding that 343
the amount spent on such measures is not likely to exceed the 344
amount of money it would save in energy costs and resultant 345
operational and maintenance costs as described in that division, 346
except that that finding shall cover the ensuing fifteen years, 347
and the facilities construction commission determines that the 348
district board's findings are reasonable and approves the 349
contract as described in that division. 350
The district board shall monitor the savings and maintain 351
a report of those savings, which shall be submitted to the 352
commission in the same manner as required by division (G) of 353
section 133.06 of the Revised Code in the case of energy 354
securities. 355
(G) A board of education may apply to the Ohio facilities 356
construction commission for a loan from the school energy 357
performance contracting loan fund, established by section 358
3313.378 of the Revised Code, for purposes of paying for all or 359

As Passed by the Senate
(2) "Shared-savings contract" means a contract for one or 371
more energy savings measures, which contract provides that all 372
payments, except payments for maintenance and repairs and 373
obligations on termination of the contract prior to its 374
expiration, are to be a stated percentage of calculated savings 375
of energy costs attributable to the energy saving measure over a 376
defined period of time and are to be made only to the extent 377
that such savings occur. A contract that requires any additional 378
capital investment or contribution of funds, other than funds 379
available from state or federal energy grants, or that is for an 380

Code, the valuation as of the date certain of the property of 1433
the public utility that is used and useful or, with respect to a 1434
natural gas, water-works, or sewage disposal system company, is 1435
projected to be used and useful as of the date certain, in 1436
rendering the public utility service for which rates are to be 1437
fixed and determined. The 1438
(b) With respect to an electric light company that chooses 1439
to file a forecasted test period under section 4909.18 of the 1440
Revised Code, the valuation of the property of the utility that 1441
is projected to be used and useful during the forecasted test 1442
period in rendering the public utility service for which rates 1443
are to be fixed and determined. 1444
(c) The valuation so determined under division (A)(1) of 1445
this section for any public utility shall be the total value as 1446
set forth in division (C)(9)(B)(8) of section 4909.042 of the 1447
Revised Code and division (B)(9) of section 4909.05 of the 1448

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 51
As Passed by the Senate
Revised Code, and a reasonable allowance for materials and 1449
supplies and a reasonable allowance for cash working capital as 1450
determined by the commission. 1451
The commission, in its discretion, may include in the 1452
valuation a reasonable allowance for construction work in 1453
progress but, in no event, may such an allowance be made by the 1454
commission until it has determined that the particular 1455
construction project is at least seventy-five per cent complete. 1456
In determining the percentage completion of a particular 1457
construction project, the commission shall consider, among other 1458
relevant criteria, the per cent of time elapsed in construction; 1459
the per cent of construction funds, excluding allowance for 1460
funds used during construction, expended, or obligated to such 1461
construction funds budgeted where all such funds are adjusted to 1462
reflect current purchasing power; and any physical inspection 1463
performed by or on behalf of any party, including the 1464
commission's staff. 1465
A reasonable allowance for construction work in progress 1466
shall not exceed ten per cent of the total valuation as stated 1467
in this division, not including such allowance for construction 1468
work in progress. 1469
Where the commission permits an allowance for construction 1470
work in progress, the dollar value of the project or portion 1471
thereof included in the valuation as construction work in 1472
progress shall not be included in the valuation as plant in 1473
service until such time as the total revenue effect of the 1474
construction work in progress allowance is offset by the total 1475
revenue effect of the plant in service exclusion. Carrying 1476
charges calculated in a manner similar to allowance for funds 1477
used during construction shall accrue on that portion of the 1478

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 52
As Passed by the Senate
project in service but not reflected in rates as plant in 1479
service, and such accrued carrying charges shall be included in 1480
the valuation of the property at the conclusion of the offset 1481
period for purposes of division (C)(9) of section 4909.05 of the 1482
Revised Code. 1483
From and after April 10, 1985, no allowance for 1484
construction work in progress as it relates to a particular 1485
construction project shall be reflected in rates for a period 1486
exceeding forty-eight consecutive months commencing on the date 1487
the initial rates reflecting such allowance become effective, 1488
except as otherwise provided in this division. 1489
The applicable maximum period in rates for an allowance 1490
for construction work in progress as it relates to a particular 1491
construction project shall be tolled if, and to the extent, a 1492
delay in the in-service date of the project is caused by the 1493
action or inaction of any federal, state, county, or municipal 1494
agency having jurisdiction, where such action or inaction 1495
relates to a change in a rule, standard, or approval of such 1496
agency, and where such action or inaction is not the result of 1497
the failure of the utility to reasonably endeavor to comply with 1498
any rule, standard, or approval prior to such change. 1499
In the event that such period expires before the project 1500
goes into service, the commission shall exclude, from the date 1501
of expiration, the allowance for the project as construction 1502
work in progress from rates, except that the commission may 1503
extend the expiration date up to twelve months for good cause 1504
shown. 1505
In the event that a utility has permanently canceled, 1506
abandoned, or terminated construction of a project for which it 1507
was previously permitted a construction work in progress 1508

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 53
As Passed by the Senate
allowance, the commission immediately shall exclude the 1509
allowance for the project from the valuation. 1510
In the event that a construction work in progress project 1511
previously included in the valuation is removed from the 1512
valuation pursuant to this division, any revenues collected by 1513
the utility from its customers after April 10, 1985, that 1514
resulted from such prior inclusion shall be offset against 1515
future revenues over the same period of time as the project was 1516
included in the valuation as construction work in progress. The 1517
total revenue effect of such offset shall not exceed the total 1518
revenues previously collected. 1519
In no event shall the total revenue effect of any offset 1520
or offsets provided under division (A)(1) of this section exceed 1521
the total revenue effect of any construction work in progress 1522
allowance. 1523
(2) A fair and reasonable rate of return to the utility on 1524
the valuation as determined in division (A)(1) of this section; 1525
(3) The dollar annual return to which the utility is 1526
entitled by applying the fair and reasonable rate of return as 1527
determined under division (A)(2) of this section to the 1528
valuation of the utility determined under division (A)(1) of 1529
this section; 1530
(4) The cost to the utility of rendering the public 1531
utility service for the test period used for the determination 1532
under division (C)(1) of this section, less the total of any 1533
interest on cash or credit refunds paid, pursuant to section 1534
4909.42 of the Revised Code, by the utility during the test 1535
period. 1536

by net income may, in the discretion of the commission, be 1538
computed by the normalization method of accounting, provided the 1539
utility maintains accounting reserves that reflect differences 1540
between taxes actually payable and taxes on a normalized basis, 1541
provided that no determination as to the treatment in the rate- 1542
making process of such taxes shall be made that will result in 1543
loss of any tax depreciation or other tax benefit to which the 1544
utility would otherwise be entitled, and further provided that 1545
such tax benefit as redounds to the utility as a result of such 1546
a computation may not be retained by the company, used to fund 1547
any dividend or distribution, or utilized for any purpose other 1548
than the defrayal of the operating expenses of the utility and 1549
the defrayal of the expenses of the utility in connection with 1550
construction work. 1551
(b) The amount of any tax credits granted to an electric 1552
light company under section 5727.391 of the Revised Code for 1553
Ohio coal burned prior to January 1, 2000, shall not be retained 1554
by the company, used to fund any dividend or distribution, or 1555
utilized for any purposes other than the defrayal of the 1556
allowable operating expenses of the company and the defrayal of 1557
the allowable expenses of the company in connection with the 1558
installation, acquisition, construction, or use of a compliance 1559
facility. The amount of the tax credits granted to an electric 1560
light company under that section for Ohio coal burned prior to 1561
January 1, 2000, shall be returned to its customers within three 1562
years after initially claiming the credit through an offset to 1563
the company's rates or fuel component, as determined by the 1564
commission, as set forth in schedules filed by the company under 1565
section 4905.30 of the Revised Code. As used in division (A)(4) 1566
(b) of this section, "compliance facility" has the same meaning 1567
as in section 5727.391 of the Revised Code. 1568

(B) The commission shall compute the gross annual revenues 1569
to which the utility is entitled by adding the dollar amount of 1570
return under division (A)(3) of this section to the cost, for 1571
the test period used for the determination under division (C)(1) 1572
of this section, of rendering the public utility service under 1573
division (A)(4) of this section. 1574
(C)(1) Except as provided in division (D) of this section, 1575
the revenues and expenses of the utility shall be determined 1576
during a test period. The utility may as follows: 1577
(a) Electric light companies may propose a forecasted test 1578
period. If the company proposes a forecasted test period, the 1579
company shall propose annual base rates for three consecutive 1580
twelve-month periods in a single forecasted test period 1581
application. During the first twelve-month period, the company 1582
may propose a reasonably forecasted rate base during a thirteen- 1583
month average, revenues, and expenses for the first twelve 1584
months that new base rates will be in effect. 1585
During the second twelve-month period, the base rate 1586
revenue requirement shall be adjusted for the return of, and 1587
return on, incremental rate base additions approved by the 1588
commission in the initial application. During the third twelve- 1589
month period, the base rate revenue requirement may be adjusted 1590
for the return of and return on incremental rate base additions 1591
approved by the commission in the initial application. 1592
For each twelve-month period, forecasted plant investment, 1593
forecasted revenue, and forecasted expenses versus actual 1594
investment, actual revenue, and actual expenses shall be trued 1595
up via a cost recovery mechanism approved by the commission. 1596
Each true-up process shall include an adjustment to actual 1597

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 56
As Passed by the Senate
for the rate of return that the company is authorized to earn on 1598
the actual investments made. The company shall provide the 1599
commission with actual financial information during the true-up 1600
process to ensure accuracy. As part of the true-up process, the 1601
commission shall include only rate base components that have 1602
been found by the commission to be used and useful in rendering 1603
public utility service. 1604
(b) All utilities, except for electric light companies 1605
that choose to file under division (C)(1)(a) of this section, 1606
shall propose a test period for this determination that is any 1607
twelve-month period beginning not more than six months prior to 1608
the date the application is filed and ending not more than nine 1609
months subsequent to that date. The test period for determining 1610
revenues and expenses of the utility shall be the test period 1611
proposed by the utility, unless otherwise ordered by the 1612
commission. 1613
(2) The For utilities filing under division (C)(1)(b) of 1614
this section, the date certain shall be not later than the date 1615
of filing, except that it shall be, for a natural gas, water- 1616
works, or sewage disposal system company, not later than the end 1617
of the test period. 1618
(D) A natural gas, water-works, or sewage disposal system 1619
company Utilities filing under division (C)(1)(b) of this 1620
section may propose adjustments to the revenues and expenses to 1621
be determined under division (C)(1) of this section for any 1622
changes that are, during the test period or the twelve-month 1623
period immediately following the test period, reasonably 1624
expected to occur. The natural gas, water-works, or sewage 1625
disposal system company utility shall identify and quantify, 1626
individually, any proposed adjustments. The commission shall 1627

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 57
As Passed by the Senate
incorporate the proposed adjustments into the determination if 1628
the adjustments are just and reasonable. 1629
(E) When the commission is of the opinion, after hearing 1630
and after making the determinations under divisions (A) and (B) 1631
of this section, that any rate, fare, charge, toll, rental, 1632

(3) A published source of information is available 2945
publicly or through subscription that identifies pricing 2946
information for traded electricity on- and off-peak energy 2947
products that are contracts for delivery beginning at least two 2948
years from the date of the publication and is updated on a 2949
regular basis. 2950

As Passed by the Senate
The commission shall initiate a proceeding and, within 2951
ninety days after the application's filing date, shall determine 2952
by order whether the electric distribution utility and its 2953
market-rate offer meet all of the foregoing requirements. If the 2954
finding is positive, the electric distribution utility may shall 2955
initiate its competitive bidding process. If the finding is 2956
negative as to one or more requirements, the commission in the 2957
order shall direct the electric distribution utility regarding 2958
how any deficiency may shall be timely remedied in a timely 2959
manner to the commission's satisfaction; otherwise, the electric 2960
distribution utility shall withdraw the application. However, if 2961
such remedy is made and the subsequent finding is positive and 2962
also if the electric distribution utility made a simultaneous 2963
filing under this section and section 4928.143 of the Revised 2964
Code, the utility shall not initiate its competitive bid until 2965
at least one hundred fifty days after the filing date of those 2966
applications. 2967
(C) Upon the completion of the competitive bidding process 2968
authorized by divisions (A) and (B) of this section, including 2969
for the purpose of division (D) of this section, the commission 2970
shall select the least-cost bid winner or winners of that 2971
process, and such selected bid or bids, as prescribed as retail 2972
rates by the commission, shall be the electric distribution 2973
utility's standard service offer unless the commission, by order 2974
issued before the third calendar day following the conclusion of 2975
the competitive bidding process for the market rate offer, 2976
determines that one or more of the following criteria were not 2977
met: 2978
(1) Each portion of the bidding process was 2979
oversubscribed, such that the amount of supply bid upon was 2980
greater than the amount of the load bid out. 2981

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 103
As Passed by the Senate
(2) There were four or more bidders. 2982
(3) At least twenty-five per cent of the load is bid upon 2983
by one or more persons other than the electric distribution 2984
utility. 2985
All costs incurred by the electric distribution utility as 2986
a result of or related to the competitive bidding process or to 2987
procuring generation service to provide the standard service 2988
offer, including the costs of energy and capacity and the costs 2989
of all other products and services procured as a result of the 2990
competitive bidding process, shall be timely recovered through 2991
the standard service offer price, and, for that purpose, the 2992
commission shall approve a reconciliation mechanism, other 2993
recovery mechanism, or a combination of such mechanisms for the 2994
utility. 2995
(D) The first application filed under this section by an 2996
electric distribution utility that, as of July 31, 2008, 2997
directly owns, in whole or in part, operating electric 2998
generating facilities that had been used and useful in this 2999
state shall require that a portion of that the utility's 3000
standard service offer load for the first five years of the 3001
market rate offer be competitively bid under division (A) of 3002
this section as follows: ten per cent of the load in year one, 3003
not more than twenty per cent in year two, thirty per cent in 3004
year three, forty per cent in year four, and fifty per cent in 3005
year five. Consistent with those percentages, the commission 3006
shall determine the actual percentages for each year of years 3007
one through five. The standard service offer price for retail 3008
electric generation service under this first application shall 3009
be a proportionate blend of the bid price and the generation 3010
service price for the remaining standard service offer load, 3011

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 104
As Passed by the Senate
which latter price shall be equal to the electric distribution 3012
utility's most recent standard service offer price, adjusted 3013
upward or downward as the commission determines reasonable, 3014
relative to the jurisdictional portion of any known and 3015
measurable changes from the level of any one or more of the 3016
following costs as reflected in that most recent standard 3017
service offer price: 3018
(1) The electric distribution utility's prudently incurred 3019
cost of fuel used to produce electricity; 3020
(2) Its prudently incurred purchased power costs; 3021
(3) Its prudently incurred costs of satisfying the supply 3022
and demand portfolio requirements of this state, including, but 3023
not limited to, renewable energy resource and energy efficiency 3024
requirements; 3025
(4) Its costs prudently incurred to comply with 3026
environmental laws and regulations, with consideration of the 3027
derating of any facility associated with those costs. 3028
In making any adjustment to the most recent standard 3029
service offer price on the basis of costs described in division 3030
(D) of this section, the commission shall include the benefits 3031
that may become available to the electric distribution utility 3032
as a result of or in connection with the costs included in the 3033
adjustment, including, but not limited to, the utility's receipt 3034
of emissions credits or its receipt of tax benefits or of other 3035
benefits, and, accordingly, the commission may impose such 3036
conditions on the adjustment to ensure that any such benefits 3037
are properly aligned with the associated cost responsibility. 3038
The commission shall also determine how such adjustments will 3039
affect the electric distribution utility's return on common 3040

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 105
As Passed by the Senate
equity that may be achieved by those adjustments. The commission 3041
shall not apply its consideration of the return on common equity 3042
to reduce any adjustments authorized under this division unless 3043
the adjustments will cause the electric distribution utility to 3044
earn a return on common equity that is significantly in excess 3045
of the return on common equity that is earned by publicly traded 3046
companies, including utilities, that face comparable business 3047
and financial risk, with such adjustments for capital structure 3048
as may be appropriate. The burden of proof for demonstrating 3049
that significantly excessive earnings will not occur shall be on 3050
the electric distribution utility. 3051
Additionally, the commission may adjust the electric 3052
distribution utility's most recent standard service offer price 3053
by such just and reasonable amount that the commission 3054
determines necessary to address any emergency that threatens the 3055
utility's financial integrity or to ensure that the resulting 3056
revenue available to the utility for providing the standard 3057
service offer is not so inadequate as to result, directly or 3058
indirectly, in a taking of property without compensation 3059
pursuant to Section 19 of Article I, Ohio Constitution. The 3060
electric distribution utility has the burden of demonstrating 3061
that any adjustment to its most recent standard service offer 3062
price is proper in accordance with this division. 3063
(E) Beginning in the second year of a blended price under 3064
division (D) of this section and notwithstanding any other 3065
requirement of this section, the commission may alter 3066
prospectively the proportions specified in that division to 3067
mitigate any effect of an abrupt or significant change in the 3068
electric distribution utility's standard service offer price 3069
that would otherwise result in general or with respect to any 3070
rate group or rate schedule but for such alteration. Any such 3071

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 106
As Passed by the Senate
alteration shall be made not more often than annually, and the 3072
commission shall not, by altering those proportions and in any 3073
event, including because of the length of time, as authorized 3074
under division (C) of this section, taken to approve the market 3075
rate offer, cause the duration of the blending period to exceed 3076
ten years as counted from the effective date of the approved 3077
market rate offer. Additionally, any such alteration shall be 3078
limited to an alteration affecting the prospective proportions 3079
used during the blending period and shall not affect any 3080
blending proportion previously approved and applied by the 3081
commission under this division. 3082
(F) An electric distribution utility that has received 3083
commission approval of its first application under division (C) 3084
of this section shall not, nor ever shall be authorized or 3085
required by the commission to, file an application under section 3086
4928.143 of the Revised Code. 3087
Sec. 4928.144. The public utilities commission by order 3088
may authorize any just and reasonable phase-in of any electric 3089
distribution utility rate or price established under sections 3090
4928.141 to 4928.143 and 4928.142 of the Revised Code, and 3091
inclusive of carrying charges, as the commission considers 3092
necessary to ensure rate or price stability for consumers. If 3093
the commission's order includes such a phase-in, the order also 3094
shall provide for the creation of regulatory assets pursuant to 3095
generally accepted accounting principles, by authorizing the 3096
deferral of incurred costs equal to the amount not collected, 3097
plus carrying charges on that amount. Further, the order shall 3098
authorize the collection of those deferrals through a 3099
nonbypassable surcharge on any such rate or price so established 3100
for the electric distribution utility by the commission. 3101

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 107
As Passed by the Senate
Sec. 4928.149. No electric distribution utility may use 3102
any electric energy storage system to participate in the 3103
wholesale market, if the utility purchased or acquired that 3104
system for distribution service. 3105
Sec. 4928.1410. If an electric distribution utility has a n 3106
existing electric security plan under which the commission had 3107
authorized the creation or continuation of riders, then, to the 3108
extent those riders will cease to exist after termination of the 3109
electric security plan, the electric distribution utility is 3110
authorized to create necessary regulatory assets or liabilities, 3111
along with carrying costs at the utility's weighted average cost 3112
of debt, for the resolution of any outstanding under-collection 3113
or over-collection of funds under such riders. The resolution of 3114
such regulatory assets or liabilities shall be addressed in the 3115
first distribution rate case under section 4909.18 of the 3116
Revised Code that occurs after the plan's expiration. 3117
Sec. 4928.17. (A) Except as otherwise provided in sections 3118
4928.141 or 4928.142 or 4928.143 or 4928.31 to 4928.40 of the 3119
Revised Code and beginning on the starting date of competitive 3120
retail electric service, no electric utility shall engage in 3121
this state, either directly or through an affiliate, in the 3122
businesses of supplying a noncompetitive retail electric service 3123
and supplying a competitive retail electric service, or in the 3124
businesses of supplying a noncompetitive retail electric service 3125
and supplying a product or service other than retail electric 3126
service, unless the utility implements and operates under a 3127
corporate separation plan that is approved by the public 3128
utilities commission under this section, is consistent with the 3129
policy specified in section 4928.02 of the Revised Code, and 3130
achieves all of the following: 3131

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 108
As Passed by the Senate
(1) The plan provides, at minimum, for the provision of 3132
the competitive retail electric service or the nonelectric 3133
product or service through a fully separated affiliate of the 3134
utility, and the plan includes separate accounting requirements, 3135
the code of conduct as ordered by the commission pursuant to a 3136
rule it shall adopt under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the 3137
Revised Code, and such other measures as are necessary to 3138
effectuate the policy specified in section 4928.02 of the 3139
Revised Code. 3140
(2) The plan satisfies the public interest in preventing 3141
unfair competitive advantage and preventing the abuse of market 3142
power. 3143
(3) The plan is sufficient to ensure that the utility will 3144
not extend any undue preference or advantage to any affiliate, 3145
division, or part of its own business engaged in the business of 3146
supplying the competitive retail electric service or nonelectric 3147
product or service, including, but not limited to, utility 3148
resources such as trucks, tools, office equipment, office space, 3149
supplies, customer and marketing information, advertising, 3150
billing and mailing systems, personnel, and training, without 3151
compensation based upon fully loaded embedded costs charged to 3152
the affiliate; and to ensure that any such affiliate, division, 3153
or part will not receive undue preference or advantage from any 3154
affiliate, division, or part of the business engaged in business 3155
of supplying the noncompetitive retail electric service. No such 3156
utility, affiliate, division, or part shall extend such undue 3157
preference. Notwithstanding any other division of this section, 3158
a utility's obligation under division (A)(3) of this section 3159
shall be effective January 1, 2000. 3160
(B) The commission may approve, modify and approve, or 3161

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 109
As Passed by the Senate
disapprove a corporate separation plan filed with the commission 3162
under division (A) of this section. As part of the code of 3163
conduct required under division (A)(1) of this section, the 3164
commission shall adopt rules pursuant to division (A) of section 3165
4928.06 of the Revised Code regarding corporate separation and 3166
procedures for plan filing and approval. The rules shall include 3167
limitations on affiliate practices solely for the purpose of 3168
maintaining a separation of the affiliate's business from the 3169
business of the utility to prevent unfair competitive advantage 3170
abuse of market power by virtue of that relationship. The rules 3171
also shall include an opportunity for any person having a real 3172
and substantial interest in the corporate separation plan to 3173
file specific objections to the plan and propose specific 3174
responses to issues raised in the objections, which objections 3175
and responses the commission shall address in its final order. 3176
Prior to commission approval of the plan, the commission shall 3177
afford a hearing upon those aspects of the plan that the 3178
commission determines reasonably require a hearing. The 3179
commission may reject and require refiling of a substantially 3180
inadequate plan under this section. 3181
(C) The commission shall issue an order approving or 3182
modifying and approving a corporate separation plan under this 3183
section, to be effective on the date specified in the order, 3184
only upon findings that the plan reasonably complies with the 3185
requirements of division (A) of this section and will provide 3186
for ongoing compliance with the policy specified in section 3187
4928.02 of the Revised Code. However, for good cause shown, the 3188
commission may issue an order approving or modifying and 3189
approving a corporate separation plan under this section that 3190
does not comply with division (A)(1) of this section but 3191
complies with such functional separation requirements as the 3192

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 110
As Passed by the Senate
commission authorizes to apply for an interim period prescribed 3193
in the order, upon a finding that such alternative plan will 3194
provide for ongoing compliance with the policy specified in 3195
section 4928.02 of the Revised Code. 3196
(D) Any party may seek an amendment to a corporate 3197
separation plan approved under this section, and the commission, 3198
pursuant to a request from any party or on its own initiative, 3199
may order as it considers necessary the filing of an amended 3200
corporate separation plan to reflect changed circumstances. 3201
(E) No electric distribution utility shall sell or 3202
transfer any generating asset it wholly or partly owns at any 3203
time without obtaining prior commission approval. 3204
Sec. 4928.20. (A) The legislative authority of a municipal 3205
corporation may adopt an ordinance, or the board of township 3206
trustees of a township or the board of county commissioners of a 3207
county may adopt a resolution, under which, on or after the 3208
starting date of competitive retail electric service, it may 3209
aggregate in accordance with this section the retail electrical 3210
loads located, respectively, within the municipal corporation, 3211
township, or unincorporated area of the county and, for that 3212
purpose, may enter into service agreements to facilitate for 3213
those loads the sale and purchase of electricity. The 3214
legislative authority or board also may exercise such authority 3215
jointly with any other such legislative authority or board. For 3216
customers that are not mercantile customers, an ordinance or 3217
resolution under this division shall specify whether the 3218
aggregation will occur only with the prior, affirmative consent 3219
of each person owning, occupying, controlling, or using an 3220
electric load center proposed to be aggregated or will occur 3221
automatically for all such persons pursuant to the opt-out 3222

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 111
As Passed by the Senate
requirements of division (D) of this section. The aggregation of 3223
mercantile customers shall occur only with the prior, 3224
affirmative consent of each such person owning, occupying, 3225
controlling, or using an electric load center proposed to be 3226
aggregated. Nothing in this division, however, authorizes the 3227
aggregation of the retail electric loads of an electric load 3228
center, as defined in section 4933.81 of the Revised Code, that 3229
is located in the certified territory of a nonprofit electric 3230
supplier under sections 4933.81 to 4933.90 of the Revised Code 3231
or an electric load center served by transmission or 3232
distribution facilities of a municipal electric utility. 3233
(B) If an ordinance or resolution adopted under division 3234
(A) of this section specifies that aggregation of customers that 3235
are not mercantile customers will occur automatically as 3236
described in that division, the ordinance or resolution shall 3237
direct the board of elections to submit the question of the 3238
authority to aggregate to the electors of the respective 3239
municipal corporation, township, or unincorporated area of a 3240
county at a special election on the day of the next primary or 3241
general election in the municipal corporation, township, or 3242
county. The legislative authority or board shall certify a copy 3243
of the ordinance or resolution to the board of elections not 3244
less than ninety days before the day of the special election. No 3245
ordinance or resolution adopted under division (A) of this 3246
section that provides for an election under this division shall 3247
take effect unless approved by a majority of the electors voting 3248
upon the ordinance or resolution at the election held pursuant 3249
to this division. 3250
(C) Upon the applicable requisite authority under 3251
divisions (A) and (B) of this section, the legislative authority 3252
or board shall develop a plan of operation and governance for 3253

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 112
As Passed by the Senate
the aggregation program so authorized. Before adopting a plan 3254
under this division, the legislative authority or board shall 3255
hold at least two public hearings on the plan. Before the first 3256
hearing, the legislative authority or board shall publish notice 3257
of the hearings once a week for two consecutive weeks in a 3258
newspaper of general circulation in the jurisdiction or as 3259
provided in section 7.16 of the Revised Code. The notice shall 3260
summarize the plan and state the date, time, and location of 3261
each hearing. 3262
(D) No legislative authority or board, pursuant to an 3263
ordinance or resolution under divisions (A) and (B) of this 3264
section that provides for automatic aggregation of customers 3265
that are not mercantile customers as described in division (A) 3266
of this section, shall aggregate the electrical load of any 3267
electric load center located within its jurisdiction unless it 3268
in advance clearly discloses to the person owning, occupying, 3269
controlling, or using the load center that the person will be 3270
enrolled automatically in the aggregation program and will 3271
remain so enrolled unless the person affirmatively elects by a 3272
stated procedure not to be so enrolled. The disclosure shall 3273
state prominently the rates, charges, and other terms and 3274
conditions of enrollment. The stated procedure shall allow any 3275
person enrolled in the aggregation program the opportunity to 3276
opt out of the program every three years, without paying a 3277
switching fee. Any such person that opts out before the 3278
commencement of the aggregation program pursuant to the stated 3279
procedure shall default to the standard service offer provided 3280
under section 4928.14 or division (D) of section 4928.35 of the 3281
Revised Code until the person chooses an alternative supplier. 3282
(E)(1) With respect to a governmental aggregation for a 3283
municipal corporation that is authorized pursuant to divisions 3284

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 113
As Passed by the Senate
(A) to (D) of this section, resolutions may be proposed by 3285
initiative or referendum petitions in accordance with sections 3286
731.28 to 731.41 of the Revised Code. 3287
(2) With respect to a governmental aggregation for a 3288
township or the unincorporated area of a county, which 3289
aggregation is authorized pursuant to divisions (A) to (D) of 3290
this section, resolutions may be proposed by initiative or 3291
referendum petitions in accordance with sections 731.28 to 3292
731.40 of the Revised Code, except that: 3293
(a) The petitions shall be filed, respectively, with the 3294
township fiscal officer or the board of county commissioners, 3295
who shall perform those duties imposed under those sections upon 3296
the city auditor or village clerk. 3297
(b) The petitions shall contain the signatures of not less 3298
than ten per cent of the total number of electors in, 3299
respectively, the township or the unincorporated area of the 3300
county who voted for the office of governor at the preceding 3301
general election for that office in that area. 3302
(F) A governmental aggregator under division (A) of this 3303
section is not a public utility engaging in the wholesale 3304
purchase and resale of electricity, and provision of the 3305
aggregated service is not a wholesale utility transaction. A 3306
governmental aggregator shall be subject to supervision and 3307
regulation by the public utilities commission only to the extent 3308
of any competitive retail electric service it provides and 3309
commission authority under this chapter. 3310
(G) This section does not apply in the case of a municipal 3311
corporation that supplies such aggregated service to electric 3312
load centers to which its municipal electric utility also 3313

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 114
As Passed by the Senate
supplies a noncompetitive retail electric service through 3314
transmission or distribution facilities the utility singly or 3315
jointly owns or operates. 3316
(H) A governmental aggregator shall not include in its 3317
aggregation the accounts of any of the following: 3318
(1) A customer that has opted out of the aggregation; 3319
(2) A customer in contract with a certified electric 3320
services company; 3321
(3) A customer that has a special contract with an 3322
electric distribution utility; 3323
(4) A customer that is not located within the governmental 3324
aggregator's governmental boundaries; 3325
(5) Subject to division (C) of section 4928.21 of the 3326
Revised Code, a customer who appears on the "do not aggregate" 3327
list maintained under that section. 3328
(I) Customers that are part of a governmental aggregation 3329
under this section shall be responsible only for such portion of 3330
a surcharge under section 4928.144 of the Revised Code that is 3331
proportionate to the benefits, as determined by the commission, 3332
that electric load centers within the jurisdiction of the 3333
governmental aggregation as a group receive. The proportionate 3334
surcharge so established shall apply to each customer of the 3335
governmental aggregation while the customer is part of that 3336
aggregation. If a customer ceases being such a customer, the 3337
otherwise applicable surcharge shall apply. Nothing in this 3338
section shall result in less than full recovery by an electric 3339
distribution utility of any surcharge authorized under section 3340
4928.144 of the Revised Code. Nothing in this section shall 3341
result in less than the full and timely imposition, charging, 3342

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 115
As Passed by the Senate
collection, and adjustment by an electric distribution utility, 3343
its assignee, or any collection agent, of the phase-in-recovery 3344
charges authorized pursuant to a final financing order issued 3345
pursuant to sections 4928.23 to 4928.2318 of the Revised Code. 3346
(J) On behalf of the customers that are part of a 3347
governmental aggregation under this section and by filing 3348
written notice with the public utilities commission, the 3349
legislative authority that formed or is forming that 3350
governmental aggregation may elect not to receive standby 3351
service within the meaning of division (B)(2)(d) of section 3352
4928.143 of the Revised Code from an electric distribution 3353
utility in whose certified territory the governmental 3354
aggregation is located and that operates under an approved 3355
electric security plan under that section. Upon the filing of 3356
that notice, the electric distribution utility shall not charge 3357
any such customer to whom competitive retail electric generation 3358
service is provided by another supplier under the governmental 3359
aggregation for the standby service. Any such consumer that 3360
returns to the utility for competitive retail electric service 3361
shall pay the market price of power incurred by the utility to 3362
serve that consumer plus any amount attributable to the 3363
utility's cost of compliance with the renewable energy resource 3364
provisions of section 4928.64 of the Revised Code to serve the 3365
consumer. Such market price shall include, but not be limited 3366
to, capacity and energy charges; all charges associated with the 3367
provision of that power supply through the regional transmission 3368
organization, including, but not limited to, transmission, 3369
ancillary services, congestion, and settlement and 3370
administrative charges; and all other costs incurred by the 3371
utility that are associated with the procurement, provision, and 3372
administration of that power supply, as such costs may be 3373

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 116
As Passed by the Senate
approved by the commission. The period of time during which the 3374

commission action. 3695
Sec. 4928.34. (A) The public utilities commission shall 3696
not approve or prescribe a transition plan under division (A) or 3697
(B) of section 4928.33 of the Revised Code unless the commission 3698
first makes all of the following determinations: 3699
(1) The unbundled components for the electric transmission 3700
component of retail electric service, as specified in the 3701
utility's rate unbundling plan required by division (A)(1) of 3702
section 4928.31 of the Revised Code, equal the tariff rates 3703
determined by the federal energy regulatory commission that are 3704
in effect on the date of the approval of the transition plan 3705
under sections 4928.31 to 4928.40 of the Revised Code, as each 3706
such rate is determined applicable to each particular customer 3707
class and rate schedule by the commission. The unbundled 3708
transmission component shall include a sliding scale of charges 3709
under division (B) of section 4905.31 of the Revised Code to 3710
ensure that refunds determined or approved by the federal energy 3711
regulatory commission are flowed through to retail electric 3712
customers. 3713
(2) The unbundled components for retail electric 3714
distribution service in the rate unbundling plan equal the 3715
difference between the costs attributable to the utility's 3716
transmission and distribution rates and charges under its 3717
schedule of rates and charges in effect on the effective date of 3718
this section, based upon the record in the most recent rate 3719
proceeding of the utility for which the utility's schedule was 3720
established, and the tariff rates for electric transmission 3721
service determined by the federal energy regulatory commission 3722
as described in division (A)(1) of this section. 3723
(3) All other unbundled components required by the 3724

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 128
As Passed by the Senate
commission in the rate unbundling plan equal the costs 3725
attributable to the particular service as reflected in the 3726
utility's schedule of rates and charges in effect on the 3727
effective date of this section. 3728
(4) The unbundled components for retail electric 3729
generation service in the rate unbundling plan equal the 3730
residual amount remaining after the determination of the 3731
transmission, distribution, and other unbundled components, and 3732
after any adjustments necessary to reflect the effects of the 3733
amendment of section 5727.111 of the Revised Code by Sub. S.B. 3734
No. 3 of the 123rd general assembly. 3735
(5) All unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan 3736
have been adjusted to reflect any base rate reductions on file 3737
with the commission and as scheduled to be in effect by December 3738
31, 2005, under rate settlements in effect on the effective date 3739
of this section. However, all earnings obligations, 3740
restrictions, or caps imposed on an electric utility in a 3741
commission order prior to the effective date of this section are 3742
void. 3743
(6) Subject to division (A)(5) of this section, the total 3744
of all unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan are 3745
capped and shall equal during the market development period, 3746
except as specifically provided in this chapter, the total of 3747
all rates and charges in effect under the applicable bundled 3748
schedule of the electric utility pursuant to section 4905.30 of 3749
the Revised Code in effect on the day before the effective date 3750
of this section, including the transition charge determined 3751
under section 4928.40 of the Revised Code, adjusted for any 3752
changes in the taxation of electric utilities and retail 3753
electric service under Sub. S.B. No. 3 of the 123rd General 3754

As Passed by the Senate
Assembly, the universal service rider authorized by section 3755
4928.51 of the Revised Code, and the temporary rider authorized 3756
by section 4928.61 of the Revised Code. For the purpose of this 3757
division, the rate cap applicable to a customer receiving 3758
electric service pursuant to an arrangement approved by the 3759
commission under section 4905.31 of the Revised Code is, for the 3760
term of the arrangement, the total of all rates and charges in 3761
effect under the arrangement. For any rate schedule filed 3762
pursuant to section 4905.30 of the Revised Code or any 3763
arrangement subject to approval pursuant to section 4905.31 of 3764
the Revised Code, the initial tax-related adjustment to the rate 3765
cap required by this division shall be equal to the rate of 3766
taxation specified in section 5727.81 of the Revised Code and 3767
applicable to the schedule or arrangement. To the extent such 3768
total annual amount of the tax-related adjustment is greater 3769
than or less than the comparable amount of the total annual tax 3770
reduction experienced by the electric utility as a result of the 3771
provisions of Sub. S.B. No. 3 of the 123rd general assembly, 3772
such difference shall be addressed by the commission through 3773
accounting procedures, refunds, or an annual surcharge or credit 3774
to customers, or through other appropriate means, to avoid 3775
placing the financial responsibility for the difference upon the 3776
electric utility or its shareholders. Any adjustments in the 3777
rate of taxation specified in section 5727.81 of the Revised 3778

As Passed by the Senate
contract, a portion of the electricity supply required for its 3902
standard service offer under section sections 4928.141 and 3903
4928.142 of the Revised Code, and an electric services company 3904
shall have provided a portion of its electricity supply for 3905
retail consumers in this state from qualifying renewable energy 3906
resources, including, at its discretion, qualifying renewable 3907
energy resources obtained pursuant to an electricity supply 3908
contract. That portion shall equal eight and one-half per cent 3909
of the total number of kilowatt hours of electricity sold by the 3910
subject utility or company to any and all retail electric 3911
consumers whose electric load centers are served by that utility 3912
and are located within the utility's certified territory or, in 3913
the case of an electric services company, are served by the 3914
company and are located within this state. However, nothing in 3915
this section precludes a utility or company from providing a 3916
greater percentage. 3917
(2) Subject to section 4928.642 of the Revised Code, the 3918
The portion required under division (B)(1) of this section shall 3919
be generated from renewable energy resources in accordance with 3920
the following benchmarks: 3921

by the utility or company shall be met either: 3924
(a) Through facilities located in this state; or 3925
(b) With resources that can be shown to be deliverable 3926
into this state. 3927
(C)(1) The commission annually shall review an electric 3928

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 136
As Passed by the Senate
distribution utility's or electric services company's compliance 3929
with the most recent applicable benchmark under division (B)(2) 3930
of this section and, in the course of that review, shall 3931
identify any undercompliance or noncompliance of the utility or 3932
company that it determines is weather-related, related to 3933
equipment or resource shortages for qualifying renewable energy 3934
resources as applicable, or is otherwise outside the utility's 3935
or company's control. 3936
(2) Subject to the cost cap provisions of division (C)(3) 3937
of this section, if the commission determines, after notice and 3938
opportunity for hearing, and based upon its findings in that 3939
review regarding avoidable undercompliance or noncompliance, but 3940
subject to division (C)(4) of this section, that the utility or 3941
company has failed to comply with any such benchmark, the 3942
commission shall impose a renewable energy compliance payment on 3943
the utility or company. 3944
(a) The compliance payment pertaining to the solar energy 3945
resource benchmarks under division (B)(2) of this section shall 3946
be an amount per megawatt hour of undercompliance or 3947
noncompliance in the period under review, as follows: 3948
(i) Three hundred dollars for 2014, 2015, and 2016; 3949
(ii) Two hundred fifty dollars for 2017 and 2018; 3950
(iii) Two hundred dollars for 2019. 3951
(b) The compliance payment pertaining to the renewable 3952
energy resource benchmarks under division (B)(2) of this section 3953
shall equal the number of additional renewable energy credits 3954
that the electric distribution utility or electric services 3955
company would have needed to comply with the applicable 3956
benchmark in the period under review times an amount that shall 3957

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 137
As Passed by the Senate
begin at forty-five dollars and shall be adjusted annually by 3958
the commission to reflect any change in the consumer price index 3959
as defined in section 101.27 of the Revised Code, but shall not 3960
be less than forty-five dollars. As used in this division, 3961
"consumer price index" means the consumer price index prepared 3962
by the United States bureau of labor statistics (U.S. city 3963
average for urban wage earners and clerical workers: all items, 3964
1982-1984=100), or, if that index is no longer published, a 3965
generally available comparable index. 3966
(c) The compliance payment shall not be passed through by 3967
the electric distribution utility or electric services company 3968
to consumers. The compliance payment shall be remitted to the 3969
commission, for deposit to the credit of the advanced energy 3970
fund created under section 4928.61 of the Revised Code. Payment 3971
of the compliance payment shall be subject to such collection 3972
and enforcement procedures as apply to the collection of a 3973
forfeiture under sections 4905.55 to 4905.60 and 4905.64 of the 3974
Revised Code. 3975
(3) An electric distribution utility or an electric 3976
services company need not comply with a benchmark under division 3977
(B)(2) of this section to the extent that its reasonably 3978
expected cost of that compliance exceeds its reasonably expected 3979
cost of otherwise producing or acquiring the requisite 3980
electricity by three per cent or more. The cost of compliance 3981
shall be calculated as though any exemption from taxes and 3982
assessments had not been granted under section 5727.75 of the 3983
Revised Code. 3984
(4)(a) An electric distribution utility or electric 3985
services company may request the commission to make a force 3986
majeure determination pursuant to this division regarding all or 3987

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 138
As Passed by the Senate
part of the utility's or company's compliance with any minimum 3988
benchmark under division (B)(2) of this section during the 3989
period of review occurring pursuant to division (C)(2) of this 3990
section. The commission may require the electric distribution 3991
utility or electric services company to make solicitations for 3992
renewable energy resource credits as part of its default service 3993
before the utility's or company's request of force majeure under 3994
this division can be made. 3995
(b) Within ninety days after the filing of a request by an 3996
electric distribution utility or electric services company under 3997
division (C)(4)(a) of this section, the commission shall 3998
determine if qualifying renewable energy resources are 3999
reasonably available in the marketplace in sufficient quantities 4000
for the utility or company to comply with the subject minimum 4001
benchmark during the review period. In making this 4002
determination, the commission shall consider whether the 4003
electric distribution utility or electric services company has 4004
made a good faith effort to acquire sufficient qualifying 4005
renewable energy or, as applicable, solar energy resources to so 4006
comply, including, but not limited to, by banking or seeking 4007
renewable energy resource credits or by seeking the resources 4008
through long-term contracts. Additionally, the commission shall 4009
consider the availability of qualifying renewable energy or 4010
solar energy resources in this state and other jurisdictions in 4011
the PJM interconnection regional transmission organization, 4012
L.L.C., or its successor and the midcontinent independent system 4013
operator or its successor. 4014
(c) If, pursuant to division (C)(4)(b) of this section, 4015
the commission determines that qualifying renewable energy or 4016
solar energy resources are not reasonably available to permit 4017
the electric distribution utility or electric services company 4018

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 139
As Passed by the Senate
to comply, during the period of review, with the subject minimum 4019
benchmark prescribed under division (B)(2) of this section, the 4020
commission shall modify that compliance obligation of the 4021
utility or company as it determines appropriate to accommodate 4022
the finding. Commission modification shall not automatically 4023
reduce the obligation for the electric distribution utility's or 4024
electric services company's compliance in subsequent years. If 4025
it modifies the electric distribution utility or electric 4026
services company obligation under division (C)(4)(c) of this 4027
section, the commission may require the utility or company, if 4028
sufficient renewable energy resource credits exist in the 4029
marketplace, to acquire additional renewable energy resource 4030
credits in subsequent years equivalent to the utility's or 4031
company's modified obligation under division (C)(4)(c) of this 4032
section. 4033
(5) The commission shall establish a process to provide 4034
for at least an annual review of the renewable energy resource 4035
market in this state and in the service territories of the 4036
regional transmission organizations that manage transmission 4037
systems located in this state. The commission shall use the 4038
results of this study to identify any needed changes to the 4039
amount of the renewable energy compliance payment specified 4040
under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of this section. Specifically, 4041
the commission may increase the amount to ensure that payment of 4042
compliance payments is not used to achieve compliance with this 4043
section in lieu of actually acquiring or realizing energy 4044
derived from qualifying renewable energy resources. However, if 4045
the commission finds that the amount of the compliance payment 4046
should be otherwise changed, the commission shall present this 4047
finding to the general assembly for legislative enactment. 4048
(D) The commission annually shall submit to the general 4049

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 140
As Passed by the Senate
assembly in accordance with section 101.68 of the Revised Code a 4050
report describing all of the following: 4051
(1) The compliance of electric distribution utilities and 4052
electric services companies with division (B) of this section; 4053
(2) The average annual cost of renewable energy credits 4054
purchased by utilities and companies for the year covered in the 4055
report; 4056
(3) Any strategy for utility and company compliance or for 4057
encouraging the use of qualifying renewable energy resources in 4058
supplying this state's electricity needs in a manner that 4059
considers available technology, costs, job creation, and 4060
economic impacts. 4061
The commission shall begin providing the information 4062
described in division (D)(2) of this section in each report 4063
submitted after September 10, 2012. The commission shall allow 4064
and consider public comments on the report prior to its 4065
submission to the general assembly. Nothing in the report shall 4066
be binding on any person, including any utility or company for 4067
the purpose of its compliance with any benchmark under division 4068
(B) of this section, or the enforcement of that provision under 4069
division (C) of this section. 4070
(E) All costs incurred by an electric distribution utility 4071
in complying with the requirements of this section shall be 4072
bypassable by any consumer that has exercised choice of supplier 4073
under section 4928.03 of the Revised Code. 4074
Sec. 4928.645. (A) An electric distribution utility or 4075
electric services company may use, for the purpose of complying 4076
with the requirements under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of section 4077
4928.64 of the Revised Code, renewable energy credits any time 4078

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 141
As Passed by the Senate
in the five calendar years following the date of their purchase 4079
or acquisition from any entity, including, but not limited to, 4080
the following: 4081
(1) A mercantile customer; 4082
(2) An owner or operator of a hydroelectric generating 4083
facility that is located at a dam on a river, or on any water 4084
discharged to a river, that is within or bordering this state or 4085
within or bordering an adjoining state, or that produces power 4086
that can be shown to be deliverable into this state; 4087
(3) A seller of compressed natural gas that has been 4088
produced from biologically derived methane gas, provided that 4089
the seller may only provide renewable energy credits for metered 4090
amounts of gas. 4091
(B)(1) The public utilities commission shall adopt rules 4092
specifying that one unit of credit shall equal one megawatt hour 4093
of electricity derived from renewable energy resources, except 4094
that, for a generating facility of seventy-five megawatts or 4095
greater that is situated within this state and has committed by 4096
December 31, 2009, to modify or retrofit its generating unit or 4097
units to enable the facility to generate principally from 4098
biomass energy by June 30, 2013, each megawatt hour of 4099
electricity generated principally from that biomass energy shall 4100
equal, in units of credit, the product obtained by multiplying 4101
the actual percentage of biomass feedstock heat input used to 4102
generate such megawatt hour by the quotient obtained by dividing 4103
the then existing unit dollar amount used to determine a 4104
renewable energy compliance payment as provided under division 4105
(C)(2)(b) of section 4928.64 of the Revised Code by the then 4106
existing market value of one renewable energy credit, but such 4107
megawatt hour shall not equal less than one unit of credit. 4108

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 142
As Passed by the Senate
Renewable energy resources do not have to be converted to 4109
electricity in order to be eligible to receive renewable energy 4110
credits. The rules shall specify that, for purposes of 4111
converting the quantity of energy derived from biologically 4112
derived methane gas to an electricity equivalent, one megawatt 4113
hour equals 3,412,142 British thermal units. 4114
(2) The rules also shall provide for this state a system 4115
of registering renewable energy credits by specifying which of 4116
any generally available registries shall be used for that 4117
purpose and not by creating a registry. That selected system of 4118
registering renewable energy credits shall allow a hydroelectric 4119
generating facility to be eligible for obtaining renewable 4120
energy credits and shall allow customer-sited projects or 4121
actions the broadest opportunities to be eligible for obtaining 4122
renewable energy credits. 4123
(C) Beginning January 1, 2020, a qualifying solar resource 4124
as defined in section 3706.40 of the Revised Code is not 4125
eligible to obtain a renewable energy credit under this section 4126
for any megawatt hour for which the resource has been issued a 4127
solar energy credit under section 3706.45 of the Revised Code. 4128
(D) Except for compressed natural gas that has been 4129
produced from biologically derived methane gas, energy generated 4130
by using natural gas as a resource is not eligible to obtain a 4131
renewable energy credit under this section. 4132
Sec. 4928.73. (A) As used in this section : 4133
(1) "Mercantile customer member" means a mercantile 4134
customer connected to a mercantile customer self-power system. 4135

facilities, or both, along with any associated facilities, that 4138
meet all of the following: 4139
(a) Produce electricity primarily for the consumption of a 4140
mercantile customer member or a group of mercantile customer 4141
members; 4142
(b) Connect directly to the mercantile customer member's 4143
side of the electric meter; 4144
(c) Deliver electricity to the mercantile customer 4145
member's side of the electric meter without the use of an 4146
electric distribution utility's or an electric cooperative's 4147
distribution system or transmission system; 4148
(d) Is located on either of the following: 4149
(i) A property owned or controlled by a mercantile 4150
customer member or the entity that owns or operates the 4151
mercantile customer self-power system, provided that the 4152
property is not located more than one mile from the customer or 4153
group of customers that consume the electricity produced by the 4154
facilities; 4155
(ii) Land adjacent to a mercantile customer member if the 4156
facilities connect directly with the customer. 4157
(B) The mercantile customer self-power system may be owned 4158
or operated by a mercantile customer member, group of mercantile 4159
customer members, or an entity that is not a mercantile customer 4160
member. 4161
(C) A mercantile customer self-power system may provide 4162
electric generation service to one or more mercantile customers. 4163
(D) The public utilities commission shall adopt rules to 4164
implement this section that are applicable to electric 4165

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 144
As Passed by the Senate
distribution utilities. 4166
(E) Nothing in this section prohibits an electric 4167
distribution utility or an electric cooperative from charging a 4168
mercantile customer for distribution or transmission service 4169
used by a mercantile customer. 4170
Sec. 4929.20. (A)(A)(1) No governmental aggregator as 4171
defined in division (K)(1) of section 4929.01 of the Revised 4172
Code or no retail natural gas supplier shall provide a 4173
competitive retail natural gas service on or after thirteen 4174
months following the effective date of this section June 26, 4175
2001, to a consumer in this state without first being certified 4176
by the public utilities commission regarding its managerial, 4177
technical, and financial capability to provide that service and 4178
providing reasonable financial assurances sufficient to protect 4179
customers and natural gas companies from default. In addition, a 4180

Revised Code to be assessed by the tax commissioner shall be 4939
determined by a method of valuation using cost as capitalized on 4940
the public utility's books and records less composite annual 4941
allowances as prescribed by the commissioner. If the 4942

gas company may use a date other than the end of a calendar 4962
month to value its current gas stored underground. 4963
(C) The true value of noncurrent gas stored underground is 4964

As Passed by the Senate
during construction that has been capitalized on the public 4986
utility's books and records as part of the total cost of the 4987
taxable property. This division shall not apply to the taxable 4988
property of an electric company or a rural electric company, 4989
excluding transmission and distribution property, first placed 4990
into service after December 31, 2000, or to the taxable property 4991
a person purchases, which includes transfers, if that property 4992

number of revenue-earning miles traveled by the watercraft in 4998
the waters of this state and the denominator of which is the 4999
number of revenue-earning miles traveled by the watercraft in 5000
all waters. 5001
(G) The cost of property subject to a sale and leaseback 5002
transaction is the cost of the property as capitalized on the 5003
books and records of the public utility owning the property 5004
immediately prior to the sale and leaseback transaction. 5005
(H) The cost as capitalized on the books and records of a 5006
public utility includes amounts capitalized that represent 5007
regulatory assets, if such amounts previously were included on 5008
the company's books and records as capitalized costs of taxable 5009
personal property. 5010
(I) Any change in the composite annual allowances as 5011
prescribed by the commissioner on a prospective basis shall not 5012
be admissible in any judicial or administrative action or 5013

for tax years 2011 through the applicable year if all of the 5127
following conditions are satisfied: 5128
(a) On or before the last day of the tax year preceding 5129

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 177
As Passed by the Senate
the applicable year, the owner or a lessee pursuant to a sale 5130
and leaseback transaction of the project submits an application 5131
to the power siting board for a certificate under section 5132
4906.20 of the Revised Code, or if that section does not apply, 5133

for a certificate or other approval or permit described in 5142
division (B)(1)(a) of this section, or the date the contract for 5143
the construction or installation of the energy facility is 5144
entered into. 5145
(c) For a qualified energy project with a nameplate 5146
capacity of twenty megawatts or greater, a board of county 5147
commissioners of a county in which property of the project is 5148
located has adopted a resolution under division (E)(1)(b) or (c) 5149
of this section to approve the application submitted under 5150
division (E) of this section to exempt the property located in 5151
that county from taxation. A board's adoption of a resolution 5152
rejecting an application or its failure to adopt a resolution 5153
approving the application does not affect the tax-exempt status 5154
of the qualified energy project's property that is located in 5155
another county. 5156
(2) If tangible personal property of a qualified energy 5157
project using renewable energy resources was exempt from 5158
taxation under this section beginning in any of tax years 2011 5159

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 178
As Passed by the Senate
through the applicable year, and the certification under 5160
division (E)(2) of this section has not been revoked, the 5161
tangible personal property of the qualified energy project is 5162
exempt from taxation for the tax year following the applicable 5163
year and all ensuing tax years if the property was placed into 5164
service before the first day of the tax year following the 5165
applicable year, as certified in the construction progress 5166
report required under division (F)(2) of this section. Tangible 5167
personal property that has not been placed into service before 5168
that date is taxable property subject to taxation. An energy 5169
project for which certification has been revoked is ineligible 5170
for further exemption under this section. Revocation does not 5171
affect the tax-exempt status of the project's tangible personal 5172
property for the tax year in which revocation occurs or any 5173
prior tax year. 5174
(C) Tangible personal property of a qualified energy 5175
project using clean coal technology, advanced nuclear 5176
technology, or cogeneration technology is exempt from taxation 5177
for the first tax year that the property would be listed for 5178
taxation and all subsequent years if all of the following 5179
circumstances are met: 5180
(1) The property was placed into service before January 1, 5181
2021. Tangible personal property that has not been placed into 5182
service before that date is taxable property subject to 5183
taxation. 5184
(2) For such a qualified energy project with a nameplate 5185
capacity of twenty megawatts or greater, a board of county 5186
commissioners of a county in which property of the qualified 5187
energy project is located has adopted a resolution under 5188
division (E)(1)(b) or (c) of this section to approve the 5189

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 179
As Passed by the Senate
application submitted under division (E) of this section to 5190
exempt the property located in that county from taxation. A 5191
board's adoption of a resolution rejecting the application or 5192
its failure to adopt a resolution approving the application does 5193
not affect the tax-exempt status of the qualified energy 5194
project's property that is located in another county. 5195
(3) The certification for the qualified energy project 5196
issued under division (E)(2) of this section has not been 5197
revoked. An energy project for which certification has been 5198
revoked is ineligible for exemption under this section. 5199
Revocation does not affect the tax-exempt status of the 5200
project's tangible personal property for the tax year in which 5201
revocation occurs or any prior tax year. 5202
(D) Except as otherwise provided in this section, real 5203
property of a qualified energy project is exempt from taxation 5204
for any tax year for which the tangible personal property of the 5205
qualified energy project is exempted under this section. 5206
(E)(1)(a) A person may apply to the director of 5207
development for certification of an energy project as a 5208
qualified energy project on or before the following dates: 5209
(i) The last day of the tax year preceding the applicable 5210
year, for an energy project using renewable energy resources; 5211
(ii) December 31, 2017, for an energy project using clean 5212
coal technology, advanced nuclear technology, or cogeneration 5213
technology. 5214
(b) The director shall forward a copy of each application 5215
for certification of an energy project with a nameplate capacity 5216
of twenty megawatts or greater to the board of county 5217
commissioners of each county in which the project is located and 5218

Am. Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 180
As Passed by the Senate
to each taxing unit with territory located in each of the 5219
affected counties. Any board that receives from the director a 5220
copy of an application submitted under this division shall adopt 5221
a resolution approving or rejecting the application unless it 5222
has adopted a resolution under division (E)(1)(c) of this 5223
section. A resolution adopted under division (E)(1)(b) or (c) of 5224
this section may require an annual service payment to be made in 5225
addition to the service payment required under division (G) of 5226
this section. The sum of the service payment required in the 5227
resolution and the service payment required under division (G) 5228
of this section shall not exceed nine thousand dollars per 5229
megawatt of nameplate capacity located in the county. The 5230
resolution shall specify the time and manner in which the 5231
payments required by the resolution shall be paid to the county 5232
treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the payment to the 5233
credit of the county's general fund to be used for any purpose 5234
for which money credited to that fund may be used. 5235
The board shall send copies of the resolution to the owner 5236
of the facility and the director by certified mail or, if the 5237
board has record of an internet identifier of record associated 5238
with the owner or director, by ordinary mail and by that 5239
internet identifier of record. The board shall send such notice 5240
within thirty days after receipt of the application, or a longer 5241
period of time if authorized by the director. 5242
(c) A board of county commissioners may adopt a resolution 5243
declaring the county to be an alternative energy zone and 5244
declaring all applications submitted to the director of 5245
development under this division after the adoption of the 5246
resolution, and prior to its repeal, to be approved by the 5247
board. 5248
