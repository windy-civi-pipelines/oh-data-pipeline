year that is measured and calculated in accordance with the 294
measurement and verification plan included in the contract, but 295
may not include guaranteed savings that are not measured or that 296
are stipulated in the contract. Regardless of the number of 297
renewals of the bond, the aggregate liability under each renewed 298
bond may not exceed the penal sum stated in the renewal 299
certificate for the applicable renewal year. 300

taxes in amounts sufficient to pay the interest on and retire 323
the notes, except that the total net indebtedness of the 324
district without a vote of the electors incurred under this and 325
all other sections of the Revised Code, except section 3318.052 326
of the Revised Code, shall not exceed one per cent of the 327
district's tax valuation. Revenues derived from local taxes or 328
otherwise, for the purpose of conserving energy or for defraying 329
the current operating expenses of the district, may be applied 330
to the payment of interest and the retirement of such notes. The 331

installment payment contract under division (B) of this section 339
unless it first obtains a report of the costs of the energy 340
conservation measures and the savings thereof as described under 341
division (G)(1) of section 133.06 of the Revised Code as a 342
requirement for issuing energy securities, makes a finding that 343

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 13
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
the amount spent on such measures is not likely to exceed the 344
amount of money it would save in energy costs and resultant 345
operational and maintenance costs as described in that division, 346
except that that finding shall cover the ensuing fifteen years, 347
and the facilities construction commission determines that the 348
district board's findings are reasonable and approves the 349
contract as described in that division. 350
The district board shall monitor the savings and maintain 351
a report of those savings, which shall be submitted to the 352
commission in the same manner as required by division (G) of 353
section 133.06 of the Revised Code in the case of energy 354
securities. 355
(G) A board of education may apply to the Ohio facilities 356
construction commission for a loan from the school energy 357
performance contracting loan fund, established by section 358
3313.378 of the Revised Code, for purposes of paying for all or 359

obligations on termination of the contract prior to its 374
expiration, are to be a stated percentage of calculated savings 375
of energy costs attributable to the energy saving measure over a 376
defined period of time and are to be made only to the extent 377
that such savings occur. A contract that requires any additional 378
capital investment or contribution of funds, other than funds 379
available from state or federal energy grants, or that is for an 380
initial term of longer than ten years is not a shared-savings 381
contract. 382
(B) The board of education of a city, local, exempted 383
village, or joint vocational school district may enter into a 384
shared-savings contract with any person experienced in the 385

Code, the valuation as of the date certain of the property of 1433
the public utility that is used and useful or, with respect to a 1434
natural gas, water-works, or sewage disposal system company, is 1435
projected to be used and useful as of the date certain, in 1436
rendering the public utility service for which rates are to be 1437
fixed and determined. The 1438
(b) With respect to an electric light company that chooses 1439
to file a forecasted test period under section 4909.18 of the 1440

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 51
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
Revised Code, and a reasonable allowance for materials and 1449
supplies and a reasonable allowance for cash working capital as 1450
determined by the commission. 1451
The commission, in its discretion, may include in the 1452
valuation a reasonable allowance for construction work in 1453
progress but, in no event, may such an allowance be made by the 1454
commission until it has determined that the particular 1455
construction project is at least seventy-five per cent complete. 1456
In determining the percentage completion of a particular 1457
construction project, the commission shall consider, among other 1458
relevant criteria, the per cent of time elapsed in construction; 1459
the per cent of construction funds, excluding allowance for 1460
funds used during construction, expended, or obligated to such 1461
construction funds budgeted where all such funds are adjusted to 1462
reflect current purchasing power; and any physical inspection 1463
performed by or on behalf of any party, including the 1464
commission's staff. 1465
A reasonable allowance for construction work in progress 1466
shall not exceed ten per cent of the total valuation as stated 1467
in this division, not including such allowance for construction 1468
work in progress. 1469
Where the commission permits an allowance for construction 1470
work in progress, the dollar value of the project or portion 1471
thereof included in the valuation as construction work in 1472
progress shall not be included in the valuation as plant in 1473
service until such time as the total revenue effect of the 1474
construction work in progress allowance is offset by the total 1475
revenue effect of the plant in service exclusion. Carrying 1476
charges calculated in a manner similar to allowance for funds 1477
used during construction shall accrue on that portion of the 1478

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 52
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
project in service but not reflected in rates as plant in 1479
service, and such accrued carrying charges shall be included in 1480
the valuation of the property at the conclusion of the offset 1481
period for purposes of division (C)(9) of section 4909.05 of the 1482
Revised Code. 1483
From and after April 10, 1985, no allowance for 1484
construction work in progress as it relates to a particular 1485
construction project shall be reflected in rates for a period 1486
exceeding forty-eight consecutive months commencing on the date 1487
the initial rates reflecting such allowance become effective, 1488
except as otherwise provided in this division. 1489
The applicable maximum period in rates for an allowance 1490
for construction work in progress as it relates to a particular 1491
construction project shall be tolled if, and to the extent, a 1492
delay in the in-service date of the project is caused by the 1493
action or inaction of any federal, state, county, or municipal 1494
agency having jurisdiction, where such action or inaction 1495
relates to a change in a rule, standard, or approval of such 1496
agency, and where such action or inaction is not the result of 1497
the failure of the utility to reasonably endeavor to comply with 1498
any rule, standard, or approval prior to such change. 1499
In the event that such period expires before the project 1500
goes into service, the commission shall exclude, from the date 1501
of expiration, the allowance for the project as construction 1502
work in progress from rates, except that the commission may 1503
extend the expiration date up to twelve months for good cause 1504
shown. 1505
In the event that a utility has permanently canceled, 1506
abandoned, or terminated construction of a project for which it 1507
was previously permitted a construction work in progress 1508

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 53
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
allowance, the commission immediately shall exclude the 1509
allowance for the project from the valuation. 1510
In the event that a construction work in progress project 1511
previously included in the valuation is removed from the 1512
valuation pursuant to this division, any revenues collected by 1513
the utility from its customers after April 10, 1985, that 1514
resulted from such prior inclusion shall be offset against 1515
future revenues over the same period of time as the project was 1516
included in the valuation as construction work in progress. The 1517
total revenue effect of such offset shall not exceed the total 1518
revenues previously collected. 1519
In no event shall the total revenue effect of any offset 1520
or offsets provided under division (A)(1) of this section exceed 1521
the total revenue effect of any construction work in progress 1522
allowance. 1523
(2) A fair and reasonable rate of return to the utility on 1524
the valuation as determined in division (A)(1) of this section; 1525
(3) The dollar annual return to which the utility is 1526
entitled by applying the fair and reasonable rate of return as 1527
determined under division (A)(2) of this section to the 1528
valuation of the utility determined under division (A)(1) of 1529
this section; 1530
(4) The cost to the utility of rendering the public 1531
utility service for the test period used for the determination 1532
under division (C)(1) of this section, less the total of any 1533
interest on cash or credit refunds paid, pursuant to section 1534
4909.42 of the Revised Code, by the utility during the test 1535
period. 1536

by net income may, in the discretion of the commission, be 1538
computed by the normalization method of accounting, provided the 1539
utility maintains accounting reserves that reflect differences 1540
between taxes actually payable and taxes on a normalized basis, 1541
provided that no determination as to the treatment in the rate- 1542
making process of such taxes shall be made that will result in 1543
loss of any tax depreciation or other tax benefit to which the 1544
utility would otherwise be entitled, and further provided that 1545
such tax benefit as redounds to the utility as a result of such 1546
a computation may not be retained by the company, used to fund 1547
any dividend or distribution, or utilized for any purpose other 1548
than the defrayal of the operating expenses of the utility and 1549
the defrayal of the expenses of the utility in connection with 1550
construction work. 1551

light company under section 5727.391 of the Revised Code for 1553
Ohio coal burned prior to January 1, 2000, shall not be retained 1554
by the company, used to fund any dividend or distribution, or 1555
utilized for any purposes other than the defrayal of the 1556
allowable operating expenses of the company and the defrayal of 1557
the allowable expenses of the company in connection with the 1558
installation, acquisition, construction, or use of a compliance 1559
facility. The amount of the tax credits granted to an electric 1560
light company under that section for Ohio coal burned prior to 1561
January 1, 2000, shall be returned to its customers within three 1562
years after initially claiming the credit through an offset to 1563
the company's rates or fuel component, as determined by the 1564
commission, as set forth in schedules filed by the company under 1565
section 4905.30 of the Revised Code. As used in division (A)(4) 1566

(B) The commission shall compute the gross annual revenues 1569
to which the utility is entitled by adding the dollar amount of 1570
return under division (A)(3) of this section to the cost, for 1571
the test period used for the determination under division (C)(1) 1572
of this section, of rendering the public utility service under 1573
division (A)(4) of this section. 1574
(C)(1) Except as provided in division (D) of this section, 1575
the revenues and expenses of the utility shall be determined 1576
during a test period. The utility may as follows: 1577
(a) Electric light companies may propose a forecasted test 1578
period. If the company proposes a forecasted test period, the 1579
company shall propose annual base rates for three consecutive 1580
twelve-month periods in a single forecasted test period 1581
application. During the first twelve-month period, the company 1582
may propose a reasonably forecasted rate base during a thirteen- 1583
month average, revenues, and expenses for the first twelve 1584
months that new base rates will be in effect. 1585
During the second twelve-month period, the base rate 1586
revenue requirement shall be adjusted for the return of, and 1587
return on, incremental rate base additions approved by the 1588
commission in the initial application. During the third twelve- 1589
month period, the base rate revenue requirement may be adjusted 1590
for the return of and return on incremental rate base additions 1591
approved by the commission in the initial application. 1592
For each twelve-month period, forecasted plant investment, 1593
forecasted revenue, and forecasted expenses versus actual 1594
investment, actual revenue, and actual expenses shall be trued 1595
up via a cost recovery mechanism approved by the commission. 1596
Each true-up process shall include an adjustment to actual 1597

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 56
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
for the rate of return that the company is authorized to earn on 1598
the actual investments made. The company shall provide the 1599
commission with actual financial information during the true-up 1600
process to ensure accuracy. As part of the true-up process, the 1601
commission shall include only rate base components that have 1602
been found by the commission to be used and useful in rendering 1603
public utility service. 1604
(b) All utilities, except for electric light companies 1605
that choose to file under division (C)(1)(a) of this section, 1606
shall propose a test period for this determination that is any 1607
twelve-month period beginning not more than six months prior to 1608
the date the application is filed and ending not more than nine 1609
months subsequent to that date. The test period for determining 1610
revenues and expenses of the utility shall be the test period 1611
proposed by the utility, unless otherwise ordered by the 1612
commission. 1613
(2) The For utilities filing under division (C)(1)(b) of 1614
this section, the date certain shall be not later than the date 1615
of filing, except that it shall be, for a natural gas, water- 1616

period immediately following the test period, reasonably 1624
expected to occur. The natural gas, water-works, or sewage 1625
disposal system company utility shall identify and quantify, 1626
individually, any proposed adjustments. The commission shall 1627

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 57

commission shall approve a reconciliation mechanism, other 2950
recovery mechanism, or a combination of such mechanisms for the 2951

utility. 2952
(D) The first application filed under this section by an 2953
electric distribution utility that, as of July 31, 2008, 2954
directly owns, in whole or in part, operating electric 2955
generating facilities that had been used and useful in this 2956
state shall require that a portion of that the utility's 2957
standard service offer load for the first five years of the 2958
market rate offer be competitively bid under division (A) of 2959
this section as follows: ten per cent of the load in year one, 2960
not more than twenty per cent in year two, thirty per cent in 2961
year three, forty per cent in year four, and fifty per cent in 2962
year five. Consistent with those percentages, the commission 2963
shall determine the actual percentages for each year of years 2964
one through five. The standard service offer price for retail 2965
electric generation service under this first application shall 2966
be a proportionate blend of the bid price and the generation 2967
service price for the remaining standard service offer load, 2968
which latter price shall be equal to the electric distribution 2969
utility's most recent standard service offer price, adjusted 2970
upward or downward as the commission determines reasonable, 2971
relative to the jurisdictional portion of any known and 2972
measurable changes from the level of any one or more of the 2973
following costs as reflected in that most recent standard 2974
service offer price: 2975
(1) The electric distribution utility's prudently incurred 2976
cost of fuel used to produce electricity; 2977
(2) Its prudently incurred purchased power costs; 2978
(3) Its prudently incurred costs of satisfying the supply 2979
and demand portfolio requirements of this state, including, but 2980
not limited to, renewable energy resource and energy efficiency 2981

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 103
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
requirements; 2982
(4) Its costs prudently incurred to comply with 2983
environmental laws and regulations, with consideration of the 2984
derating of any facility associated with those costs. 2985
In making any adjustment to the most recent standard 2986
service offer price on the basis of costs described in division 2987
(D) of this section, the commission shall include the benefits 2988
that may become available to the electric distribution utility 2989
as a result of or in connection with the costs included in the 2990
adjustment, including, but not limited to, the utility's receipt 2991
of emissions credits or its receipt of tax benefits or of other 2992
benefits, and, accordingly, the commission may impose such 2993
conditions on the adjustment to ensure that any such benefits 2994
are properly aligned with the associated cost responsibility. 2995
The commission shall also determine how such adjustments will 2996
affect the electric distribution utility's return on common 2997
equity that may be achieved by those adjustments. The commission 2998
shall not apply its consideration of the return on common equity 2999
to reduce any adjustments authorized under this division unless 3000
the adjustments will cause the electric distribution utility to 3001
earn a return on common equity that is significantly in excess 3002
of the return on common equity that is earned by publicly traded 3003
companies, including utilities, that face comparable business 3004
and financial risk, with such adjustments for capital structure 3005
as may be appropriate. The burden of proof for demonstrating 3006
that significantly excessive earnings will not occur shall be on 3007
the electric distribution utility. 3008
Additionally, the commission may adjust the electric 3009
distribution utility's most recent standard service offer price 3010
by such just and reasonable amount that the commission 3011

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 104
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
determines necessary to address any emergency that threatens the 3012
utility's financial integrity or to ensure that the resulting 3013
revenue available to the utility for providing the standard 3014
service offer is not so inadequate as to result, directly or 3015
indirectly, in a taking of property without compensation 3016
pursuant to Section 19 of Article I, Ohio Constitution. The 3017
electric distribution utility has the burden of demonstrating 3018
that any adjustment to its most recent standard service offer 3019
price is proper in accordance with this division. 3020
(E) Beginning in the second year of a blended price under 3021
division (D) of this section and notwithstanding any other 3022
requirement of this section, the commission may alter 3023
prospectively the proportions specified in that division to 3024
mitigate any effect of an abrupt or significant change in the 3025
electric distribution utility's standard service offer price 3026
that would otherwise result in general or with respect to any 3027
rate group or rate schedule but for such alteration. Any such 3028
alteration shall be made not more often than annually, and the 3029
commission shall not, by altering those proportions and in any 3030
event, including because of the length of time, as authorized 3031
under division (C) of this section, taken to approve the market 3032
rate offer, cause the duration of the blending period to exceed 3033
ten years as counted from the effective date of the approved 3034
market rate offer. Additionally, any such alteration shall be 3035
limited to an alteration affecting the prospective proportions 3036
used during the blending period and shall not affect any 3037
blending proportion previously approved and applied by the 3038
commission under this division. 3039
(F) An electric distribution utility that has received 3040
commission approval of its first application under division (C) 3041
of this section shall not, nor ever shall be authorized or 3042

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 105
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
required by the commission to, file an application under section 3043
4928.143 of the Revised Code. 3044
Sec. 4928.144. The public utilities commission by order 3045
may authorize any just and reasonable phase-in of any electric 3046
distribution utility rate or price established under sections 3047
4928.141 to 4928.143 and 4928.142 of the Revised Code, and 3048
inclusive of carrying charges, as the commission considers 3049
necessary to ensure rate or price stability for consumers. If 3050
the commission's order includes such a phase-in, the order also 3051
shall provide for the creation of regulatory assets pursuant to 3052
generally accepted accounting principles, by authorizing the 3053
deferral of incurred costs equal to the amount not collected, 3054
plus carrying charges on that amount. Further, the order shall 3055
authorize the collection of those deferrals through a 3056
nonbypassable surcharge on any such rate or price so established 3057
for the electric distribution utility by the commission. 3058
Sec. 4928.149. No electric distribution utility may use 3059
any electric energy storage system to participate in the 3060
wholesale market, if the utility purchased or acquired that 3061
system for distribution service. 3062
Sec. 4928.1410. If an electric distribution utility has a n 3063
existing electric security plan under which the commission had 3064
authorized the creation or continuation of riders, then, to the 3065
extent those riders will cease to exist after termination of the 3066
electric security plan, the electric distribution utility is 3067
authorized to create necessary regulatory assets or liabilities, 3068
along with carrying costs at the utility's weighted average cost 3069
of debt, for the resolution of any outstanding under-collection 3070
or over-collection of funds under such riders. The resolution of 3071
such regulatory assets or liabilities shall be addressed in the 3072

first distribution rate case under section 4909.18 of the 3073
Revised Code that occurs after the plan's expiration. 3074
Sec. 4928.17. (A) Except as otherwise provided in sections 3075
4928.141 or 4928.142 or 4928.143 or 4928.31 to 4928.40 of the 3076
Revised Code and beginning on the starting date of competitive 3077
retail electric service, no electric utility shall engage in 3078
this state, either directly or through an affiliate, in the 3079
businesses of supplying a noncompetitive retail electric service 3080
and supplying a competitive retail electric service, or in the 3081
businesses of supplying a noncompetitive retail electric service 3082
and supplying a product or service other than retail electric 3083
service, unless the utility implements and operates under a 3084
corporate separation plan that is approved by the public 3085
utilities commission under this section, is consistent with the 3086
policy specified in section 4928.02 of the Revised Code, and 3087
achieves all of the following: 3088
(1) The plan provides, at minimum, for the provision of 3089
the competitive retail electric service or the nonelectric 3090
product or service through a fully separated affiliate of the 3091
utility, and the plan includes separate accounting requirements, 3092
the code of conduct as ordered by the commission pursuant to a 3093
rule it shall adopt under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the 3094
Revised Code, and such other measures as are necessary to 3095
effectuate the policy specified in section 4928.02 of the 3096
Revised Code. 3097
(2) The plan satisfies the public interest in preventing 3098
unfair competitive advantage and preventing the abuse of market 3099
power. 3100
(3) The plan is sufficient to ensure that the utility will 3101
not extend any undue preference or advantage to any affiliate, 3102

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 107
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
division, or part of its own business engaged in the business of 3103
supplying the competitive retail electric service or nonelectric 3104
product or service, including, but not limited to, utility 3105
resources such as trucks, tools, office equipment, office space, 3106
supplies, customer and marketing information, advertising, 3107
billing and mailing systems, personnel, and training, without 3108
compensation based upon fully loaded embedded costs charged to 3109
the affiliate; and to ensure that any such affiliate, division, 3110
or part will not receive undue preference or advantage from any 3111
affiliate, division, or part of the business engaged in business 3112
of supplying the noncompetitive retail electric service. No such 3113
utility, affiliate, division, or part shall extend such undue 3114
preference. Notwithstanding any other division of this section, 3115
a utility's obligation under division (A)(3) of this section 3116
shall be effective January 1, 2000. 3117
(B) The commission may approve, modify and approve, or 3118
disapprove a corporate separation plan filed with the commission 3119
under division (A) of this section. As part of the code of 3120
conduct required under division (A)(1) of this section, the 3121
commission shall adopt rules pursuant to division (A) of section 3122
4928.06 of the Revised Code regarding corporate separation and 3123
procedures for plan filing and approval. The rules shall include 3124
limitations on affiliate practices solely for the purpose of 3125
maintaining a separation of the affiliate's business from the 3126
business of the utility to prevent unfair competitive advantage 3127
abuse of market power by virtue of that relationship. The rules 3128
also shall include an opportunity for any person having a real 3129
and substantial interest in the corporate separation plan to 3130
file specific objections to the plan and propose specific 3131
responses to issues raised in the objections, which objections 3132
and responses the commission shall address in its final order. 3133

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 108
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
Prior to commission approval of the plan, the commission shall 3134
afford a hearing upon those aspects of the plan that the 3135
commission determines reasonably require a hearing. The 3136
commission may reject and require refiling of a substantially 3137
inadequate plan under this section. 3138
(C) The commission shall issue an order approving or 3139
modifying and approving a corporate separation plan under this 3140
section, to be effective on the date specified in the order, 3141
only upon findings that the plan reasonably complies with the 3142
requirements of division (A) of this section and will provide 3143
for ongoing compliance with the policy specified in section 3144
4928.02 of the Revised Code. However, for good cause shown, the 3145
commission may issue an order approving or modifying and 3146
approving a corporate separation plan under this section that 3147
does not comply with division (A)(1) of this section but 3148
complies with such functional separation requirements as the 3149
commission authorizes to apply for an interim period prescribed 3150
in the order, upon a finding that such alternative plan will 3151
provide for ongoing compliance with the policy specified in 3152
section 4928.02 of the Revised Code. 3153
(D) Any party may seek an amendment to a corporate 3154
separation plan approved under this section, and the commission, 3155
pursuant to a request from any party or on its own initiative, 3156
may order as it considers necessary the filing of an amended 3157
corporate separation plan to reflect changed circumstances. 3158
(E) No electric distribution utility shall sell or 3159
transfer any generating asset it wholly or partly owns at any 3160
time without obtaining prior commission approval. 3161
Sec. 4928.20. (A) The legislative authority of a municipal 3162
corporation may adopt an ordinance, or the board of township 3163

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 109
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
trustees of a township or the board of county commissioners of a 3164
county may adopt a resolution, under which, on or after the 3165
starting date of competitive retail electric service, it may 3166
aggregate in accordance with this section the retail electrical 3167
loads located, respectively, within the municipal corporation, 3168
township, or unincorporated area of the county and, for that 3169
purpose, may enter into service agreements to facilitate for 3170
those loads the sale and purchase of electricity. The 3171
legislative authority or board also may exercise such authority 3172
jointly with any other such legislative authority or board. For 3173
customers that are not mercantile customers, an ordinance or 3174
resolution under this division shall specify whether the 3175
aggregation will occur only with the prior, affirmative consent 3176
of each person owning, occupying, controlling, or using an 3177
electric load center proposed to be aggregated or will occur 3178
automatically for all such persons pursuant to the opt-out 3179
requirements of division (D) of this section. The aggregation of 3180
mercantile customers shall occur only with the prior, 3181
affirmative consent of each such person owning, occupying, 3182
controlling, or using an electric load center proposed to be 3183
aggregated. Nothing in this division, however, authorizes the 3184
aggregation of the retail electric loads of an electric load 3185
center, as defined in section 4933.81 of the Revised Code, that 3186
is located in the certified territory of a nonprofit electric 3187
supplier under sections 4933.81 to 4933.90 of the Revised Code 3188
or an electric load center served by transmission or 3189
distribution facilities of a municipal electric utility. 3190
(B) If an ordinance or resolution adopted under division 3191
(A) of this section specifies that aggregation of customers that 3192
are not mercantile customers will occur automatically as 3193
described in that division, the ordinance or resolution shall 3194

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 110
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
direct the board of elections to submit the question of the 3195
authority to aggregate to the electors of the respective 3196
municipal corporation, township, or unincorporated area of a 3197
county at a special election on the day of the next primary or 3198
general election in the municipal corporation, township, or 3199
county. The legislative authority or board shall certify a copy 3200
of the ordinance or resolution to the board of elections not 3201
less than ninety days before the day of the special election. No 3202
ordinance or resolution adopted under division (A) of this 3203
section that provides for an election under this division shall 3204
take effect unless approved by a majority of the electors voting 3205
upon the ordinance or resolution at the election held pursuant 3206
to this division. 3207
(C) Upon the applicable requisite authority under 3208
divisions (A) and (B) of this section, the legislative authority 3209
or board shall develop a plan of operation and governance for 3210
the aggregation program so authorized. Before adopting a plan 3211
under this division, the legislative authority or board shall 3212
hold at least two public hearings on the plan. Before the first 3213
hearing, the legislative authority or board shall publish notice 3214
of the hearings once a week for two consecutive weeks in a 3215
newspaper of general circulation in the jurisdiction or as 3216
provided in section 7.16 of the Revised Code. The notice shall 3217
summarize the plan and state the date, time, and location of 3218
each hearing. 3219
(D) No legislative authority or board, pursuant to an 3220
ordinance or resolution under divisions (A) and (B) of this 3221
section that provides for automatic aggregation of customers 3222
that are not mercantile customers as described in division (A) 3223
of this section, shall aggregate the electrical load of any 3224
electric load center located within its jurisdiction unless it 3225

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 111
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
in advance clearly discloses to the person owning, occupying, 3226
controlling, or using the load center that the person will be 3227
enrolled automatically in the aggregation program and will 3228
remain so enrolled unless the person affirmatively elects by a 3229
stated procedure not to be so enrolled. The disclosure shall 3230
state prominently the rates, charges, and other terms and 3231
conditions of enrollment. The stated procedure shall allow any 3232
person enrolled in the aggregation program the opportunity to 3233
opt out of the program every three years, without paying a 3234
switching fee. Any such person that opts out before the 3235
commencement of the aggregation program pursuant to the stated 3236
procedure shall default to the standard service offer provided 3237
under section 4928.14 or division (D) of section 4928.35 of the 3238
Revised Code until the person chooses an alternative supplier. 3239
(E)(1) With respect to a governmental aggregation for a 3240
municipal corporation that is authorized pursuant to divisions 3241
(A) to (D) of this section, resolutions may be proposed by 3242
initiative or referendum petitions in accordance with sections 3243
731.28 to 731.41 of the Revised Code. 3244
(2) With respect to a governmental aggregation for a 3245
township or the unincorporated area of a county, which 3246
aggregation is authorized pursuant to divisions (A) to (D) of 3247
this section, resolutions may be proposed by initiative or 3248
referendum petitions in accordance with sections 731.28 to 3249
731.40 of the Revised Code, except that: 3250
(a) The petitions shall be filed, respectively, with the 3251
township fiscal officer or the board of county commissioners, 3252
who shall perform those duties imposed under those sections upon 3253
the city auditor or village clerk. 3254
(b) The petitions shall contain the signatures of not less 3255

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 112
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
than ten per cent of the total number of electors in, 3256
respectively, the township or the unincorporated area of the 3257
county who voted for the office of governor at the preceding 3258
general election for that office in that area. 3259
(F) A governmental aggregator under division (A) of this 3260
section is not a public utility engaging in the wholesale 3261
purchase and resale of electricity, and provision of the 3262
aggregated service is not a wholesale utility transaction. A 3263
governmental aggregator shall be subject to supervision and 3264
regulation by the public utilities commission only to the extent 3265
of any competitive retail electric service it provides and 3266
commission authority under this chapter. 3267
(G) This section does not apply in the case of a municipal 3268
corporation that supplies such aggregated service to electric 3269
load centers to which its municipal electric utility also 3270
supplies a noncompetitive retail electric service through 3271
transmission or distribution facilities the utility singly or 3272
jointly owns or operates. 3273
(H) A governmental aggregator shall not include in its 3274
aggregation the accounts of any of the following: 3275
(1) A customer that has opted out of the aggregation; 3276
(2) A customer in contract with a certified electric 3277
services company; 3278
(3) A customer that has a special contract with an 3279
electric distribution utility; 3280
(4) A customer that is not located within the governmental 3281
aggregator's governmental boundaries; 3282
(5) Subject to division (C) of section 4928.21 of the 3283

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 113
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
Revised Code, a customer who appears on the "do not aggregate" 3284
list maintained under that section. 3285
(I) Customers that are part of a governmental aggregation 3286
under this section shall be responsible only for such portion of 3287
a surcharge under section 4928.144 of the Revised Code that is 3288
proportionate to the benefits, as determined by the commission, 3289
that electric load centers within the jurisdiction of the 3290
governmental aggregation as a group receive. The proportionate 3291
surcharge so established shall apply to each customer of the 3292
governmental aggregation while the customer is part of that 3293
aggregation. If a customer ceases being such a customer, the 3294
otherwise applicable surcharge shall apply. Nothing in this 3295
section shall result in less than full recovery by an electric 3296
distribution utility of any surcharge authorized under section 3297
4928.144 of the Revised Code. Nothing in this section shall 3298
result in less than the full and timely imposition, charging, 3299
collection, and adjustment by an electric distribution utility, 3300
its assignee, or any collection agent, of the phase-in-recovery 3301
charges authorized pursuant to a final financing order issued 3302
pursuant to sections 4928.23 to 4928.2318 of the Revised Code. 3303
(J) On behalf of the customers that are part of a 3304
governmental aggregation under this section and by filing 3305
written notice with the public utilities commission, the 3306
legislative authority that formed or is forming that 3307
governmental aggregation may elect not to receive standby 3308
service within the meaning of division (B)(2)(d) of section 3309
4928.143 of the Revised Code from an electric distribution 3310
utility in whose certified territory the governmental 3311
aggregation is located and that operates under an approved 3312
electric security plan under that section. Upon the filing of 3313
that notice, the electric distribution utility shall not charge 3314

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 114
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
any such customer to whom competitive retail electric generation 3315
service is provided by another supplier under the governmental 3316
aggregation for the standby service. Any such consumer that 3317
returns to the utility for competitive retail electric service 3318
shall pay the market price of power incurred by the utility to 3319
serve that consumer plus any amount attributable to the 3320
utility's cost of compliance with the renewable energy resource 3321
provisions of section 4928.64 of the Revised Code to serve the 3322
consumer. Such market price shall include, but not be limited 3323
to, capacity and energy charges; all charges associated with the 3324
provision of that power supply through the regional transmission 3325
organization, including, but not limited to, transmission, 3326
ancillary services, congestion, and settlement and 3327
administrative charges; and all other costs incurred by the 3328
utility that are associated with the procurement, provision, and 3329
administration of that power supply, as such costs may be 3330
approved by the commission. The period of time during which the 3331
market price and renewable energy resource amount shall be so 3332
assessed on the consumer shall be from the time the consumer so 3333
returns to the electric distribution utility until the 3334
expiration of the electric security plan. However, if that 3335
period of time is expected to be more than two years, the 3336
commission may reduce the time period to a period of not less 3337
than two years. 3338
(K) The commission shall adopt rules and issue orders in 3339
proceedings under sections 4928.141 and 4928.142 of the Revised 3340
Code to encourage and promote large-scale governmental 3341
aggregation in this state. For that purpose, the commission 3342
shall conduct an immediate review of any rules it has adopted 3343
for the purpose of this section that are in effect on the 3344
effective date of the amendment of this section by S.B. 221 of 3345

the 127th general assembly, July 31, 2008. Further, within the 3346
context of an electric security plan under section 4928.143 of 3347
the Revised Code, as that section existed prior to its repeal by 3348
this act, or a market rate offer under section 4928.142 of the 3349
Revised Code, as amended by this act, the commission shall 3350
consider the effect on large-scale governmental aggregation of 3351
any nonbypassable generation charges, however collected, under 3352
that plan, or that would be established under that planoffer, 3353
except any nonbypassable generation charges that relate to any 3354
cost incurred by the electric distribution utility, the deferral 3355
of which has been authorized by the commission prior to the 3356
effective date of the amendment of this section by S.B. 221 of 3357
the 127th general assembly, July 31, 2008. 3358
Sec. 4928.23. As used in sections 4928.23 to 4928.2318 of 3359
the Revised Code: 3360
(A) "Ancillary agreement" means any bond insurance policy, 3361
letter of credit, reserve account, surety bond, swap 3362
arrangement, hedging arrangement, liquidity or credit support 3363
arrangement, or other similar agreement or arrangement entered 3364
into in connection with the issuance of phase-in-recovery bonds 3365
that is designed to promote the credit quality and marketability 3366
of the bonds or to mitigate the risk of an increase in interest 3367
rates. 3368
(B) "Assignee" means any person or entity to which an 3369
interest in phase-in-recovery property is sold, assigned, 3370
transferred, or conveyed, other than as security, and any 3371
successor to or subsequent assignee of such a person or entity. 3372
(C) "Bond" includes debentures, notes, certificates of 3373
participation, certificates of beneficial interest, certificates 3374

first makes all of the following determinations: 3656
(1) The unbundled components for the electric transmission 3657
component of retail electric service, as specified in the 3658
utility's rate unbundling plan required by division (A)(1) of 3659
section 4928.31 of the Revised Code, equal the tariff rates 3660
determined by the federal energy regulatory commission that are 3661
in effect on the date of the approval of the transition plan 3662
under sections 4928.31 to 4928.40 of the Revised Code, as each 3663
such rate is determined applicable to each particular customer 3664
class and rate schedule by the commission. The unbundled 3665

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 126
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
transmission component shall include a sliding scale of charges 3666
under division (B) of section 4905.31 of the Revised Code to 3667
ensure that refunds determined or approved by the federal energy 3668
regulatory commission are flowed through to retail electric 3669
customers. 3670
(2) The unbundled components for retail electric 3671
distribution service in the rate unbundling plan equal the 3672
difference between the costs attributable to the utility's 3673
transmission and distribution rates and charges under its 3674
schedule of rates and charges in effect on the effective date of 3675
this section, based upon the record in the most recent rate 3676
proceeding of the utility for which the utility's schedule was 3677
established, and the tariff rates for electric transmission 3678
service determined by the federal energy regulatory commission 3679
as described in division (A)(1) of this section. 3680
(3) All other unbundled components required by the 3681
commission in the rate unbundling plan equal the costs 3682
attributable to the particular service as reflected in the 3683
utility's schedule of rates and charges in effect on the 3684
effective date of this section. 3685
(4) The unbundled components for retail electric 3686
generation service in the rate unbundling plan equal the 3687
residual amount remaining after the determination of the 3688
transmission, distribution, and other unbundled components, and 3689
after any adjustments necessary to reflect the effects of the 3690
amendment of section 5727.111 of the Revised Code by Sub. S.B. 3691
No. 3 of the 123rd general assembly. 3692
(5) All unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan 3693
have been adjusted to reflect any base rate reductions on file 3694
with the commission and as scheduled to be in effect by December 3695

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 127
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
31, 2005, under rate settlements in effect on the effective date 3696
of this section. However, all earnings obligations, 3697
restrictions, or caps imposed on an electric utility in a 3698
commission order prior to the effective date of this section are 3699
void. 3700
(6) Subject to division (A)(5) of this section, the total 3701
of all unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan are 3702
capped and shall equal during the market development period, 3703
except as specifically provided in this chapter, the total of 3704
all rates and charges in effect under the applicable bundled 3705
schedule of the electric utility pursuant to section 4905.30 of 3706
the Revised Code in effect on the day before the effective date 3707
of this section, including the transition charge determined 3708
under section 4928.40 of the Revised Code, adjusted for any 3709
changes in the taxation of electric utilities and retail 3710
electric service under Sub. S.B. No. 3 of the 123rd General 3711
Assembly, the universal service rider authorized by section 3712
4928.51 of the Revised Code, and the temporary rider authorized 3713
by section 4928.61 of the Revised Code. For the purpose of this 3714
division, the rate cap applicable to a customer receiving 3715
electric service pursuant to an arrangement approved by the 3716
commission under section 4905.31 of the Revised Code is, for the 3717
term of the arrangement, the total of all rates and charges in 3718
effect under the arrangement. For any rate schedule filed 3719
pursuant to section 4905.30 of the Revised Code or any 3720
arrangement subject to approval pursuant to section 4905.31 of 3721
the Revised Code, the initial tax-related adjustment to the rate 3722
cap required by this division shall be equal to the rate of 3723
taxation specified in section 5727.81 of the Revised Code and 3724
applicable to the schedule or arrangement. To the extent such 3725
total annual amount of the tax-related adjustment is greater 3726

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 128
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
than or less than the comparable amount of the total annual tax 3727
reduction experienced by the electric utility as a result of the 3728
provisions of Sub. S.B. No. 3 of the 123rd general assembly, 3729
such difference shall be addressed by the commission through 3730
accounting procedures, refunds, or an annual surcharge or credit 3731
to customers, or through other appropriate means, to avoid 3732
placing the financial responsibility for the difference upon the 3733
electric utility or its shareholders. Any adjustments in the 3734
rate of taxation specified in section 5727.81 of the Revised 3735
Code section shall not occur without a corresponding adjustment 3736
to the rate cap for each such rate schedule or arrangement. The 3737
department of taxation shall advise the commission and self- 3738
assessors under section 5727.81 of the Revised Code prior to the 3739
effective date of any change in the rate of taxation specified 3740
under that section, and the commission shall modify the rate cap 3741
to reflect that adjustment so that the rate cap adjustment is 3742
effective as of the effective date of the change in the rate of 3743
taxation. This division shall be applied, to the extent 3744
possible, to eliminate any increase in the price of electricity 3745
for customers that otherwise may occur as a result of 3746
establishing the taxes contemplated in section 5727.81 of the 3747
Revised Code. 3748
(7) The rate unbundling plan complies with any rules 3749
adopted by the commission under division (A) of section 4928.06 3750
of the Revised Code. 3751
(8) The corporate separation plan required by division (A) 3752
(2) of section 4928.31 of the Revised Code complies with section 3753

commission under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the Revised 3755
Code. 3756

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 129
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
(9) Any plan or plans the commission requires to address 3757
operational support systems and any other technical 3758
implementation issues pertaining to competitive retail electric 3759
service comply with any rules adopted by the commission under 3760
division (A) of section 4928.06 of the Revised Code. 3761
(10) The employee assistance plan required by division (A) 3762
(4) of section 4928.31 of the Revised Code sufficiently provides 3763
severance, retraining, early retirement, retention, 3764
outplacement, and other assistance for the utility's employees 3765
whose employment is affected by electric industry restructuring 3766
under this chapter. 3767
(11) The consumer education plan required under division 3768
(A)(5) of section 4928.31 of the Revised Code complies with 3769
former section 4928.42 of the Revised Code and any rules adopted 3770
by the commission under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the 3771
Revised Code. 3772
(12) The transition revenues for which an electric utility 3773
is authorized a revenue opportunity under sections 4928.31 to 3774
4928.40 of the Revised Code are the allowable transition costs 3775
of the utility as such costs are determined by the commission 3776

under section 4928.33 of the Revised Code but not containing an 3796
approved independent transmission plan shall contain the express 3797
conditions that the utility will comply with an order issued 3798
under division (G) of section 4928.35 of the Revised Code. 3799
(B) Subject to division (E) of section 4928.17 of the 3800
Revised Code, if If the commission finds that any part of the 3801
transition plan would constitute an abandonment under sections 3802
4905.20 and 4905.21 of the Revised Code, the commission shall 3803
not approve that part of the transition plan unless it makes the 3804
finding required for approval of an abandonment application 3805
under section 4905.21 of the Revised Code. Sections 4905.20 and 3806
4905.21 of the Revised Code otherwise shall not apply to a 3807
transition plan under sections 4928.31 to 4928.40 of the Revised 3808

(2) For the purpose of this section and as it considers 3852
appropriate, the public utilities commission may classify any 3853
new technology as such a qualifying renewable energy resource. 3854
(B)(1) By the end of 2026, an electric distribution 3855
utility shall have provided from qualifying renewable energy 3856
resources, including, at its discretion, qualifying renewable 3857
energy resources obtained pursuant to an electricity supply 3858
contract, a portion of the electricity supply required for its 3859
standard service offer under section sections 4928.141 and 3860
4928.142 of the Revised Code, and an electric services company 3861
shall have provided a portion of its electricity supply for 3862
retail consumers in this state from qualifying renewable energy 3863
resources, including, at its discretion, qualifying renewable 3864
energy resources obtained pursuant to an electricity supply 3865
contract. That portion shall equal eight and one-half per cent 3866
of the total number of kilowatt hours of electricity sold by the 3867
subject utility or company to any and all retail electric 3868
consumers whose electric load centers are served by that utility 3869
and are located within the utility's certified territory or, in 3870
the case of an electric services company, are served by the 3871
company and are located within this state. However, nothing in 3872
this section precludes a utility or company from providing a 3873

(3) The qualifying renewable energy resources implemented 3880
by the utility or company shall be met either: 3881
(a) Through facilities located in this state; or 3882
(b) With resources that can be shown to be deliverable 3883
into this state. 3884
(C)(1) The commission annually shall review an electric 3885
distribution utility's or electric services company's compliance 3886
with the most recent applicable benchmark under division (B)(2) 3887
of this section and, in the course of that review, shall 3888
identify any undercompliance or noncompliance of the utility or 3889
company that it determines is weather-related, related to 3890
equipment or resource shortages for qualifying renewable energy 3891
resources as applicable, or is otherwise outside the utility's 3892
or company's control. 3893
(2) Subject to the cost cap provisions of division (C)(3) 3894
of this section, if the commission determines, after notice and 3895
opportunity for hearing, and based upon its findings in that 3896
review regarding avoidable undercompliance or noncompliance, but 3897
subject to division (C)(4) of this section, that the utility or 3898
company has failed to comply with any such benchmark, the 3899
commission shall impose a renewable energy compliance payment on 3900

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 135
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
the utility or company. 3901
(a) The compliance payment pertaining to the solar energy 3902
resource benchmarks under division (B)(2) of this section shall 3903
be an amount per megawatt hour of undercompliance or 3904
noncompliance in the period under review, as follows: 3905
(i) Three hundred dollars for 2014, 2015, and 2016; 3906
(ii) Two hundred fifty dollars for 2017 and 2018; 3907
(iii) Two hundred dollars for 2019. 3908
(b) The compliance payment pertaining to the renewable 3909
energy resource benchmarks under division (B)(2) of this section 3910
shall equal the number of additional renewable energy credits 3911
that the electric distribution utility or electric services 3912
company would have needed to comply with the applicable 3913
benchmark in the period under review times an amount that shall 3914
begin at forty-five dollars and shall be adjusted annually by 3915
the commission to reflect any change in the consumer price index 3916
as defined in section 101.27 of the Revised Code, but shall not 3917
be less than forty-five dollars. As used in this division, 3918
"consumer price index" means the consumer price index prepared 3919
by the United States bureau of labor statistics (U.S. city 3920
average for urban wage earners and clerical workers: all items, 3921
1982-1984=100), or, if that index is no longer published, a 3922
generally available comparable index. 3923
(c) The compliance payment shall not be passed through by 3924
the electric distribution utility or electric services company 3925
to consumers. The compliance payment shall be remitted to the 3926
commission, for deposit to the credit of the advanced energy 3927
fund created under section 4928.61 of the Revised Code. Payment 3928
of the compliance payment shall be subject to such collection 3929

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 136
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
and enforcement procedures as apply to the collection of a 3930
forfeiture under sections 4905.55 to 4905.60 and 4905.64 of the 3931
Revised Code. 3932
(3) An electric distribution utility or an electric 3933
services company need not comply with a benchmark under division 3934
(B)(2) of this section to the extent that its reasonably 3935
expected cost of that compliance exceeds its reasonably expected 3936
cost of otherwise producing or acquiring the requisite 3937
electricity by three per cent or more. The cost of compliance 3938
shall be calculated as though any exemption from taxes and 3939
assessments had not been granted under section 5727.75 of the 3940
Revised Code. 3941
(4)(a) An electric distribution utility or electric 3942
services company may request the commission to make a force 3943
majeure determination pursuant to this division regarding all or 3944
part of the utility's or company's compliance with any minimum 3945
benchmark under division (B)(2) of this section during the 3946
period of review occurring pursuant to division (C)(2) of this 3947
section. The commission may require the electric distribution 3948
utility or electric services company to make solicitations for 3949
renewable energy resource credits as part of its default service 3950
before the utility's or company's request of force majeure under 3951
this division can be made. 3952
(b) Within ninety days after the filing of a request by an 3953
electric distribution utility or electric services company under 3954
division (C)(4)(a) of this section, the commission shall 3955
determine if qualifying renewable energy resources are 3956
reasonably available in the marketplace in sufficient quantities 3957
for the utility or company to comply with the subject minimum 3958
benchmark during the review period. In making this 3959

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 137
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
determination, the commission shall consider whether the 3960
electric distribution utility or electric services company has 3961
made a good faith effort to acquire sufficient qualifying 3962
renewable energy or, as applicable, solar energy resources to so 3963
comply, including, but not limited to, by banking or seeking 3964
renewable energy resource credits or by seeking the resources 3965
through long-term contracts. Additionally, the commission shall 3966
consider the availability of qualifying renewable energy or 3967
solar energy resources in this state and other jurisdictions in 3968
the PJM interconnection regional transmission organization, 3969
L.L.C., or its successor and the midcontinent independent system 3970
operator or its successor. 3971
(c) If, pursuant to division (C)(4)(b) of this section, 3972
the commission determines that qualifying renewable energy or 3973
solar energy resources are not reasonably available to permit 3974
the electric distribution utility or electric services company 3975
to comply, during the period of review, with the subject minimum 3976
benchmark prescribed under division (B)(2) of this section, the 3977
commission shall modify that compliance obligation of the 3978
utility or company as it determines appropriate to accommodate 3979
the finding. Commission modification shall not automatically 3980
reduce the obligation for the electric distribution utility's or 3981
electric services company's compliance in subsequent years. If 3982
it modifies the electric distribution utility or electric 3983
services company obligation under division (C)(4)(c) of this 3984
section, the commission may require the utility or company, if 3985
sufficient renewable energy resource credits exist in the 3986
marketplace, to acquire additional renewable energy resource 3987
credits in subsequent years equivalent to the utility's or 3988
company's modified obligation under division (C)(4)(c) of this 3989
section. 3990

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 138
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
(5) The commission shall establish a process to provide 3991
for at least an annual review of the renewable energy resource 3992
market in this state and in the service territories of the 3993
regional transmission organizations that manage transmission 3994
systems located in this state. The commission shall use the 3995
results of this study to identify any needed changes to the 3996
amount of the renewable energy compliance payment specified 3997
under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of this section. Specifically, 3998
the commission may increase the amount to ensure that payment of 3999
compliance payments is not used to achieve compliance with this 4000
section in lieu of actually acquiring or realizing energy 4001
derived from qualifying renewable energy resources. However, if 4002
the commission finds that the amount of the compliance payment 4003
should be otherwise changed, the commission shall present this 4004
finding to the general assembly for legislative enactment. 4005
(D) The commission annually shall submit to the general 4006
assembly in accordance with section 101.68 of the Revised Code a 4007
report describing all of the following: 4008
(1) The compliance of electric distribution utilities and 4009
electric services companies with division (B) of this section; 4010
(2) The average annual cost of renewable energy credits 4011
purchased by utilities and companies for the year covered in the 4012
report; 4013
(3) Any strategy for utility and company compliance or for 4014
encouraging the use of qualifying renewable energy resources in 4015
supplying this state's electricity needs in a manner that 4016
considers available technology, costs, job creation, and 4017
economic impacts. 4018
The commission shall begin providing the information 4019

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 139
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
described in division (D)(2) of this section in each report 4020
submitted after September 10, 2012. The commission shall allow 4021
and consider public comments on the report prior to its 4022
submission to the general assembly. Nothing in the report shall 4023
be binding on any person, including any utility or company for 4024
the purpose of its compliance with any benchmark under division 4025
(B) of this section, or the enforcement of that provision under 4026
division (C) of this section. 4027
(E) All costs incurred by an electric distribution utility 4028
in complying with the requirements of this section shall be 4029
bypassable by any consumer that has exercised choice of supplier 4030
under section 4928.03 of the Revised Code. 4031
Sec. 4928.645. (A) An electric distribution utility or 4032
electric services company may use, for the purpose of complying 4033
with the requirements under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of section 4034
4928.64 of the Revised Code, renewable energy credits any time 4035
in the five calendar years following the date of their purchase 4036
or acquisition from any entity, including, but not limited to, 4037
the following: 4038
(1) A mercantile customer; 4039
(2) An owner or operator of a hydroelectric generating 4040
facility that is located at a dam on a river, or on any water 4041
discharged to a river, that is within or bordering this state or 4042
within or bordering an adjoining state, or that produces power 4043
that can be shown to be deliverable into this state; 4044
(3) A seller of compressed natural gas that has been 4045
produced from biologically derived methane gas, provided that 4046
the seller may only provide renewable energy credits for metered 4047
amounts of gas. 4048

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 140
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
(B)(1) The public utilities commission shall adopt rules 4049
specifying that one unit of credit shall equal one megawatt hour 4050
of electricity derived from renewable energy resources, except 4051
that, for a generating facility of seventy-five megawatts or 4052
greater that is situated within this state and has committed by 4053
December 31, 2009, to modify or retrofit its generating unit or 4054
units to enable the facility to generate principally from 4055
biomass energy by June 30, 2013, each megawatt hour of 4056
electricity generated principally from that biomass energy shall 4057
equal, in units of credit, the product obtained by multiplying 4058
the actual percentage of biomass feedstock heat input used to 4059
generate such megawatt hour by the quotient obtained by dividing 4060
the then existing unit dollar amount used to determine a 4061
renewable energy compliance payment as provided under division 4062
(C)(2)(b) of section 4928.64 of the Revised Code by the then 4063
existing market value of one renewable energy credit, but such 4064
megawatt hour shall not equal less than one unit of credit. 4065
Renewable energy resources do not have to be converted to 4066
electricity in order to be eligible to receive renewable energy 4067
credits. The rules shall specify that, for purposes of 4068
converting the quantity of energy derived from biologically 4069
derived methane gas to an electricity equivalent, one megawatt 4070
hour equals 3,412,142 British thermal units. 4071
(2) The rules also shall provide for this state a system 4072
of registering renewable energy credits by specifying which of 4073
any generally available registries shall be used for that 4074
purpose and not by creating a registry. That selected system of 4075
registering renewable energy credits shall allow a hydroelectric 4076
generating facility to be eligible for obtaining renewable 4077
energy credits and shall allow customer-sited projects or 4078
actions the broadest opportunities to be eligible for obtaining 4079

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 141
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
renewable energy credits. 4080
(C) Beginning January 1, 2020, a qualifying solar resource 4081
as defined in section 3706.40 of the Revised Code is not 4082
eligible to obtain a renewable energy credit under this section 4083
for any megawatt hour for which the resource has been issued a 4084
solar energy credit under section 3706.45 of the Revised Code. 4085
(D) Except for compressed natural gas that has been 4086
produced from biologically derived methane gas, energy generated 4087
by using natural gas as a resource is not eligible to obtain a 4088
renewable energy credit under this section. 4089
Sec. 4928.73. (A) As used in this section : 4090
(1) "Mercantile customer member" means a mercantile 4091
customer connected to a mercantile customer self-power system. 4092
(2) "Mercantile customer self-power system" means one or 4093
more electric generation facilities, electric storage 4094
facilities, or both, along with any associated facilities, that 4095
meet all of the following: 4096
(a) Produce electricity primarily for the consumption of a 4097
mercantile customer member or a group of mercantile customer 4098
members; 4099
(b) Connect directly to the mercantile customer member's 4100
side of the electric meter; 4101
(c) Deliver electricity to the mercantile customer 4102
member's side of the electric meter without the use of an 4103
electric distribution utility's or an electric cooperative's 4104
distribution system or transmission system; 4105
(d) Is located on either of the following: 4106

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 142
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
(i) A property owned or controlled by a mercantile 4107
customer member or the entity that owns or operates the 4108
mercantile customer self-power system, provided that the 4109
property is not located more than one mile from the customer or 4110
group of customers that consume the electricity produced by the 4111
facilities; 4112
(ii) Land adjacent to a mercantile customer member if the 4113
facilities connect directly with the customer. 4114
(B) The mercantile customer self-power system may be owned 4115
or operated by a mercantile customer member, group of mercantile 4116
customer members, or an entity that is not a mercantile customer 4117
member. 4118
(C) A mercantile customer self-power system may provide 4119
electric generation service to one or more mercantile customers. 4120
(D) The public utilities commission shall adopt rules to 4121
implement this section that are applicable to electric 4122
distribution utilities. 4123
(E) Nothing in this section prohibits an electric 4124
distribution utility or an electric cooperative from charging a 4125
mercantile customer for distribution or transmission service 4126
used by a mercantile customer. 4127
Sec. 4929.20. (A)(A)(1) No governmental aggregator as 4128
defined in division (K)(1) of section 4929.01 of the Revised 4129
Code or no retail natural gas supplier shall provide a 4130
competitive retail natural gas service on or after thirteen 4131
months following the effective date of this section June 26, 4132
2001, to a consumer in this state without first being certified 4133
by the public utilities commission regarding its managerial, 4134
technical, and financial capability to provide that service and 4135

providing reasonable financial assurances sufficient to protect 4136
customers and natural gas companies from default. In addition, a 4137
retail natural gas supplier may be required to provide a 4138
performance bond sufficient to protect customers and natural gas 4139
companies from default. Certification shall be granted pursuant 4140
to procedures and standards the commission shall prescribe in 4141
accordance with rules adopted under section 4929.10 of the 4142
Revised Code. However, certification or certification renewal 4143
shall be deemed approved thirty days after the filing of an 4144
application with the commission unless the commission suspends 4145
that approval for good cause shown. In the case of such a 4146
suspension, the commission shall act to approve or deny 4147
certification or certification renewal to the applicant not 4148
later than ninety days after the date of the suspension. 4149
(2) The commission shall establish rules to require a 4150
competitive retail natural gas supplier to maintain financial 4151
assurances sufficient to protect customers and natural gas 4152
companies from default. Such rules also shall specifically allow 4153
a natural gas company to set reasonable standards for its 4154
security and the security of its customers through financial 4155
requirements set in its tariffs. 4156
(3) As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "retail 4157
natural gas supplier" has the same meaning as in section 4929.01 4158
of the Revised Code, but excludes a broker or aggregator. 4159
(B) Capability standards adopted in rules pursuant to 4160
division (A) of this section shall be sufficient to ensure 4161
compliance with section 4929.22 of the Revised Code and with the 4162
minimum service requirements established under section 4929.23 4163
of the Revised Code. The standards shall allow flexibility for 4164
voluntary aggregation, to encourage market creativity in 4165

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 144

responding to consumer needs and demands. The rules shall 4166
include procedures for biennially renewing certification. 4167
(C)(1) The commission may suspend, rescind, or 4168
conditionally rescind the certification of any retail natural 4169
gas supplier or governmental aggregator issued under this 4170
section if the commission determines, after reasonable notice 4171
and opportunity for hearing, that the retail natural gas 4172
supplier or governmental aggregator has failed to comply with 4173
any applicable certification standards prescribed in rules 4174
adopted pursuant to this section or section 4929.22 of the 4175
Revised Code. 4176
(2) An affected natural gas company may file an 4177
application with the commission for approval of authority to 4178
recover in accordance with division (C)(2) of this section 4179
incremental costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the 4180
company in connection with the commission's continuation, 4181
suspension, rescission, or conditional rescission of a 4182
particular retail natural gas supplier's certification under 4183
division (C)(1) of this section. Upon the filing of such an 4184

Revised Code to be assessed by the tax commissioner shall be 4896
determined by a method of valuation using cost as capitalized on 4897
the public utility's books and records less composite annual 4898

gas company may use a date other than the end of a calendar 4919
month to value its current gas stored underground. 4920
(C) The true value of noncurrent gas stored underground is 4921

records less composite annual allowances as prescribed by the 4937
tax commissioner. 4938
(E) The true value of taxable property, except property of 4939
a railroad company, required by section 5727.06 of the Revised 4940

the allowance for funds used during construction or interest 4942
during construction that has been capitalized on the public 4943
utility's books and records as part of the total cost of the 4944
taxable property. This division shall not apply to the taxable 4945
property of an electric company or a rural electric company, 4946
excluding transmission and distribution property, first placed 4947
into service after December 31, 2000, or to the taxable property 4948

(H) The cost as capitalized on the books and records of a 4963
public utility includes amounts capitalized that represent 4964
regulatory assets, if such amounts previously were included on 4965
the company's books and records as capitalized costs of taxable 4966
personal property. 4967

taxes. Information about the business, property, or transactions 4972
of any taxpayer obtained by the commissioner for the purpose of 4973
adopting or modifying the composite annual allowances shall not 4974
be subject to discovery or disclosure. 4975

for tax years 2011 through the applicable year if all of the 5084
following conditions are satisfied: 5085
(a) On or before the last day of the tax year preceding 5086
the applicable year, the owner or a lessee pursuant to a sale 5087
and leaseback transaction of the project submits an application 5088
to the power siting board for a certificate under section 5089
4906.20 of the Revised Code, or if that section does not apply, 5090

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 176
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
for a certificate or other approval or permit described in 5099
division (B)(1)(a) of this section, or the date the contract for 5100
the construction or installation of the energy facility is 5101
entered into. 5102
(c) For a qualified energy project with a nameplate 5103
capacity of twenty megawatts or greater, a board of county 5104
commissioners of a county in which property of the project is 5105
located has adopted a resolution under division (E)(1)(b) or (c) 5106
of this section to approve the application submitted under 5107
division (E) of this section to exempt the property located in 5108
that county from taxation. A board's adoption of a resolution 5109
rejecting an application or its failure to adopt a resolution 5110
approving the application does not affect the tax-exempt status 5111
of the qualified energy project's property that is located in 5112
another county. 5113
(2) If tangible personal property of a qualified energy 5114
project using renewable energy resources was exempt from 5115
taxation under this section beginning in any of tax years 2011 5116
through the applicable year, and the certification under 5117
division (E)(2) of this section has not been revoked, the 5118
tangible personal property of the qualified energy project is 5119
exempt from taxation for the tax year following the applicable 5120
year and all ensuing tax years if the property was placed into 5121
service before the first day of the tax year following the 5122
applicable year, as certified in the construction progress 5123
report required under division (F)(2) of this section. Tangible 5124
personal property that has not been placed into service before 5125
that date is taxable property subject to taxation. An energy 5126
project for which certification has been revoked is ineligible 5127
for further exemption under this section. Revocation does not 5128
affect the tax-exempt status of the project's tangible personal 5129

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 177
As Reported by the Senate Energy Committee
property for the tax year in which revocation occurs or any 5130
prior tax year. 5131
(C) Tangible personal property of a qualified energy 5132
project using clean coal technology, advanced nuclear 5133
technology, or cogeneration technology is exempt from taxation 5134

taxation and all subsequent years if all of the following 5136
circumstances are met: 5137
(1) The property was placed into service before January 1, 5138
2021. Tangible personal property that has not been placed into 5139
service before that date is taxable property subject to 5140
taxation. 5141
(2) For such a qualified energy project with a nameplate 5142
capacity of twenty megawatts or greater, a board of county 5143
commissioners of a county in which property of the qualified 5144
energy project is located has adopted a resolution under 5145
division (E)(1)(b) or (c) of this section to approve the 5146
application submitted under division (E) of this section to 5147
exempt the property located in that county from taxation. A 5148
board's adoption of a resolution rejecting the application or 5149
its failure to adopt a resolution approving the application does 5150
not affect the tax-exempt status of the qualified energy 5151
project's property that is located in another county. 5152
(3) The certification for the qualified energy project 5153
issued under division (E)(2) of this section has not been 5154
revoked. An energy project for which certification has been 5155
revoked is ineligible for exemption under this section. 5156
Revocation does not affect the tax-exempt status of the 5157
project's tangible personal property for the tax year in which 5158
revocation occurs or any prior tax year. 5159

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 178
