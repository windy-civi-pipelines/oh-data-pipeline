Revised Code, and a reasonable allowance for materials and 1244
supplies and a reasonable allowance for cash working capital as 1245
determined by the commission. 1246
The commission, in its discretion, may include in the 1247
valuation a reasonable allowance for construction work in 1248
progress but, in no event, may such an allowance be made by the 1249
commission until it has determined that the particular 1250
construction project is at least seventy-five per cent complete. 1251
In determining the percentage completion of a particular 1252
construction project, the commission shall consider, among other 1253
relevant criteria, the per cent of time elapsed in construction; 1254
the per cent of construction funds, excluding allowance for 1255
funds used during construction, expended, or obligated to such 1256
construction funds budgeted where all such funds are adjusted to 1257
reflect current purchasing power; and any physical inspection 1258
performed by or on behalf of any party, including the 1259
commission's staff. 1260
A reasonable allowance for construction work in progress 1261
shall not exceed ten per cent of the total valuation as stated 1262
in this division, not including such allowance for construction 1263
work in progress. 1264
Where the commission permits an allowance for construction 1265
work in progress, the dollar value of the project or portion 1266
thereof included in the valuation as construction work in 1267
progress shall not be included in the valuation as plant in 1268
service until such time as the total revenue effect of the 1269
construction work in progress allowance is offset by the total 1270
revenue effect of the plant in service exclusion. Carrying 1271
charges calculated in a manner similar to allowance for funds 1272
used during construction shall accrue on that portion of the 1273
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 45

project in service but not reflected in rates as plant in 1274
service, and such accrued carrying charges shall be included in 1275
the valuation of the property at the conclusion of the offset 1276
period for purposes of division (C)(9) of section 4909.05 of the 1277
Revised Code. 1278
From and after April 10, 1985, no allowance for 1279
construction work in progress as it relates to a particular 1280
construction project shall be reflected in rates for a period 1281
exceeding forty-eight consecutive months commencing on the date 1282
the initial rates reflecting such allowance become effective, 1283
except as otherwise provided in this division. 1284
The applicable maximum period in rates for an allowance 1285
for construction work in progress as it relates to a particular 1286
construction project shall be tolled if, and to the extent, a 1287
delay in the in-service date of the project is caused by the 1288
action or inaction of any federal, state, county, or municipal 1289
agency having jurisdiction, where such action or inaction 1290
relates to a change in a rule, standard, or approval of such 1291
agency, and where such action or inaction is not the result of 1292
the failure of the utility to reasonably endeavor to comply with 1293
any rule, standard, or approval prior to such change. 1294
In the event that such period expires before the project 1295
goes into service, the commission shall exclude, from the date 1296
of expiration, the allowance for the project as construction 1297
work in progress from rates, except that the commission may 1298
extend the expiration date up to twelve months for good cause 1299
shown. 1300
In the event that a utility has permanently canceled, 1301
abandoned, or terminated construction of a project for which it 1302
was previously permitted a construction work in progress 1303
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 46

allowance, the commission immediately shall exclude the 1304
allowance for the project from the valuation. 1305
In the event that a construction work in progress project 1306
previously included in the valuation is removed from the 1307
valuation pursuant to this division, any revenues collected by 1308
the utility from its customers after April 10, 1985, that 1309
resulted from such prior inclusion shall be offset against 1310
future revenues over the same period of time as the project was 1311
included in the valuation as construction work in progress. The 1312
total revenue effect of such offset shall not exceed the total 1313
revenues previously collected. 1314
In no event shall the total revenue effect of any offset 1315
or offsets provided under division (A)(1) of this section exceed 1316
the total revenue effect of any construction work in progress 1317
allowance. 1318

this section; 1325
(4) The cost to the utility of rendering the public 1326

making process of such taxes shall be made that will result in 1338
loss of any tax depreciation or other tax benefit to which the 1339
utility would otherwise be entitled, and further provided that 1340
such tax benefit as redounds to the utility as a result of such 1341
a computation may not be retained by the company, used to fund 1342
any dividend or distribution, or utilized for any purpose other 1343
than the defrayal of the operating expenses of the utility and 1344

three consecutive twelve-month periods in a single forecasted 1375
test period application. During the first twelve-month period, 1376
the company may propose a reasonably forecasted rate base during 1377
a thirteen-month average, revenues, and expenses for the first 1378
twelve months that new base rates will be in effect. 1379
During the second twelve-month period, the base rate 1380
revenue requirement may be adjusted for the return of, and 1381
return on, incremental rate base additions approved by the 1382
commission in the initial application. During the third twelve- 1383
month period, the base rate revenue requirement may be adjusted 1384
for the return of and return on incremental rate base additions 1385

return that the utility projects to earn on the investments. The 1396
utility shall provide the commission with actual financial 1397
information during the true-up process to ensure accuracy. As 1398
part of the true-up process, the commission shall include only 1399
rate base components that have been found by the commission to 1400
be used and useful in rendering public utility service. 1401

(1) The market-rate offer shall be determined through a 2663
competitive bidding process that provides for all of the 2664
following: 2665
(a) Open, fair, and transparent competitive solicitation; 2666
(b) Clear product definition; 2667
(c) Standardized bid evaluation criteria; 2668

a market-rate offer under division (A) of this section, the 2684
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 93
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
electric distribution utility shall file an application with the 2685
commission. An electric distribution utility may file its 2686
application with the commission prior to the effective date of 2687
the commission rules required under division (A)(2) of this 2688

Section 117:
section, and, as the commission determines necessary, the 2689
utility shall immediately conform its filing to the rules upon 2690
their taking effect. 2691
An application under this division shall detail the 2692
electric distribution utility's proposed compliance with the 2693
requirements of division (A)(1) of this section and with 2694
commission rules under division (A)(2) of this section and 2695
demonstrate that all of the following requirements are met: 2696
(1) The electric distribution utility or its transmission 2697
service affiliate belongs to at least one regional transmission 2698
organization that has been approved by the federal energy 2699
regulatory commission; or there otherwise is comparable and 2700
nondiscriminatory access to the electric transmission grid. 2701
(2) Any such regional transmission organization has a 2702
market-monitor function and the ability to take actions to 2703
identify and mitigate market power or the electric distribution 2704
utility's market conduct; or a similar market monitoring 2705
function exists with commensurate ability to identify and 2706
monitor market conditions and mitigate conduct associated with 2707
the exercise of market power. 2708
(3) A published source of information is available 2709
publicly or through subscription that identifies pricing 2710
information for traded electricity on- and off-peak energy 2711
products that are contracts for delivery beginning at least two 2712
years from the date of the publication and is updated on a 2713
regular basis. 2714
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 94
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
The commission shall initiate a proceeding and, within 2715
ninety days after the application's filing date, shall determine 2716
by order whether the electric distribution utility and its 2717
market-rate offer meet all of the foregoing requirements. If the 2718
finding is positive, the electric distribution utility may shall 2719
initiate its competitive bidding process. If the finding is 2720
negative as to one or more requirements, the commission in the 2721
order shall direct the electric distribution utility regarding 2722
how any deficiency may shall be timely remedied in a timely 2723
manner to the commission's satisfaction; otherwise, the electric 2724
distribution utility shall withdraw the application. However, if 2725
such remedy is made and the subsequent finding is positive and 2726
also if the electric distribution utility made a simultaneous 2727
filing under this section and section 4928.143 of the Revised 2728
Code, the utility shall not initiate its competitive bid until 2729
at least one hundred fifty days after the filing date of those 2730
applications. 2731
(C) Upon the completion of the competitive bidding process 2732
authorized by divisions (A) and (B) of this section, including 2733
for the purpose of division (D) of this section, the commission 2734
shall select the least-cost bid winner or winners of that 2735
process, and such selected bid or bids, as prescribed as retail 2736
rates by the commission, shall be the electric distribution 2737
utility's standard service offer unless the commission, by order 2738
issued before the third calendar day following the conclusion of 2739
the competitive bidding process for the market rate offer, 2740
determines that one or more of the following criteria were not 2741
met: 2742
(1) Each portion of the bidding process was 2743
oversubscribed, such that the amount of supply bid upon was 2744
greater than the amount of the load bid out. 2745
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 95
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
(2) There were four or more bidders. 2746
(3) At least twenty-five per cent of the load is bid upon 2747
by one or more persons other than the electric distribution 2748
utility. 2749
All costs incurred by the electric distribution utility as 2750
a result of or related to the competitive bidding process or to 2751
procuring generation service to provide the standard service 2752
offer, including the costs of energy and capacity and the costs 2753
of all other products and services procured as a result of the 2754
competitive bidding process, shall be timely recovered through 2755
the standard service offer price, and, for that purpose, the 2756
commission shall approve a reconciliation mechanism, other 2757
recovery mechanism, or a combination of such mechanisms for the 2758
utility. 2759
(D) The first application filed under this section by an 2760
electric distribution utility that, as of July 31, 2008, 2761
directly owns, in whole or in part, operating electric 2762
generating facilities that had been used and useful in this 2763
state shall require that a portion of that the utility's 2764
standard service offer load for the first five years of the 2765
market rate offer be competitively bid under division (A) of 2766
this section as follows: ten per cent of the load in year one, 2767
not more than twenty per cent in year two, thirty per cent in 2768
year three, forty per cent in year four, and fifty per cent in 2769
year five. Consistent with those percentages, the commission 2770
shall determine the actual percentages for each year of years 2771
one through five. The standard service offer price for retail 2772
electric generation service under this first application shall 2773
be a proportionate blend of the bid price and the generation 2774
service price for the remaining standard service offer load, 2775
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 96
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
which latter price shall be equal to the electric distribution 2776
utility's most recent standard service offer price, adjusted 2777
upward or downward as the commission determines reasonable, 2778
relative to the jurisdictional portion of any known and 2779
measurable changes from the level of any one or more of the 2780
following costs as reflected in that most recent standard 2781
service offer price: 2782
(1) The electric distribution utility's prudently incurred 2783
cost of fuel used to produce electricity; 2784
(2) Its prudently incurred purchased power costs; 2785
(3) Its prudently incurred costs of satisfying the supply 2786
and demand portfolio requirements of this state, including, but 2787
not limited to, renewable energy resource and energy efficiency 2788
requirements; 2789
(4) Its costs prudently incurred to comply with 2790
environmental laws and regulations, with consideration of the 2791
derating of any facility associated with those costs. 2792
In making any adjustment to the most recent standard 2793
service offer price on the basis of costs described in division 2794
(D) of this section, the commission shall include the benefits 2795
that may become available to the electric distribution utility 2796
as a result of or in connection with the costs included in the 2797
adjustment, including, but not limited to, the utility's receipt 2798
of emissions credits or its receipt of tax benefits or of other 2799
benefits, and, accordingly, the commission may impose such 2800
conditions on the adjustment to ensure that any such benefits 2801
are properly aligned with the associated cost responsibility. 2802
The commission shall also determine how such adjustments will 2803
affect the electric distribution utility's return on common 2804
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 97
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
equity that may be achieved by those adjustments. The commission 2805
shall not apply its consideration of the return on common equity 2806
to reduce any adjustments authorized under this division unless 2807
the adjustments will cause the electric distribution utility to 2808
earn a return on common equity that is significantly in excess 2809
of the return on common equity that is earned by publicly traded 2810
companies, including utilities, that face comparable business 2811
and financial risk, with such adjustments for capital structure 2812
as may be appropriate. The burden of proof for demonstrating 2813
that significantly excessive earnings will not occur shall be on 2814
the electric distribution utility. 2815
Additionally, the commission may adjust the electric 2816
distribution utility's most recent standard service offer price 2817
by such just and reasonable amount that the commission 2818
determines necessary to address any emergency that threatens the 2819
utility's financial integrity or to ensure that the resulting 2820
revenue available to the utility for providing the standard 2821
service offer is not so inadequate as to result, directly or 2822
indirectly, in a taking of property without compensation 2823
pursuant to Section 19 of Article I, Ohio Constitution. The 2824
electric distribution utility has the burden of demonstrating 2825
that any adjustment to its most recent standard service offer 2826
price is proper in accordance with this division. 2827
(E) Beginning in the second year of a blended price under 2828
division (D) of this section and notwithstanding any other 2829
requirement of this section, the commission may alter 2830
prospectively the proportions specified in that division to 2831
mitigate any effect of an abrupt or significant change in the 2832
electric distribution utility's standard service offer price 2833
that would otherwise result in general or with respect to any 2834
rate group or rate schedule but for such alteration. Any such 2835
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 98
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
alteration shall be made not more often than annually, and the 2836
commission shall not, by altering those proportions and in any 2837
event, including because of the length of time, as authorized 2838
under division (C) of this section, taken to approve the market 2839
rate offer, cause the duration of the blending period to exceed 2840
ten years as counted from the effective date of the approved 2841
market rate offer. Additionally, any such alteration shall be 2842
limited to an alteration affecting the prospective proportions 2843
used during the blending period and shall not affect any 2844
blending proportion previously approved and applied by the 2845
commission under this division. 2846
(F) An electric distribution utility that has received 2847
commission approval of its first application under division (C) 2848
of this section shall not, nor ever shall be authorized or 2849
required by the commission to, file an application under section 2850

Section 118:
4928.143 of the Revised Code. 2851
Sec. 4928.144. The public utilities commission by order 2852

4928.141 to 4928.143 and 4928.142 of the Revised Code, and 2855
inclusive of carrying charges, as the commission considers 2856
necessary to ensure rate or price stability for consumers. If 2857
the commission's order includes such a phase-in, the order also 2858
shall provide for the creation of regulatory assets pursuant to 2859
generally accepted accounting principles, by authorizing the 2860
deferral of incurred costs equal to the amount not collected, 2861
plus carrying charges on that amount. Further, the order shall 2862
authorize the collection of those deferrals through a 2863
nonbypassable surcharge on any such rate or price so established 2864
for the electric distribution utility by the commission. 2865

Sec. 4928.1410. If an electric distribution utility has a n 2870
existing electric security plan under which the commission had 2871
authorized the creation or continuation of riders, then, to the 2872
extent those riders will cease to exist after termination of the 2873
electric security plan, the electric distribution utility is 2874
authorized to create necessary regulatory assets or liabilities, 2875
along with carrying costs at the utility's weighted average cost 2876
of debt, for the resolution of any outstanding under-collection 2877
or over-collection of funds under such riders. The resolution of 2878
such regulatory assets or liabilities shall be addressed in the 2879
first distribution rate case under section 4909.18 of the 2880
Revised Code that occurs after the plan's expiration. 2881

businesses of supplying a noncompetitive retail electric service 2887
and supplying a competitive retail electric service, or in the 2888
businesses of supplying a noncompetitive retail electric service 2889
and supplying a product or service other than retail electric 2890
service, unless the utility implements and operates under a 2891
corporate separation plan that is approved by the public 2892

(2) The plan satisfies the public interest in preventing 2905
unfair competitive advantage and preventing the abuse of market 2906
power. 2907
(3) The plan is sufficient to ensure that the utility will 2908
not extend any undue preference or advantage to any affiliate, 2909
division, or part of its own business engaged in the business of 2910
supplying the competitive retail electric service or nonelectric 2911
product or service, including, but not limited to, utility 2912
resources such as trucks, tools, office equipment, office space, 2913
supplies, customer and marketing information, advertising, 2914
billing and mailing systems, personnel, and training, without 2915
compensation based upon fully loaded embedded costs charged to 2916
the affiliate; and to ensure that any such affiliate, division, 2917
or part will not receive undue preference or advantage from any 2918
affiliate, division, or part of the business engaged in business 2919
of supplying the noncompetitive retail electric service. No such 2920
utility, affiliate, division, or part shall extend such undue 2921
preference. Notwithstanding any other division of this section, 2922
a utility's obligation under division (A)(3) of this section 2923
shall be effective January 1, 2000. 2924
(B) The commission may approve, modify and approve, or 2925
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 101
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
disapprove a corporate separation plan filed with the commission 2926
under division (A) of this section. As part of the code of 2927
conduct required under division (A)(1) of this section, the 2928
commission shall adopt rules pursuant to division (A) of section 2929

Section 121:
4928.06 of the Revised Code regarding corporate separation and 2930
procedures for plan filing and approval. The rules shall include 2931
limitations on affiliate practices solely for the purpose of 2932
maintaining a separation of the affiliate's business from the 2933
business of the utility to prevent unfair competitive advantage 2934
abuse of market power by virtue of that relationship. The rules 2935
also shall include an opportunity for any person having a real 2936
and substantial interest in the corporate separation plan to 2937
file specific objections to the plan and propose specific 2938
responses to issues raised in the objections, which objections 2939
and responses the commission shall address in its final order. 2940
Prior to commission approval of the plan, the commission shall 2941
afford a hearing upon those aspects of the plan that the 2942
commission determines reasonably require a hearing. The 2943
commission may reject and require refiling of a substantially 2944
inadequate plan under this section. 2945
(C) The commission shall issue an order approving or 2946
modifying and approving a corporate separation plan under this 2947

Section 122:
section, to be effective on the date specified in the order, 2948
only upon findings that the plan reasonably complies with the 2949
requirements of division (A) of this section and will provide 2950
for ongoing compliance with the policy specified in section 2951

Section 123:
4928.02 of the Revised Code. However, for good cause shown, the 2952
commission may issue an order approving or modifying and 2953
approving a corporate separation plan under this section that 2954
does not comply with division (A)(1) of this section but 2955
complies with such functional separation requirements as the 2956
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 102
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
commission authorizes to apply for an interim period prescribed 2957
in the order, upon a finding that such alternative plan will 2958
provide for ongoing compliance with the policy specified in 2959

Section 124:
section 4928.02 of the Revised Code. 2960
(D) Any party may seek an amendment to a corporate 2961
separation plan approved under this section, and the commission, 2962
pursuant to a request from any party or on its own initiative, 2963
may order as it considers necessary the filing of an amended 2964
corporate separation plan to reflect changed circumstances. 2965
(E) No electric distribution utility shall sell or 2966
transfer any generating asset it wholly or partly owns at any 2967
time without obtaining prior commission approval. 2968
Sec. 4928.20. (A) The legislative authority of a municipal 2969
corporation may adopt an ordinance, or the board of township 2970
trustees of a township or the board of county commissioners of a 2971
county may adopt a resolution, under which, on or after the 2972
starting date of competitive retail electric service, it may 2973
aggregate in accordance with this section the retail electrical 2974
loads located, respectively, within the municipal corporation, 2975
township, or unincorporated area of the county and, for that 2976
purpose, may enter into service agreements to facilitate for 2977
those loads the sale and purchase of electricity. The 2978
legislative authority or board also may exercise such authority 2979
jointly with any other such legislative authority or board. For 2980
customers that are not mercantile customers, an ordinance or 2981
resolution under this division shall specify whether the 2982
aggregation will occur only with the prior, affirmative consent 2983
of each person owning, occupying, controlling, or using an 2984
electric load center proposed to be aggregated or will occur 2985
automatically for all such persons pursuant to the opt-out 2986
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 103
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
requirements of division (D) of this section. The aggregation of 2987
mercantile customers shall occur only with the prior, 2988
affirmative consent of each such person owning, occupying, 2989
controlling, or using an electric load center proposed to be 2990
aggregated. Nothing in this division, however, authorizes the 2991
aggregation of the retail electric loads of an electric load 2992
center, as defined in section 4933.81 of the Revised Code, that 2993
is located in the certified territory of a nonprofit electric 2994
supplier under sections 4933.81 to 4933.90 of the Revised Code 2995
or an electric load center served by transmission or 2996
distribution facilities of a municipal electric utility. 2997
(B) If an ordinance or resolution adopted under division 2998
(A) of this section specifies that aggregation of customers that 2999
are not mercantile customers will occur automatically as 3000
described in that division, the ordinance or resolution shall 3001
direct the board of elections to submit the question of the 3002
authority to aggregate to the electors of the respective 3003
municipal corporation, township, or unincorporated area of a 3004
county at a special election on the day of the next primary or 3005
general election in the municipal corporation, township, or 3006
county. The legislative authority or board shall certify a copy 3007
of the ordinance or resolution to the board of elections not 3008
less than ninety days before the day of the special election. No 3009
ordinance or resolution adopted under division (A) of this 3010

Section 125:
section that provides for an election under this division shall 3011
take effect unless approved by a majority of the electors voting 3012
upon the ordinance or resolution at the election held pursuant 3013
to this division. 3014
(C) Upon the applicable requisite authority under 3015
divisions (A) and (B) of this section, the legislative authority 3016
or board shall develop a plan of operation and governance for 3017
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 104
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
the aggregation program so authorized. Before adopting a plan 3018
under this division, the legislative authority or board shall 3019
hold at least two public hearings on the plan. Before the first 3020
hearing, the legislative authority or board shall publish notice 3021
of the hearings once a week for two consecutive weeks in a 3022
newspaper of general circulation in the jurisdiction or as 3023
provided in section 7.16 of the Revised Code. The notice shall 3024
summarize the plan and state the date, time, and location of 3025
each hearing. 3026
(D) No legislative authority or board, pursuant to an 3027
ordinance or resolution under divisions (A) and (B) of this 3028

Section 126:
section that provides for automatic aggregation of customers 3029
that are not mercantile customers as described in division (A) 3030
of this section, shall aggregate the electrical load of any 3031
electric load center located within its jurisdiction unless it 3032
in advance clearly discloses to the person owning, occupying, 3033
controlling, or using the load center that the person will be 3034
enrolled automatically in the aggregation program and will 3035
remain so enrolled unless the person affirmatively elects by a 3036
stated procedure not to be so enrolled. The disclosure shall 3037
state prominently the rates, charges, and other terms and 3038
conditions of enrollment. The stated procedure shall allow any 3039
person enrolled in the aggregation program the opportunity to 3040
opt out of the program every three years, without paying a 3041
switching fee. Any such person that opts out before the 3042
commencement of the aggregation program pursuant to the stated 3043
procedure shall default to the standard service offer provided 3044
under section 4928.14 or division (D) of section 4928.35 of the 3045
Revised Code until the person chooses an alternative supplier. 3046
(E)(1) With respect to a governmental aggregation for a 3047
municipal corporation that is authorized pursuant to divisions 3048
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 105
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
(A) to (D) of this section, resolutions may be proposed by 3049
initiative or referendum petitions in accordance with sections 3050

Section 127:
731.28 to 731.41 of the Revised Code. 3051
(2) With respect to a governmental aggregation for a 3052
township or the unincorporated area of a county, which 3053
aggregation is authorized pursuant to divisions (A) to (D) of 3054
this section, resolutions may be proposed by initiative or 3055
referendum petitions in accordance with sections 731.28 to 3056

Section 128:
731.40 of the Revised Code, except that: 3057
(a) The petitions shall be filed, respectively, with the 3058
township fiscal officer or the board of county commissioners, 3059
who shall perform those duties imposed under those sections upon 3060
the city auditor or village clerk. 3061
(b) The petitions shall contain the signatures of not less 3062
than ten per cent of the total number of electors in, 3063
respectively, the township or the unincorporated area of the 3064
county who voted for the office of governor at the preceding 3065
general election for that office in that area. 3066
(F) A governmental aggregator under division (A) of this 3067

Section 129:
section is not a public utility engaging in the wholesale 3068
purchase and resale of electricity, and provision of the 3069
aggregated service is not a wholesale utility transaction. A 3070
governmental aggregator shall be subject to supervision and 3071
regulation by the public utilities commission only to the extent 3072
of any competitive retail electric service it provides and 3073
commission authority under this chapter. 3074
(G) This section does not apply in the case of a municipal 3075
corporation that supplies such aggregated service to electric 3076
load centers to which its municipal electric utility also 3077
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 106
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
supplies a noncompetitive retail electric service through 3078
transmission or distribution facilities the utility singly or 3079
jointly owns or operates. 3080
(H) A governmental aggregator shall not include in its 3081
aggregation the accounts of any of the following: 3082
(1) A customer that has opted out of the aggregation; 3083
(2) A customer in contract with a certified electric 3084
services company; 3085
(3) A customer that has a special contract with an 3086
electric distribution utility; 3087
(4) A customer that is not located within the governmental 3088
aggregator's governmental boundaries; 3089
(5) Subject to division (C) of section 4928.21 of the 3090
Revised Code, a customer who appears on the "do not aggregate" 3091
list maintained under that section. 3092
(I) Customers that are part of a governmental aggregation 3093
under this section shall be responsible only for such portion of 3094
a surcharge under section 4928.144 of the Revised Code that is 3095
proportionate to the benefits, as determined by the commission, 3096
that electric load centers within the jurisdiction of the 3097
governmental aggregation as a group receive. The proportionate 3098
surcharge so established shall apply to each customer of the 3099
governmental aggregation while the customer is part of that 3100
aggregation. If a customer ceases being such a customer, the 3101
otherwise applicable surcharge shall apply. Nothing in this 3102

Section 130:
section shall result in less than full recovery by an electric 3103
distribution utility of any surcharge authorized under section 3104

Section 131:
4928.144 of the Revised Code. Nothing in this section shall 3105
result in less than the full and timely imposition, charging, 3106
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 107

collection, and adjustment by an electric distribution utility, 3107
its assignee, or any collection agent, of the phase-in-recovery 3108
charges authorized pursuant to a final financing order issued 3109
pursuant to sections 4928.23 to 4928.2318 of the Revised Code. 3110
(J) On behalf of the customers that are part of a 3111
governmental aggregation under this section and by filing 3112
written notice with the public utilities commission, the 3113
legislative authority that formed or is forming that 3114
governmental aggregation may elect not to receive standby 3115
service within the meaning of division (B)(2)(d) of section 3116

Section 132:
4928.143 of the Revised Code from an electric distribution 3117
utility in whose certified territory the governmental 3118
aggregation is located and that operates under an approved 3119
electric security plan under that section. Upon the filing of 3120
that notice, the electric distribution utility shall not charge 3121
any such customer to whom competitive retail electric generation 3122
service is provided by another supplier under the governmental 3123
aggregation for the standby service. Any such consumer that 3124
returns to the utility for competitive retail electric service 3125
shall pay the market price of power incurred by the utility to 3126
serve that consumer plus any amount attributable to the 3127
utility's cost of compliance with the renewable energy resource 3128
provisions of section 4928.64 of the Revised Code to serve the 3129
consumer. Such market price shall include, but not be limited 3130
to, capacity and energy charges; all charges associated with the 3131
provision of that power supply through the regional transmission 3132
organization, including, but not limited to, transmission, 3133
ancillary services, congestion, and settlement and 3134
administrative charges; and all other costs incurred by the 3135
utility that are associated with the procurement, provision, and 3136
administration of that power supply, as such costs may be 3137
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 108
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
approved by the commission. The period of time during which the 3138
market price and renewable energy resource amount shall be so 3139
assessed on the consumer shall be from the time the consumer so 3140
returns to the electric distribution utility until the 3141
expiration of the electric security plan. However, if that 3142
period of time is expected to be more than two years, the 3143
commission may reduce the time period to a period of not less 3144
than two years. 3145
(K) The commission shall adopt rules and issue orders in 3146
proceedings under sections 4928.141 and 4928.142 of the Revised 3147
Code to encourage and promote large-scale governmental 3148
aggregation in this state. For that purpose, the commission 3149
shall conduct an immediate review of any rules it has adopted 3150
for the purpose of this section that are in effect on the 3151
effective date of the amendment of this section by S.B. 221 of 3152
the 127th general assembly, July 31, 2008. Further, within the 3153
context of an electric security plan under section 4928.143 of 3154
the Revised Code, as that section existed prior to its repeal by 3155
this act, or a market rate offer under section 4928.142 of the 3156
Revised Code, as amended by this act, the commission shall 3157
consider the effect on large-scale governmental aggregation of 3158
any nonbypassable generation charges, however collected, under 3159
that plan, or that would be established under that planoffer, 3160
except any nonbypassable generation charges that relate to any 3161
cost incurred by the electric distribution utility, the deferral 3162
of which has been authorized by the commission prior to the 3163
effective date of the amendment of this section by S.B. 221 of 3164
the 127th general assembly, July 31, 2008. 3165

Sec. 4928.34. (A) The public utilities commission shall 3460
not approve or prescribe a transition plan under division (A) or 3461
(B) of section 4928.33 of the Revised Code unless the commission 3462
first makes all of the following determinations: 3463
(1) The unbundled components for the electric transmission 3464
component of retail electric service, as specified in the 3465
utility's rate unbundling plan required by division (A)(1) of 3466

Section 148:
section 4928.31 of the Revised Code, equal the tariff rates 3467
determined by the federal energy regulatory commission that are 3468
in effect on the date of the approval of the transition plan 3469
under sections 4928.31 to 4928.40 of the Revised Code, as each 3470
such rate is determined applicable to each particular customer 3471
class and rate schedule by the commission. The unbundled 3472
transmission component shall include a sliding scale of charges 3473
under division (B) of section 4905.31 of the Revised Code to 3474
ensure that refunds determined or approved by the federal energy 3475
regulatory commission are flowed through to retail electric 3476
customers. 3477
(2) The unbundled components for retail electric 3478
distribution service in the rate unbundling plan equal the 3479
difference between the costs attributable to the utility's 3480
transmission and distribution rates and charges under its 3481
schedule of rates and charges in effect on the effective date of 3482
this section, based upon the record in the most recent rate 3483
proceeding of the utility for which the utility's schedule was 3484
established, and the tariff rates for electric transmission 3485
service determined by the federal energy regulatory commission 3486
as described in division (A)(1) of this section. 3487
(3) All other unbundled components required by the 3488
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 120
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
commission in the rate unbundling plan equal the costs 3489
attributable to the particular service as reflected in the 3490
utility's schedule of rates and charges in effect on the 3491
effective date of this section. 3492
(4) The unbundled components for retail electric 3493
generation service in the rate unbundling plan equal the 3494
residual amount remaining after the determination of the 3495
transmission, distribution, and other unbundled components, and 3496
after any adjustments necessary to reflect the effects of the 3497
amendment of section 5727.111 of the Revised Code by Sub. S.B. 3498
No. 3 of the 123rd general assembly. 3499
(5) All unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan 3500
have been adjusted to reflect any base rate reductions on file 3501
with the commission and as scheduled to be in effect by December 3502
31, 2005, under rate settlements in effect on the effective date 3503
of this section. However, all earnings obligations, 3504
restrictions, or caps imposed on an electric utility in a 3505
commission order prior to the effective date of this section are 3506
void. 3507
(6) Subject to division (A)(5) of this section, the total 3508
of all unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan are 3509
capped and shall equal during the market development period, 3510
except as specifically provided in this chapter, the total of 3511
all rates and charges in effect under the applicable bundled 3512
schedule of the electric utility pursuant to section 4905.30 of 3513
the Revised Code in effect on the day before the effective date 3514
of this section, including the transition charge determined 3515
under section 4928.40 of the Revised Code, adjusted for any 3516
changes in the taxation of electric utilities and retail 3517
electric service under Sub. S.B. No. 3 of the 123rd General 3518

Assembly, the universal service rider authorized by section 3519

Section 149:
4928.51 of the Revised Code, and the temporary rider authorized 3520
by section 4928.61 of the Revised Code. For the purpose of this 3521
division, the rate cap applicable to a customer receiving 3522
electric service pursuant to an arrangement approved by the 3523
commission under section 4905.31 of the Revised Code is, for the 3524
term of the arrangement, the total of all rates and charges in 3525
effect under the arrangement. For any rate schedule filed 3526
pursuant to section 4905.30 of the Revised Code or any 3527
arrangement subject to approval pursuant to section 4905.31 of 3528
the Revised Code, the initial tax-related adjustment to the rate 3529
cap required by this division shall be equal to the rate of 3530
taxation specified in section 5727.81 of the Revised Code and 3531
applicable to the schedule or arrangement. To the extent such 3532
total annual amount of the tax-related adjustment is greater 3533
than or less than the comparable amount of the total annual tax 3534
reduction experienced by the electric utility as a result of the 3535
provisions of Sub. S.B. No. 3 of the 123rd general assembly, 3536
such difference shall be addressed by the commission through 3537
accounting procedures, refunds, or an annual surcharge or credit 3538
to customers, or through other appropriate means, to avoid 3539
placing the financial responsibility for the difference upon the 3540
electric utility or its shareholders. Any adjustments in the 3541
rate of taxation specified in section 5727.81 of the Revised 3542
Code section shall not occur without a corresponding adjustment 3543
to the rate cap for each such rate schedule or arrangement. The 3544
department of taxation shall advise the commission and self- 3545
assessors under section 5727.81 of the Revised Code prior to the 3546
effective date of any change in the rate of taxation specified 3547
under that section, and the commission shall modify the rate cap 3548
to reflect that adjustment so that the rate cap adjustment is 3549
effective as of the effective date of the change in the rate of 3550
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 122

commission under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the Revised 3562
Code. 3563
(9) Any plan or plans the commission requires to address 3564
operational support systems and any other technical 3565
implementation issues pertaining to competitive retail electric 3566
service comply with any rules adopted by the commission under 3567
division (A) of section 4928.06 of the Revised Code. 3568
(10) The employee assistance plan required by division (A) 3569
(4) of section 4928.31 of the Revised Code sufficiently provides 3570
severance, retraining, early retirement, retention, 3571
outplacement, and other assistance for the utility's employees 3572
whose employment is affected by electric industry restructuring 3573
under this chapter. 3574
(11) The consumer education plan required under division 3575
(A)(5) of section 4928.31 of the Revised Code complies with 3576
former section 4928.42 of the Revised Code and any rules adopted 3577

any rules adopted by the commission under division (A) of 3591

Section 153:
section 4928.06 of the Revised Code, unless the commission, for 3592
good cause shown, authorizes the utility to defer compliance 3593
until an order is issued under division (G) of section 4928.35 3594
of the Revised Code. 3595
(14) The utility is in compliance with sections 4928.01 to 3596

Section 154:
4928.11 of the Revised Code and any rules or orders of the 3597
commission adopted or issued under those sections. 3598
(15) All unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan 3599
have been adjusted to reflect the elimination of the tax on 3600
gross receipts imposed by section 5727.30 of the Revised Code. 3601
In addition, a transition plan approved by the commission 3602
under section 4928.33 of the Revised Code but not containing an 3603
approved independent transmission plan shall contain the express 3604
conditions that the utility will comply with an order issued 3605
under division (G) of section 4928.35 of the Revised Code. 3606

of this section and, in the course of that review, shall 3695
identify any undercompliance or noncompliance of the utility or 3696
company that it determines is weather-related, related to 3697
equipment or resource shortages for qualifying renewable energy 3698
resources as applicable, or is otherwise outside the utility's 3699
or company's control. 3700
(2) Subject to the cost cap provisions of division (C)(3) 3701
of this section, if the commission determines, after notice and 3702
opportunity for hearing, and based upon its findings in that 3703
review regarding avoidable undercompliance or noncompliance, but 3704
subject to division (C)(4) of this section, that the utility or 3705
company has failed to comply with any such benchmark, the 3706
commission shall impose a renewable energy compliance payment on 3707
the utility or company. 3708
(a) The compliance payment pertaining to the solar energy 3709
resource benchmarks under division (B)(2) of this section shall 3710
be an amount per megawatt hour of undercompliance or 3711
noncompliance in the period under review, as follows: 3712
(i) Three hundred dollars for 2014, 2015, and 2016; 3713
(ii) Two hundred fifty dollars for 2017 and 2018; 3714
(iii) Two hundred dollars for 2019. 3715
(b) The compliance payment pertaining to the renewable 3716
energy resource benchmarks under division (B)(2) of this section 3717
shall equal the number of additional renewable energy credits 3718
that the electric distribution utility or electric services 3719
company would have needed to comply with the applicable 3720
benchmark in the period under review times an amount that shall 3721
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 129
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
begin at forty-five dollars and shall be adjusted annually by 3722
the commission to reflect any change in the consumer price index 3723
as defined in section 101.27 of the Revised Code, but shall not 3724
be less than forty-five dollars. As used in this division, 3725
"consumer price index" means the consumer price index prepared 3726
by the United States bureau of labor statistics (U.S. city 3727
average for urban wage earners and clerical workers: all items, 3728
1982-1984=100), or, if that index is no longer published, a 3729
generally available comparable index. 3730
(c) The compliance payment shall not be passed through by 3731
the electric distribution utility or electric services company 3732
to consumers. The compliance payment shall be remitted to the 3733
commission, for deposit to the credit of the advanced energy 3734
fund created under section 4928.61 of the Revised Code. Payment 3735
of the compliance payment shall be subject to such collection 3736
and enforcement procedures as apply to the collection of a 3737
forfeiture under sections 4905.55 to 4905.60 and 4905.64 of the 3738
Revised Code. 3739
(3) An electric distribution utility or an electric 3740
services company need not comply with a benchmark under division 3741
(B)(2) of this section to the extent that its reasonably 3742
expected cost of that compliance exceeds its reasonably expected 3743
cost of otherwise producing or acquiring the requisite 3744
electricity by three per cent or more. The cost of compliance 3745
shall be calculated as though any exemption from taxes and 3746
assessments had not been granted under section 5727.75 of the 3747
Revised Code. 3748
(4)(a) An electric distribution utility or electric 3749
services company may request the commission to make a force 3750
majeure determination pursuant to this division regarding all or 3751
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 130
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
part of the utility's or company's compliance with any minimum 3752
benchmark under division (B)(2) of this section during the 3753
period of review occurring pursuant to division (C)(2) of this 3754

Section 159:
section. The commission may require the electric distribution 3755
utility or electric services company to make solicitations for 3756
renewable energy resource credits as part of its default service 3757
before the utility's or company's request of force majeure under 3758
this division can be made. 3759
(b) Within ninety days after the filing of a request by an 3760
electric distribution utility or electric services company under 3761
division (C)(4)(a) of this section, the commission shall 3762
determine if qualifying renewable energy resources are 3763
reasonably available in the marketplace in sufficient quantities 3764
for the utility or company to comply with the subject minimum 3765
benchmark during the review period. In making this 3766
determination, the commission shall consider whether the 3767
electric distribution utility or electric services company has 3768
made a good faith effort to acquire sufficient qualifying 3769
renewable energy or, as applicable, solar energy resources to so 3770
comply, including, but not limited to, by banking or seeking 3771
renewable energy resource credits or by seeking the resources 3772
through long-term contracts. Additionally, the commission shall 3773
consider the availability of qualifying renewable energy or 3774
solar energy resources in this state and other jurisdictions in 3775
the PJM interconnection regional transmission organization, 3776
L.L.C., or its successor and the midcontinent independent system 3777
operator or its successor. 3778
(c) If, pursuant to division (C)(4)(b) of this section, 3779
the commission determines that qualifying renewable energy or 3780
solar energy resources are not reasonably available to permit 3781
the electric distribution utility or electric services company 3782
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 131
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
to comply, during the period of review, with the subject minimum 3783
benchmark prescribed under division (B)(2) of this section, the 3784
commission shall modify that compliance obligation of the 3785
utility or company as it determines appropriate to accommodate 3786
the finding. Commission modification shall not automatically 3787
reduce the obligation for the electric distribution utility's or 3788
electric services company's compliance in subsequent years. If 3789
it modifies the electric distribution utility or electric 3790
services company obligation under division (C)(4)(c) of this 3791

Section 160:
section, the commission may require the utility or company, if 3792
sufficient renewable energy resource credits exist in the 3793
marketplace, to acquire additional renewable energy resource 3794
credits in subsequent years equivalent to the utility's or 3795
company's modified obligation under division (C)(4)(c) of this 3796

Section 161:
section. 3797
(5) The commission shall establish a process to provide 3798
for at least an annual review of the renewable energy resource 3799
market in this state and in the service territories of the 3800
regional transmission organizations that manage transmission 3801
systems located in this state. The commission shall use the 3802
results of this study to identify any needed changes to the 3803
amount of the renewable energy compliance payment specified 3804
under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of this section. Specifically, 3805
the commission may increase the amount to ensure that payment of 3806
compliance payments is not used to achieve compliance with this 3807

Section 162:
section in lieu of actually acquiring or realizing energy 3808
derived from qualifying renewable energy resources. However, if 3809
the commission finds that the amount of the compliance payment 3810
should be otherwise changed, the commission shall present this 3811
finding to the general assembly for legislative enactment. 3812
(D) The commission annually shall submit to the general 3813
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 132
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
assembly in accordance with section 101.68 of the Revised Code a 3814
report describing all of the following: 3815
(1) The compliance of electric distribution utilities and 3816
electric services companies with division (B) of this section; 3817
(2) The average annual cost of renewable energy credits 3818
purchased by utilities and companies for the year covered in the 3819
report; 3820
(3) Any strategy for utility and company compliance or for 3821
encouraging the use of qualifying renewable energy resources in 3822
supplying this state's electricity needs in a manner that 3823
considers available technology, costs, job creation, and 3824
economic impacts. 3825
The commission shall begin providing the information 3826
described in division (D)(2) of this section in each report 3827
submitted after September 10, 2012. The commission shall allow 3828
and consider public comments on the report prior to its 3829
submission to the general assembly. Nothing in the report shall 3830
be binding on any person, including any utility or company for 3831
the purpose of its compliance with any benchmark under division 3832
(B) of this section, or the enforcement of that provision under 3833
division (C) of this section. 3834
(E) All costs incurred by an electric distribution utility 3835
in complying with the requirements of this section shall be 3836
bypassable by any consumer that has exercised choice of supplier 3837
under section 4928.03 of the Revised Code. 3838
Sec. 4928.645. (A) An electric distribution utility or 3839
electric services company may use, for the purpose of complying 3840
with the requirements under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of section 3841

Section 163:
4928.64 of the Revised Code, renewable energy credits any time 3842
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 133
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
in the five calendar years following the date of their purchase 3843
or acquisition from any entity, including, but not limited to, 3844
the following: 3845
(1) A mercantile customer; 3846
(2) An owner or operator of a hydroelectric generating 3847
facility that is located at a dam on a river, or on any water 3848
discharged to a river, that is within or bordering this state or 3849
within or bordering an adjoining state, or that produces power 3850
that can be shown to be deliverable into this state; 3851
(3) A seller of compressed natural gas that has been 3852
produced from biologically derived methane gas, provided that 3853
the seller may only provide renewable energy credits for metered 3854
amounts of gas. 3855
(B)(1) The public utilities commission shall adopt rules 3856
specifying that one unit of credit shall equal one megawatt hour 3857
of electricity derived from renewable energy resources, except 3858
that, for a generating facility of seventy-five megawatts or 3859
greater that is situated within this state and has committed by 3860
December 31, 2009, to modify or retrofit its generating unit or 3861
units to enable the facility to generate principally from 3862
biomass energy by June 30, 2013, each megawatt hour of 3863
electricity generated principally from that biomass energy shall 3864
equal, in units of credit, the product obtained by multiplying 3865
the actual percentage of biomass feedstock heat input used to 3866
generate such megawatt hour by the quotient obtained by dividing 3867
the then existing unit dollar amount used to determine a 3868
renewable energy compliance payment as provided under division 3869
(C)(2)(b) of section 4928.64 of the Revised Code by the then 3870
existing market value of one renewable energy credit, but such 3871
megawatt hour shall not equal less than one unit of credit. 3872
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 134
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
Renewable energy resources do not have to be converted to 3873
electricity in order to be eligible to receive renewable energy 3874
credits. The rules shall specify that, for purposes of 3875
converting the quantity of energy derived from biologically 3876
derived methane gas to an electricity equivalent, one megawatt 3877
hour equals 3,412,142 British thermal units. 3878
(2) The rules also shall provide for this state a system 3879
of registering renewable energy credits by specifying which of 3880
any generally available registries shall be used for that 3881
purpose and not by creating a registry. That selected system of 3882
registering renewable energy credits shall allow a hydroelectric 3883
generating facility to be eligible for obtaining renewable 3884
energy credits and shall allow customer-sited projects or 3885
actions the broadest opportunities to be eligible for obtaining 3886
renewable energy credits. 3887
(C) Beginning January 1, 2020, a qualifying solar resource 3888
as defined in section 3706.40 of the Revised Code is not 3889
eligible to obtain a renewable energy credit under this section 3890
for any megawatt hour for which the resource has been issued a 3891
solar energy credit under section 3706.45 of the Revised Code. 3892
(D) Except for compressed natural gas that has been 3893
produced from biologically derived methane gas, energy generated 3894
by using natural gas as a resource is not eligible to obtain a 3895
renewable energy credit under this section. 3896
Sec. 4928.73. (A) As used in this section : 3897
(1) "Mercantile customer member" means a mercantile 3898
customer connected to a mercantile customer self-power system. 3899

mercantile customer member or a group of mercantile customer 3905
members; 3906
(b) Connect directly to the mercantile customer member's 3907
side of the electric meter; 3908
(c) Deliver electricity to the mercantile customer 3909
member's side of the electric meter without the use of an 3910
electric distribution utility's or an electric cooperative's 3911
distribution system or transmission system; 3912
(d) Is located on either of the following: 3913
(i) A property owned or controlled by a mercantile 3914
customer member or the entity that owns or operates the 3915
mercantile customer self-power system, provided that the 3916
property is not located more than one mile from the customer or 3917
group of customers that consume the electricity produced by the 3918
facilities; 3919
(ii) Land adjacent to a mercantile customer member if the 3920
facilities connect directly with the customer. 3921
(B) The mercantile customer self-power system may be owned 3922
or operated by a mercantile customer member, group of mercantile 3923
customer members, or an entity that is not a mercantile customer 3924
member. 3925
(C) A mercantile customer self-power system may provide 3926
electric generation service to one or more mercantile customers. 3927
(D) The public utilities commission shall adopt rules to 3928
implement this section that are applicable to electric 3929
Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 136
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
distribution utilities. 3930
(E) Nothing in this section prohibits an electric 3931
distribution utility or an electric cooperative from charging a 3932
mercantile customer for distribution or transmission service 3933
used by a mercantile customer. 3934
Sec. 4929.20. (A)(A)(1) No governmental aggregator as 3935
defined in division (K)(1) of section 4929.01 of the Revised 3936

compliance with section 4929.22 of the Revised Code and with the 3969
minimum service requirements established under section 4929.23 3970
of the Revised Code. The standards shall allow flexibility for 3971
voluntary aggregation, to encourage market creativity in 3972
responding to consumer needs and demands. The rules shall 3973
include procedures for biennially renewing certification. 3974
(C)(1) The commission may suspend, rescind, or 3975
conditionally rescind the certification of any retail natural 3976
gas supplier or governmental aggregator issued under this 3977

Section 164:
section if the commission determines, after reasonable notice 3978
and opportunity for hearing, that the retail natural gas 3979
supplier or governmental aggregator has failed to comply with 3980
any applicable certification standards prescribed in rules 3981
adopted pursuant to this section or section 4929.22 of the 3982
Revised Code. 3983
(2) An affected natural gas company may file an 3984
application with the commission for approval of authority to 3985
recover in accordance with division (C)(2) of this section 3986
incremental costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the 3987
company in connection with the commission's continuation, 3988

Code, a rule or order adopted or issued by the commission under 3998
Chapter 4905. of the Revised Code, or an exemption granted by 3999
the commission under sections 4929.04 to 4929.08 of the Revised 4000
Code. The rider shall take effect ninety days after the date of 4001
the application's filing unless the commission, based on the 4002
audit results and for good cause shown, sets the matter for 4003
hearing. After the hearing, the commission shall approve the 4004
application, and authorize such cost recovery rider effective on 4005
the date specified in the order, only for such incremental costs 4006
as the commission determines were reasonably and prudently 4007
incurred by the company in connection with the continuation, 4008
suspension, rescission, or conditional rescission of a retail 4009
natural gas supplier's certification under division (C)(1) of 4010
this section. Any proceeding under division (C)(2) of this 4011

Revised Code to be assessed by the tax commissioner shall be 4458
determined by a method of valuation using cost as capitalized on 4459
the public utility's books and records less composite annual 4460

property of an electric company or a rural electric company, 4508
excluding transmission and distribution property, first placed 4509

public utility includes amounts capitalized that represent 4526
regulatory assets, if such amounts previously were included on 4527

Sec. 4909.15. (A) The public utilities commission, when 1221

projected to be used and useful as of the date certain, in 1231
rendering the public utility service for which rates are to be 1232
fixed and determined. The 1233
(b) With respect to an electric light company that chooses 1234
to file a forecasted test period under section 4909.18 of the 1235
Revised Code, the valuation of the property of the utility that 1236
is projected to be used and useful during the forecasted test 1237
period in rendering the public utility service for which rates 1238
are to be fixed and determined. 1239
(c) The valuation so determined under division (A)(1) of 1240
this section for any public utility shall be the total value as 1241
set forth in division (C)(9)(B)(8) of section 4909.042 of the 1242
Revised Code and division (B)(9) of section 4909.05 of the 1243

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 44
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
Revised Code, and a reasonable allowance for materials and 1244
supplies and a reasonable allowance for cash working capital as 1245
determined by the commission. 1246
The commission, in its discretion, may include in the 1247
valuation a reasonable allowance for construction work in 1248
progress but, in no event, may such an allowance be made by the 1249
commission until it has determined that the particular 1250
construction project is at least seventy-five per cent complete. 1251
In determining the percentage completion of a particular 1252
construction project, the commission shall consider, among other 1253
relevant criteria, the per cent of time elapsed in construction; 1254
the per cent of construction funds, excluding allowance for 1255
funds used during construction, expended, or obligated to such 1256
construction funds budgeted where all such funds are adjusted to 1257
reflect current purchasing power; and any physical inspection 1258
performed by or on behalf of any party, including the 1259
commission's staff. 1260
A reasonable allowance for construction work in progress 1261
shall not exceed ten per cent of the total valuation as stated 1262
in this division, not including such allowance for construction 1263
work in progress. 1264
Where the commission permits an allowance for construction 1265
work in progress, the dollar value of the project or portion 1266
thereof included in the valuation as construction work in 1267
progress shall not be included in the valuation as plant in 1268
service until such time as the total revenue effect of the 1269
construction work in progress allowance is offset by the total 1270
revenue effect of the plant in service exclusion. Carrying 1271
charges calculated in a manner similar to allowance for funds 1272
used during construction shall accrue on that portion of the 1273

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 45
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
project in service but not reflected in rates as plant in 1274
service, and such accrued carrying charges shall be included in 1275
the valuation of the property at the conclusion of the offset 1276
period for purposes of division (C)(9) of section 4909.05 of the 1277
Revised Code. 1278
From and after April 10, 1985, no allowance for 1279
construction work in progress as it relates to a particular 1280
construction project shall be reflected in rates for a period 1281
exceeding forty-eight consecutive months commencing on the date 1282
the initial rates reflecting such allowance become effective, 1283
except as otherwise provided in this division. 1284
The applicable maximum period in rates for an allowance 1285
for construction work in progress as it relates to a particular 1286
construction project shall be tolled if, and to the extent, a 1287
delay in the in-service date of the project is caused by the 1288
action or inaction of any federal, state, county, or municipal 1289
agency having jurisdiction, where such action or inaction 1290
relates to a change in a rule, standard, or approval of such 1291
agency, and where such action or inaction is not the result of 1292
the failure of the utility to reasonably endeavor to comply with 1293
any rule, standard, or approval prior to such change. 1294
In the event that such period expires before the project 1295
goes into service, the commission shall exclude, from the date 1296
of expiration, the allowance for the project as construction 1297
work in progress from rates, except that the commission may 1298
extend the expiration date up to twelve months for good cause 1299
shown. 1300
In the event that a utility has permanently canceled, 1301
abandoned, or terminated construction of a project for which it 1302
was previously permitted a construction work in progress 1303

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 46
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
allowance, the commission immediately shall exclude the 1304
allowance for the project from the valuation. 1305
In the event that a construction work in progress project 1306
previously included in the valuation is removed from the 1307
valuation pursuant to this division, any revenues collected by 1308
the utility from its customers after April 10, 1985, that 1309
resulted from such prior inclusion shall be offset against 1310
future revenues over the same period of time as the project was 1311
included in the valuation as construction work in progress. The 1312
total revenue effect of such offset shall not exceed the total 1313
revenues previously collected. 1314

commission finds, after reasonable notice and opportunity for 2580
hearing, that any of the following conditions are met: 2581
(A) (1) The supplier has defaulted on its contracts with 2582
customers, is in receivership, or has filed for bankruptcy. 2583
(B) (2) The supplier is no longer capable of providing the 2584
service. 2585
(C) (3) The supplier is unable to provide delivery to 2586
transmission or distribution facilities for such period of time 2587
as may be reasonably specified by commission rule adopted under 2588
division (A) of section 4928.06 of the Revised Code. 2589
(D) (4) The supplier's certification has been suspended, 2590
conditionally rescinded, or rescinded under division (D) of 2591
section 4928.08 of the Revised Code. 2592
(C) If an electric distribution utility has an electric 2593
security plan that was approved under section 4928.143 of the 2594
Revised Code as that section existed prior to the amendments to 2595

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 90
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
this section by this act, the failure of a supplier to provide 2596
retail electric generation service to customers within the 2597
certified territory of that utility shall result in the 2598
supplier's customers, after reasonable notice, defaulting to the 2599
utility's standard service offer under that electric security 2600
plan until the customer chooses an alternative supplier or until 2601
the utility's standard service offer is authorized under section 2602
4928.142 of the Revised Code. 2603
Sec. 4928.141. (A) Beginning January 1, 2009, an (A)(1) An 2604
electric distribution utility shall provide consumers, on a 2605
comparable and nondiscriminatory basis within its certified 2606
territory, a standard service offer of all competitive retail 2607
electric services necessary to maintain essential electric 2608
service to consumers, including a firm supply of electric 2609
generation service. To that end, the electric distribution 2610
utility shall apply to the public utilities commission to 2611
establish the standard service offer in accordance with section 2612
4928.142 or 4928.143 of the Revised Code and, at its discretion, 2613
may apply simultaneously under both sections, except that the 2614
utility's first standard service offer application at minimum 2615
shall include a filing under section 4928.143 of the Revised 2616
Code. Only Except as provided in division (A)(2) of this 2617
section, a standard service offer authorized in accordance with 2618
section 4928.142 or 4928.143 of the Revised Code, shall serve as 2619
the utility's standard service offer for the purpose of 2620
compliance with this section;, and that standard service offer 2621
shall serve as the utility's default standard service offer for 2622
the purpose of section 4928.14 of the Revised Code. 2623
Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, the rate 2624
(2) An electric distribution utility's electric security 2625
plan of an electric distribution utility that was approved under 2626

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 91
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
section 4928.143 of the Revised Code as that section existed 2627
prior to the amendments to this section by this act shall 2628
continue for the purpose of the utility's compliance with this 2629
division (A)(1) of this section until a standard service offer 2630
is first authorized to be effective under section 4928.142 or 2631
4928.143 of the Revised Code, and, as applicable, pursuant to 2632
division (D) of section 4928.143 of the Revised Code, any rate . 2633
Each security plan that extends approved before the effective 2634
date of the amendments to this section by this act shall extend 2635
beyond December 31, 2008, shall continue to be in effect for the 2636
subject electric distribution utility for the duration of the 2637
plan's termthrough the final standard service offer auction 2638
delivery period approved by the public utilities commission 2639
under the plan as of the effective date of the amendments to 2640
this section by this act and thereafter shall terminate. 2641
(3) A standard service offer under section 4928.142 or 2642
4928.143 of the Revised Code shall exclude any previously 2643
authorized allowances for transition costs, with such exclusion 2644
being effective on and after the date that the allowance is 2645
scheduled to end under the utility's rate electric security 2646
plan. 2647
(B) The commission shall set the time for hearing of a 2648
filing under section 4928.142 or 4928.143 of the Revised Code, 2649
send written notice of the hearing to the electric distribution 2650
utility, and publish notice in a newspaper of general 2651
circulation in each county in the utility's certified territory. 2652
The commission shall adopt rules regarding filings under those 2653
sections the section. 2654
Sec. 4928.142. (A) For the purpose of complying with 2655
section 4928.141 of the Revised Code and subject to division (D) 2656

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 92
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
of this section and, as applicable, subject to the rate plan 2657
requirement requirements of division (A) of section 4928.141 of 2658
the Revised Code, an electric distribution utility may shall 2659
establish a standard service offer price for retail electric 2660
generation service that is delivered to the utility under a 2661
market-rate offer. 2662
(1) The market-rate offer shall be determined through a 2663
competitive bidding process that provides for all of the 2664
following: 2665
(a) Open, fair, and transparent competitive solicitation; 2666
(b) Clear product definition; 2667
(c) Standardized bid evaluation criteria; 2668
(d) Oversight by an independent third party that shall 2669
design the solicitation, administer the bidding, and ensure that 2670
the criteria specified in division divisions (A)(1)(a) to (c) of 2671
this section are met; 2672
(e) Evaluation of the submitted bids prior to the 2673
selection of the least-cost bid winner or winners. 2674
No generation supplier shall be prohibited from 2675
participating in the bidding process. 2676
(2) The public utilities commission shall modify rules, or 2677
adopt new rules as necessary, concerning the conduct of the 2678
competitive bidding process and the qualifications of bidders, 2679
which rules shall foster supplier participation in the bidding 2680
process and shall be consistent with the requirements of 2681
division (A)(1) of this section. 2682
(B) Prior to initiating a competitive bidding process for 2683
a market-rate offer under division (A) of this section, the 2684

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 93
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
electric distribution utility shall file an application with the 2685
commission. An electric distribution utility may file its 2686
application with the commission prior to the effective date of 2687
the commission rules required under division (A)(2) of this 2688
section, and, as the commission determines necessary, the 2689
utility shall immediately conform its filing to the rules upon 2690
their taking effect. 2691
An application under this division shall detail the 2692
electric distribution utility's proposed compliance with the 2693
requirements of division (A)(1) of this section and with 2694
commission rules under division (A)(2) of this section and 2695
demonstrate that all of the following requirements are met: 2696
(1) The electric distribution utility or its transmission 2697
service affiliate belongs to at least one regional transmission 2698
organization that has been approved by the federal energy 2699
regulatory commission; or there otherwise is comparable and 2700
nondiscriminatory access to the electric transmission grid. 2701
(2) Any such regional transmission organization has a 2702
market-monitor function and the ability to take actions to 2703
identify and mitigate market power or the electric distribution 2704
utility's market conduct; or a similar market monitoring 2705
function exists with commensurate ability to identify and 2706
monitor market conditions and mitigate conduct associated with 2707
the exercise of market power. 2708
(3) A published source of information is available 2709
publicly or through subscription that identifies pricing 2710
information for traded electricity on- and off-peak energy 2711
products that are contracts for delivery beginning at least two 2712
years from the date of the publication and is updated on a 2713
regular basis. 2714

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 94
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
The commission shall initiate a proceeding and, within 2715
ninety days after the application's filing date, shall determine 2716
by order whether the electric distribution utility and its 2717
market-rate offer meet all of the foregoing requirements. If the 2718
finding is positive, the electric distribution utility may shall 2719
initiate its competitive bidding process. If the finding is 2720
negative as to one or more requirements, the commission in the 2721
order shall direct the electric distribution utility regarding 2722
how any deficiency may shall be timely remedied in a timely 2723
manner to the commission's satisfaction; otherwise, the electric 2724
distribution utility shall withdraw the application. However, if 2725
such remedy is made and the subsequent finding is positive and 2726
also if the electric distribution utility made a simultaneous 2727
filing under this section and section 4928.143 of the Revised 2728
Code, the utility shall not initiate its competitive bid until 2729
at least one hundred fifty days after the filing date of those 2730
applications. 2731
(C) Upon the completion of the competitive bidding process 2732
authorized by divisions (A) and (B) of this section, including 2733
for the purpose of division (D) of this section, the commission 2734
shall select the least-cost bid winner or winners of that 2735
process, and such selected bid or bids, as prescribed as retail 2736
rates by the commission, shall be the electric distribution 2737
utility's standard service offer unless the commission, by order 2738
issued before the third calendar day following the conclusion of 2739
the competitive bidding process for the market rate offer, 2740
determines that one or more of the following criteria were not 2741
met: 2742
(1) Each portion of the bidding process was 2743
oversubscribed, such that the amount of supply bid upon was 2744
greater than the amount of the load bid out. 2745

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 95
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
(2) There were four or more bidders. 2746
(3) At least twenty-five per cent of the load is bid upon 2747
by one or more persons other than the electric distribution 2748
utility. 2749
All costs incurred by the electric distribution utility as 2750
a result of or related to the competitive bidding process or to 2751
procuring generation service to provide the standard service 2752
offer, including the costs of energy and capacity and the costs 2753
of all other products and services procured as a result of the 2754
competitive bidding process, shall be timely recovered through 2755
the standard service offer price, and, for that purpose, the 2756
commission shall approve a reconciliation mechanism, other 2757
recovery mechanism, or a combination of such mechanisms for the 2758
utility. 2759
(D) The first application filed under this section by an 2760
electric distribution utility that, as of July 31, 2008, 2761
directly owns, in whole or in part, operating electric 2762
generating facilities that had been used and useful in this 2763
state shall require that a portion of that the utility's 2764
standard service offer load for the first five years of the 2765
market rate offer be competitively bid under division (A) of 2766
this section as follows: ten per cent of the load in year one, 2767
not more than twenty per cent in year two, thirty per cent in 2768
year three, forty per cent in year four, and fifty per cent in 2769
year five. Consistent with those percentages, the commission 2770
shall determine the actual percentages for each year of years 2771
one through five. The standard service offer price for retail 2772
electric generation service under this first application shall 2773
be a proportionate blend of the bid price and the generation 2774
service price for the remaining standard service offer load, 2775

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 96
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
which latter price shall be equal to the electric distribution 2776
utility's most recent standard service offer price, adjusted 2777
upward or downward as the commission determines reasonable, 2778
relative to the jurisdictional portion of any known and 2779
measurable changes from the level of any one or more of the 2780
following costs as reflected in that most recent standard 2781
service offer price: 2782
(1) The electric distribution utility's prudently incurred 2783
cost of fuel used to produce electricity; 2784
(2) Its prudently incurred purchased power costs; 2785
(3) Its prudently incurred costs of satisfying the supply 2786
and demand portfolio requirements of this state, including, but 2787
not limited to, renewable energy resource and energy efficiency 2788
requirements; 2789
(4) Its costs prudently incurred to comply with 2790
environmental laws and regulations, with consideration of the 2791
derating of any facility associated with those costs. 2792
In making any adjustment to the most recent standard 2793
service offer price on the basis of costs described in division 2794
(D) of this section, the commission shall include the benefits 2795
that may become available to the electric distribution utility 2796
as a result of or in connection with the costs included in the 2797
adjustment, including, but not limited to, the utility's receipt 2798
of emissions credits or its receipt of tax benefits or of other 2799
benefits, and, accordingly, the commission may impose such 2800
conditions on the adjustment to ensure that any such benefits 2801
are properly aligned with the associated cost responsibility. 2802
The commission shall also determine how such adjustments will 2803
affect the electric distribution utility's return on common 2804

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 97
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
equity that may be achieved by those adjustments. The commission 2805
shall not apply its consideration of the return on common equity 2806
to reduce any adjustments authorized under this division unless 2807
the adjustments will cause the electric distribution utility to 2808
earn a return on common equity that is significantly in excess 2809
of the return on common equity that is earned by publicly traded 2810
companies, including utilities, that face comparable business 2811
and financial risk, with such adjustments for capital structure 2812
as may be appropriate. The burden of proof for demonstrating 2813
that significantly excessive earnings will not occur shall be on 2814
the electric distribution utility. 2815
Additionally, the commission may adjust the electric 2816
distribution utility's most recent standard service offer price 2817
by such just and reasonable amount that the commission 2818
determines necessary to address any emergency that threatens the 2819
utility's financial integrity or to ensure that the resulting 2820
revenue available to the utility for providing the standard 2821
service offer is not so inadequate as to result, directly or 2822
indirectly, in a taking of property without compensation 2823
pursuant to Section 19 of Article I, Ohio Constitution. The 2824
electric distribution utility has the burden of demonstrating 2825
that any adjustment to its most recent standard service offer 2826
price is proper in accordance with this division. 2827
(E) Beginning in the second year of a blended price under 2828
division (D) of this section and notwithstanding any other 2829
requirement of this section, the commission may alter 2830
prospectively the proportions specified in that division to 2831
mitigate any effect of an abrupt or significant change in the 2832
electric distribution utility's standard service offer price 2833
that would otherwise result in general or with respect to any 2834
rate group or rate schedule but for such alteration. Any such 2835

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 98
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
alteration shall be made not more often than annually, and the 2836
commission shall not, by altering those proportions and in any 2837
event, including because of the length of time, as authorized 2838
under division (C) of this section, taken to approve the market 2839
rate offer, cause the duration of the blending period to exceed 2840
ten years as counted from the effective date of the approved 2841
market rate offer. Additionally, any such alteration shall be 2842
limited to an alteration affecting the prospective proportions 2843
used during the blending period and shall not affect any 2844
blending proportion previously approved and applied by the 2845
commission under this division. 2846
(F) An electric distribution utility that has received 2847
commission approval of its first application under division (C) 2848
of this section shall not, nor ever shall be authorized or 2849
required by the commission to, file an application under section 2850
4928.143 of the Revised Code. 2851
Sec. 4928.144. The public utilities commission by order 2852
may authorize any just and reasonable phase-in of any electric 2853
distribution utility rate or price established under sections 2854
4928.141 to 4928.143 and 4928.142 of the Revised Code, and 2855
inclusive of carrying charges, as the commission considers 2856
necessary to ensure rate or price stability for consumers. If 2857
the commission's order includes such a phase-in, the order also 2858
shall provide for the creation of regulatory assets pursuant to 2859
generally accepted accounting principles, by authorizing the 2860
deferral of incurred costs equal to the amount not collected, 2861
plus carrying charges on that amount. Further, the order shall 2862
authorize the collection of those deferrals through a 2863
nonbypassable surcharge on any such rate or price so established 2864
for the electric distribution utility by the commission. 2865

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 99
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
Sec. 4928.149. No electric distribution utility may use 2866
any electric energy storage system to participate in the 2867
wholesale market, if the utility purchased or acquired that 2868
system for distribution service. 2869
Sec. 4928.1410. If an electric distribution utility has a n 2870
existing electric security plan under which the commission had 2871
authorized the creation or continuation of riders, then, to the 2872
extent those riders will cease to exist after termination of the 2873
electric security plan, the electric distribution utility is 2874
authorized to create necessary regulatory assets or liabilities, 2875
along with carrying costs at the utility's weighted average cost 2876
of debt, for the resolution of any outstanding under-collection 2877
or over-collection of funds under such riders. The resolution of 2878
such regulatory assets or liabilities shall be addressed in the 2879
first distribution rate case under section 4909.18 of the 2880
Revised Code that occurs after the plan's expiration. 2881
Sec. 4928.17. (A) Except as otherwise provided in sections 2882
4928.141 or 4928.142 or 4928.143 or 4928.31 to 4928.40 of the 2883
Revised Code and beginning on the starting date of competitive 2884
retail electric service, no electric utility shall engage in 2885
this state, either directly or through an affiliate, in the 2886
businesses of supplying a noncompetitive retail electric service 2887
and supplying a competitive retail electric service, or in the 2888
businesses of supplying a noncompetitive retail electric service 2889
and supplying a product or service other than retail electric 2890
service, unless the utility implements and operates under a 2891
corporate separation plan that is approved by the public 2892
utilities commission under this section, is consistent with the 2893
policy specified in section 4928.02 of the Revised Code, and 2894
achieves all of the following: 2895

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 100
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
(1) The plan provides, at minimum, for the provision of 2896
the competitive retail electric service or the nonelectric 2897
product or service through a fully separated affiliate of the 2898
utility, and the plan includes separate accounting requirements, 2899
the code of conduct as ordered by the commission pursuant to a 2900
rule it shall adopt under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the 2901
Revised Code, and such other measures as are necessary to 2902
effectuate the policy specified in section 4928.02 of the 2903
Revised Code. 2904
(2) The plan satisfies the public interest in preventing 2905
unfair competitive advantage and preventing the abuse of market 2906
power. 2907
(3) The plan is sufficient to ensure that the utility will 2908
not extend any undue preference or advantage to any affiliate, 2909
division, or part of its own business engaged in the business of 2910
supplying the competitive retail electric service or nonelectric 2911
product or service, including, but not limited to, utility 2912
resources such as trucks, tools, office equipment, office space, 2913
supplies, customer and marketing information, advertising, 2914
billing and mailing systems, personnel, and training, without 2915
compensation based upon fully loaded embedded costs charged to 2916
the affiliate; and to ensure that any such affiliate, division, 2917
or part will not receive undue preference or advantage from any 2918
affiliate, division, or part of the business engaged in business 2919
of supplying the noncompetitive retail electric service. No such 2920
utility, affiliate, division, or part shall extend such undue 2921
preference. Notwithstanding any other division of this section, 2922
a utility's obligation under division (A)(3) of this section 2923
shall be effective January 1, 2000. 2924
(B) The commission may approve, modify and approve, or 2925

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 101
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
disapprove a corporate separation plan filed with the commission 2926
under division (A) of this section. As part of the code of 2927
conduct required under division (A)(1) of this section, the 2928
commission shall adopt rules pursuant to division (A) of section 2929
4928.06 of the Revised Code regarding corporate separation and 2930
procedures for plan filing and approval. The rules shall include 2931
limitations on affiliate practices solely for the purpose of 2932
maintaining a separation of the affiliate's business from the 2933
business of the utility to prevent unfair competitive advantage 2934
abuse of market power by virtue of that relationship. The rules 2935
also shall include an opportunity for any person having a real 2936
and substantial interest in the corporate separation plan to 2937
file specific objections to the plan and propose specific 2938
responses to issues raised in the objections, which objections 2939
and responses the commission shall address in its final order. 2940
Prior to commission approval of the plan, the commission shall 2941
afford a hearing upon those aspects of the plan that the 2942
commission determines reasonably require a hearing. The 2943
commission may reject and require refiling of a substantially 2944
inadequate plan under this section. 2945
(C) The commission shall issue an order approving or 2946
modifying and approving a corporate separation plan under this 2947
section, to be effective on the date specified in the order, 2948
only upon findings that the plan reasonably complies with the 2949
requirements of division (A) of this section and will provide 2950
for ongoing compliance with the policy specified in section 2951
4928.02 of the Revised Code. However, for good cause shown, the 2952
commission may issue an order approving or modifying and 2953
approving a corporate separation plan under this section that 2954
does not comply with division (A)(1) of this section but 2955
complies with such functional separation requirements as the 2956

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 102
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
commission authorizes to apply for an interim period prescribed 2957
in the order, upon a finding that such alternative plan will 2958
provide for ongoing compliance with the policy specified in 2959
section 4928.02 of the Revised Code. 2960
(D) Any party may seek an amendment to a corporate 2961
separation plan approved under this section, and the commission, 2962
pursuant to a request from any party or on its own initiative, 2963
may order as it considers necessary the filing of an amended 2964
corporate separation plan to reflect changed circumstances. 2965
(E) No electric distribution utility shall sell or 2966
transfer any generating asset it wholly or partly owns at any 2967
time without obtaining prior commission approval. 2968
Sec. 4928.20. (A) The legislative authority of a municipal 2969
corporation may adopt an ordinance, or the board of township 2970
trustees of a township or the board of county commissioners of a 2971
county may adopt a resolution, under which, on or after the 2972
starting date of competitive retail electric service, it may 2973
aggregate in accordance with this section the retail electrical 2974
loads located, respectively, within the municipal corporation, 2975
township, or unincorporated area of the county and, for that 2976
purpose, may enter into service agreements to facilitate for 2977
those loads the sale and purchase of electricity. The 2978
legislative authority or board also may exercise such authority 2979
jointly with any other such legislative authority or board. For 2980
customers that are not mercantile customers, an ordinance or 2981
resolution under this division shall specify whether the 2982
aggregation will occur only with the prior, affirmative consent 2983
of each person owning, occupying, controlling, or using an 2984
electric load center proposed to be aggregated or will occur 2985
automatically for all such persons pursuant to the opt-out 2986

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 103
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
requirements of division (D) of this section. The aggregation of 2987
mercantile customers shall occur only with the prior, 2988
affirmative consent of each such person owning, occupying, 2989
controlling, or using an electric load center proposed to be 2990
aggregated. Nothing in this division, however, authorizes the 2991
aggregation of the retail electric loads of an electric load 2992
center, as defined in section 4933.81 of the Revised Code, that 2993
is located in the certified territory of a nonprofit electric 2994
supplier under sections 4933.81 to 4933.90 of the Revised Code 2995
or an electric load center served by transmission or 2996
distribution facilities of a municipal electric utility. 2997
(B) If an ordinance or resolution adopted under division 2998
(A) of this section specifies that aggregation of customers that 2999
are not mercantile customers will occur automatically as 3000
described in that division, the ordinance or resolution shall 3001
direct the board of elections to submit the question of the 3002
authority to aggregate to the electors of the respective 3003
municipal corporation, township, or unincorporated area of a 3004
county at a special election on the day of the next primary or 3005

supplies a noncompetitive retail electric service through 3078
transmission or distribution facilities the utility singly or 3079
jointly owns or operates. 3080
(H) A governmental aggregator shall not include in its 3081
aggregation the accounts of any of the following: 3082

(J) On behalf of the customers that are part of a 3111
governmental aggregation under this section and by filing 3112
written notice with the public utilities commission, the 3113
legislative authority that formed or is forming that 3114
governmental aggregation may elect not to receive standby 3115
service within the meaning of division (B)(2)(d) of section 3116
4928.143 of the Revised Code from an electric distribution 3117
utility in whose certified territory the governmental 3118
aggregation is located and that operates under an approved 3119
electric security plan under that section. Upon the filing of 3120
that notice, the electric distribution utility shall not charge 3121
any such customer to whom competitive retail electric generation 3122
service is provided by another supplier under the governmental 3123
aggregation for the standby service. Any such consumer that 3124
returns to the utility for competitive retail electric service 3125
shall pay the market price of power incurred by the utility to 3126
serve that consumer plus any amount attributable to the 3127
utility's cost of compliance with the renewable energy resource 3128
provisions of section 4928.64 of the Revised Code to serve the 3129
consumer. Such market price shall include, but not be limited 3130
to, capacity and energy charges; all charges associated with the 3131
provision of that power supply through the regional transmission 3132
organization, including, but not limited to, transmission, 3133
ancillary services, congestion, and settlement and 3134
administrative charges; and all other costs incurred by the 3135
utility that are associated with the procurement, provision, and 3136
administration of that power supply, as such costs may be 3137

approved by the commission. The period of time during which the 3138
market price and renewable energy resource amount shall be so 3139
assessed on the consumer shall be from the time the consumer so 3140
returns to the electric distribution utility until the 3141
expiration of the electric security plan. However, if that 3142
period of time is expected to be more than two years, the 3143
commission may reduce the time period to a period of not less 3144
than two years. 3145
(K) The commission shall adopt rules and issue orders in 3146
proceedings under sections 4928.141 and 4928.142 of the Revised 3147
Code to encourage and promote large-scale governmental 3148
aggregation in this state. For that purpose, the commission 3149
shall conduct an immediate review of any rules it has adopted 3150
for the purpose of this section that are in effect on the 3151
effective date of the amendment of this section by S.B. 221 of 3152

the Revised Code, as that section existed prior to its repeal by 3155
this act, or a market rate offer under section 4928.142 of the 3156
Revised Code, as amended by this act, the commission shall 3157
consider the effect on large-scale governmental aggregation of 3158
any nonbypassable generation charges, however collected, under 3159
that plan, or that would be established under that planoffer, 3160
except any nonbypassable generation charges that relate to any 3161
cost incurred by the electric distribution utility, the deferral 3162

(7) Any other provision the commission considers 3429
appropriate to ensure the full and timely imposition, charging, 3430
collection, and adjustment, pursuant to an approved adjustment 3431
mechanism, of the phase-in-recovery charges described in 3432
divisions (E)(3) to (5) of this section. 3433
(F) The commission may, in a financing order, afford the 3434
electric distribution utility flexibility in establishing the 3435
terms and conditions for the phase-in-recovery bonds to 3436
accommodate changes in market conditions, including repayment 3437
schedules, interest rates, financing costs, collateral 3438
requirements, required debt service and other reserves, and the 3439
ability of the electric distribution utility, at its option, to 3440
effect a series of issuances of phase-in-recovery bonds and 3441
correlated assignments, sales, pledges, or other transfers of 3442
phase-in-recovery property. Any changes made under this section 3443
to terms and conditions for the phase-in-recovery bonds shall be 3444

phase-in-recovery property shall be simultaneous with the sale 3447
of that property to an assignee as provided in the application 3448
and the pledge of the property to secure phase-in-recovery 3449
bonds. 3450
(H) The commission shall, in a financing order, require 3451
that after the final terms of each issuance of phase-in-recovery 3452
bonds have been established, and prior to the issuance of those 3453
bonds, the electric distribution utility shall determine the 3454
resulting phase-in-recovery charges in accordance with the 3455
adjustment mechanism described in the financing order. These 3456
phase-in-recovery charges shall be final and effective upon the 3457
issuance of the phase-in-recovery bonds, without further 3458

commission action. 3459
Sec. 4928.34. (A) The public utilities commission shall 3460
not approve or prescribe a transition plan under division (A) or 3461
(B) of section 4928.33 of the Revised Code unless the commission 3462
first makes all of the following determinations: 3463
(1) The unbundled components for the electric transmission 3464
component of retail electric service, as specified in the 3465
utility's rate unbundling plan required by division (A)(1) of 3466
section 4928.31 of the Revised Code, equal the tariff rates 3467
determined by the federal energy regulatory commission that are 3468
in effect on the date of the approval of the transition plan 3469
under sections 4928.31 to 4928.40 of the Revised Code, as each 3470
such rate is determined applicable to each particular customer 3471
class and rate schedule by the commission. The unbundled 3472
transmission component shall include a sliding scale of charges 3473
under division (B) of section 4905.31 of the Revised Code to 3474
ensure that refunds determined or approved by the federal energy 3475
regulatory commission are flowed through to retail electric 3476
customers. 3477
(2) The unbundled components for retail electric 3478
distribution service in the rate unbundling plan equal the 3479
difference between the costs attributable to the utility's 3480
transmission and distribution rates and charges under its 3481
schedule of rates and charges in effect on the effective date of 3482
this section, based upon the record in the most recent rate 3483
proceeding of the utility for which the utility's schedule was 3484
established, and the tariff rates for electric transmission 3485
service determined by the federal energy regulatory commission 3486
as described in division (A)(1) of this section. 3487
(3) All other unbundled components required by the 3488

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 120
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
commission in the rate unbundling plan equal the costs 3489
attributable to the particular service as reflected in the 3490
utility's schedule of rates and charges in effect on the 3491
effective date of this section. 3492
(4) The unbundled components for retail electric 3493
generation service in the rate unbundling plan equal the 3494
residual amount remaining after the determination of the 3495
transmission, distribution, and other unbundled components, and 3496
after any adjustments necessary to reflect the effects of the 3497
amendment of section 5727.111 of the Revised Code by Sub. S.B. 3498
No. 3 of the 123rd general assembly. 3499
(5) All unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan 3500
have been adjusted to reflect any base rate reductions on file 3501
with the commission and as scheduled to be in effect by December 3502
31, 2005, under rate settlements in effect on the effective date 3503
of this section. However, all earnings obligations, 3504
restrictions, or caps imposed on an electric utility in a 3505
commission order prior to the effective date of this section are 3506
void. 3507
(6) Subject to division (A)(5) of this section, the total 3508
of all unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan are 3509
capped and shall equal during the market development period, 3510
except as specifically provided in this chapter, the total of 3511
all rates and charges in effect under the applicable bundled 3512
schedule of the electric utility pursuant to section 4905.30 of 3513
the Revised Code in effect on the day before the effective date 3514
of this section, including the transition charge determined 3515
under section 4928.40 of the Revised Code, adjusted for any 3516
changes in the taxation of electric utilities and retail 3517
electric service under Sub. S.B. No. 3 of the 123rd General 3518

Assembly, the universal service rider authorized by section 3519
4928.51 of the Revised Code, and the temporary rider authorized 3520
by section 4928.61 of the Revised Code. For the purpose of this 3521
division, the rate cap applicable to a customer receiving 3522
electric service pursuant to an arrangement approved by the 3523
commission under section 4905.31 of the Revised Code is, for the 3524
term of the arrangement, the total of all rates and charges in 3525
effect under the arrangement. For any rate schedule filed 3526
pursuant to section 4905.30 of the Revised Code or any 3527
arrangement subject to approval pursuant to section 4905.31 of 3528
the Revised Code, the initial tax-related adjustment to the rate 3529
cap required by this division shall be equal to the rate of 3530
taxation specified in section 5727.81 of the Revised Code and 3531
applicable to the schedule or arrangement. To the extent such 3532
total annual amount of the tax-related adjustment is greater 3533
than or less than the comparable amount of the total annual tax 3534
reduction experienced by the electric utility as a result of the 3535
provisions of Sub. S.B. No. 3 of the 123rd general assembly, 3536
such difference shall be addressed by the commission through 3537
accounting procedures, refunds, or an annual surcharge or credit 3538
to customers, or through other appropriate means, to avoid 3539
placing the financial responsibility for the difference upon the 3540
electric utility or its shareholders. Any adjustments in the 3541
rate of taxation specified in section 5727.81 of the Revised 3542
Code section shall not occur without a corresponding adjustment 3543
to the rate cap for each such rate schedule or arrangement. The 3544
department of taxation shall advise the commission and self- 3545
assessors under section 5727.81 of the Revised Code prior to the 3546
effective date of any change in the rate of taxation specified 3547
under that section, and the commission shall modify the rate cap 3548
to reflect that adjustment so that the rate cap adjustment is 3549
effective as of the effective date of the change in the rate of 3550

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 122
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
taxation. This division shall be applied, to the extent 3551
possible, to eliminate any increase in the price of electricity 3552
for customers that otherwise may occur as a result of 3553
establishing the taxes contemplated in section 5727.81 of the 3554
Revised Code. 3555
(7) The rate unbundling plan complies with any rules 3556
adopted by the commission under division (A) of section 4928.06 3557
of the Revised Code. 3558
(8) The corporate separation plan required by division (A) 3559
(2) of section 4928.31 of the Revised Code complies with section 3560
4928.17 of the Revised Code and any rules adopted by the 3561
commission under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the Revised 3562
Code. 3563
(9) Any plan or plans the commission requires to address 3564
operational support systems and any other technical 3565
implementation issues pertaining to competitive retail electric 3566
service comply with any rules adopted by the commission under 3567
division (A) of section 4928.06 of the Revised Code. 3568
(10) The employee assistance plan required by division (A) 3569
(4) of section 4928.31 of the Revised Code sufficiently provides 3570
severance, retraining, early retirement, retention, 3571
outplacement, and other assistance for the utility's employees 3572
whose employment is affected by electric industry restructuring 3573
under this chapter. 3574
(11) The consumer education plan required under division 3575
(A)(5) of section 4928.31 of the Revised Code complies with 3576
former section 4928.42 of the Revised Code and any rules adopted 3577
by the commission under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the 3578
Revised Code. 3579

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 123
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
(12) The transition revenues for which an electric utility 3580
is authorized a revenue opportunity under sections 4928.31 to 3581
4928.40 of the Revised Code are the allowable transition costs 3582
of the utility as such costs are determined by the commission 3583
pursuant to section 4928.39 of the Revised Code, and the 3584
transition charges for the customer classes and rate schedules 3585
of the utility are the charges determined pursuant to section 3586
4928.40 of the Revised Code. 3587
(13) Any independent transmission plan included in the 3588
transition plan filed under section 4928.31 of the Revised Code 3589
reasonably complies with section 4928.12 of the Revised Code and 3590
any rules adopted by the commission under division (A) of 3591
section 4928.06 of the Revised Code, unless the commission, for 3592
good cause shown, authorizes the utility to defer compliance 3593
until an order is issued under division (G) of section 4928.35 3594
of the Revised Code. 3595
(14) The utility is in compliance with sections 4928.01 to 3596
4928.11 of the Revised Code and any rules or orders of the 3597
commission adopted or issued under those sections. 3598
(15) All unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan 3599
have been adjusted to reflect the elimination of the tax on 3600
gross receipts imposed by section 5727.30 of the Revised Code. 3601
In addition, a transition plan approved by the commission 3602
under section 4928.33 of the Revised Code but not containing an 3603
approved independent transmission plan shall contain the express 3604
conditions that the utility will comply with an order issued 3605
under division (G) of section 4928.35 of the Revised Code. 3606
(B) Subject to division (E) of section 4928.17 of the 3607
Revised Code, if If the commission finds that any part of the 3608

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 124
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
transition plan would constitute an abandonment under sections 3609
4905.20 and 4905.21 of the Revised Code, the commission shall 3610
not approve that part of the transition plan unless it makes the 3611
finding required for approval of an abandonment application 3612
under section 4905.21 of the Revised Code. Sections 4905.20 and 3613
4905.21 of the Revised Code otherwise shall not apply to a 3614
transition plan under sections 4928.31 to 4928.40 of the Revised 3615
Code. 3616
Sec. 4928.542. The winning bid or bids selected through 3617
the competitive procurement process established under section 3618
4928.54 of the Revised Code shall meet all of the following 3619
requirements: 3620
(A) Be designed to provide reliable competitive retail 3621
electric service to percentage of income payment plan program 3622
customers; 3623
(B) Reduce the cost of the percentage of income payment 3624
plan program relative to the otherwise applicable standard 3625
service offer established under sections 4928.141, and 4928.142, 3626
and 4928.143 of the Revised Code; 3627
(C) Result in the best value for persons paying the 3628
universal service rider under section 4928.52 of the Revised 3629
Code. 3630
Sec. 4928.64. (A)(1) As used in this section, "qualifying 3631
renewable energy resource" means a renewable energy resource, as 3632
defined in section 4928.01 of the Revised Code that: 3633
(a) Has a placed-in-service date on or after January 1, 3634
1998; 3635
(b) Is any run-of-the-river hydroelectric facility that 3636
has an in-service date on or after January 1, 1980; 3637

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 125

(c) Is a small hydroelectric facility; 3638
(d) Is created on or after January 1, 1998, by the 3639
modification or retrofit of any facility placed in service prior 3640
to January 1, 1998; or 3641
(e) Is a mercantile customer-sited renewable energy 3642
resource, whether new or existing, that the mercantile customer 3643
commits for integration into the electric distribution utility's 3644
demand-response, energy efficiency, or peak demand reduction 3645
programs as provided under division (A)(2)(c) of section 4928.66 3646
of the Revised Code, including, but not limited to, any of the 3647
following: 3648
(i) A resource that has the effect of improving the 3649
relationship between real and reactive power; 3650
(ii) A resource that makes efficient use of waste heat or 3651
other thermal capabilities owned or controlled by a mercantile 3652
customer; 3653
(iii) Storage technology that allows a mercantile customer 3654
more flexibility to modify its demand or load and usage 3655
characteristics; 3656
(iv) Electric generation equipment owned or controlled by 3657
a mercantile customer that uses a renewable energy resource. 3658
(2) For the purpose of this section and as it considers 3659
appropriate, the public utilities commission may classify any 3660
new technology as such a qualifying renewable energy resource. 3661
(B)(1) By the end of 2026, an electric distribution 3662
utility shall have provided from qualifying renewable energy 3663
resources, including, at its discretion, qualifying renewable 3664
energy resources obtained pursuant to an electricity supply 3665

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 126
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
contract, a portion of the electricity supply required for its 3666
standard service offer under section sections 4928.141 and 3667
4928.142 of the Revised Code, and an electric services company 3668
shall have provided a portion of its electricity supply for 3669
retail consumers in this state from qualifying renewable energy 3670
resources, including, at its discretion, qualifying renewable 3671
energy resources obtained pursuant to an electricity supply 3672
contract. That portion shall equal eight and one-half per cent 3673
of the total number of kilowatt hours of electricity sold by the 3674
subject utility or company to any and all retail electric 3675
consumers whose electric load centers are served by that utility 3676
and are located within the utility's certified territory or, in 3677
the case of an electric services company, are served by the 3678
company and are located within this state. However, nothing in 3679
this section precludes a utility or company from providing a 3680
greater percentage. 3681
(2) Subject to section 4928.642 of the Revised Code, the 3682
The portion required under division (B)(1) of this section shall 3683
be generated from renewable energy resources in accordance with 3684
the following benchmarks: 3685

(3) The qualifying renewable energy resources implemented 3687
by the utility or company shall be met either: 3688
(a) Through facilities located in this state; or 3689
(b) With resources that can be shown to be deliverable 3690
into this state. 3691
(C)(1) The commission annually shall review an electric 3692

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 128
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
distribution utility's or electric services company's compliance 3693
with the most recent applicable benchmark under division (B)(2) 3694
of this section and, in the course of that review, shall 3695
identify any undercompliance or noncompliance of the utility or 3696
company that it determines is weather-related, related to 3697
equipment or resource shortages for qualifying renewable energy 3698
resources as applicable, or is otherwise outside the utility's 3699
or company's control. 3700
(2) Subject to the cost cap provisions of division (C)(3) 3701
of this section, if the commission determines, after notice and 3702
opportunity for hearing, and based upon its findings in that 3703
review regarding avoidable undercompliance or noncompliance, but 3704
subject to division (C)(4) of this section, that the utility or 3705
company has failed to comply with any such benchmark, the 3706
commission shall impose a renewable energy compliance payment on 3707
the utility or company. 3708
(a) The compliance payment pertaining to the solar energy 3709
resource benchmarks under division (B)(2) of this section shall 3710
be an amount per megawatt hour of undercompliance or 3711
noncompliance in the period under review, as follows: 3712
(i) Three hundred dollars for 2014, 2015, and 2016; 3713
(ii) Two hundred fifty dollars for 2017 and 2018; 3714
(iii) Two hundred dollars for 2019. 3715
(b) The compliance payment pertaining to the renewable 3716
energy resource benchmarks under division (B)(2) of this section 3717
shall equal the number of additional renewable energy credits 3718
that the electric distribution utility or electric services 3719
company would have needed to comply with the applicable 3720
benchmark in the period under review times an amount that shall 3721

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 129
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
begin at forty-five dollars and shall be adjusted annually by 3722
the commission to reflect any change in the consumer price index 3723
as defined in section 101.27 of the Revised Code, but shall not 3724
be less than forty-five dollars. As used in this division, 3725
"consumer price index" means the consumer price index prepared 3726
by the United States bureau of labor statistics (U.S. city 3727
average for urban wage earners and clerical workers: all items, 3728
1982-1984=100), or, if that index is no longer published, a 3729
generally available comparable index. 3730
(c) The compliance payment shall not be passed through by 3731
the electric distribution utility or electric services company 3732
to consumers. The compliance payment shall be remitted to the 3733
commission, for deposit to the credit of the advanced energy 3734
fund created under section 4928.61 of the Revised Code. Payment 3735
of the compliance payment shall be subject to such collection 3736
and enforcement procedures as apply to the collection of a 3737
forfeiture under sections 4905.55 to 4905.60 and 4905.64 of the 3738
Revised Code. 3739
(3) An electric distribution utility or an electric 3740
services company need not comply with a benchmark under division 3741
(B)(2) of this section to the extent that its reasonably 3742
expected cost of that compliance exceeds its reasonably expected 3743
cost of otherwise producing or acquiring the requisite 3744
electricity by three per cent or more. The cost of compliance 3745
shall be calculated as though any exemption from taxes and 3746
assessments had not been granted under section 5727.75 of the 3747
Revised Code. 3748
(4)(a) An electric distribution utility or electric 3749
services company may request the commission to make a force 3750
majeure determination pursuant to this division regarding all or 3751

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 130
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
part of the utility's or company's compliance with any minimum 3752
benchmark under division (B)(2) of this section during the 3753
period of review occurring pursuant to division (C)(2) of this 3754
section. The commission may require the electric distribution 3755
utility or electric services company to make solicitations for 3756
renewable energy resource credits as part of its default service 3757
before the utility's or company's request of force majeure under 3758
this division can be made. 3759
(b) Within ninety days after the filing of a request by an 3760
electric distribution utility or electric services company under 3761
division (C)(4)(a) of this section, the commission shall 3762
determine if qualifying renewable energy resources are 3763
reasonably available in the marketplace in sufficient quantities 3764
for the utility or company to comply with the subject minimum 3765
benchmark during the review period. In making this 3766
determination, the commission shall consider whether the 3767
electric distribution utility or electric services company has 3768
made a good faith effort to acquire sufficient qualifying 3769
renewable energy or, as applicable, solar energy resources to so 3770
comply, including, but not limited to, by banking or seeking 3771
renewable energy resource credits or by seeking the resources 3772
through long-term contracts. Additionally, the commission shall 3773
consider the availability of qualifying renewable energy or 3774
solar energy resources in this state and other jurisdictions in 3775
the PJM interconnection regional transmission organization, 3776
L.L.C., or its successor and the midcontinent independent system 3777
operator or its successor. 3778
(c) If, pursuant to division (C)(4)(b) of this section, 3779
the commission determines that qualifying renewable energy or 3780
solar energy resources are not reasonably available to permit 3781
the electric distribution utility or electric services company 3782

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 131
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
to comply, during the period of review, with the subject minimum 3783
benchmark prescribed under division (B)(2) of this section, the 3784
commission shall modify that compliance obligation of the 3785
utility or company as it determines appropriate to accommodate 3786
the finding. Commission modification shall not automatically 3787
reduce the obligation for the electric distribution utility's or 3788
electric services company's compliance in subsequent years. If 3789
it modifies the electric distribution utility or electric 3790
services company obligation under division (C)(4)(c) of this 3791
section, the commission may require the utility or company, if 3792
sufficient renewable energy resource credits exist in the 3793
marketplace, to acquire additional renewable energy resource 3794
credits in subsequent years equivalent to the utility's or 3795
company's modified obligation under division (C)(4)(c) of this 3796
section. 3797
(5) The commission shall establish a process to provide 3798
for at least an annual review of the renewable energy resource 3799
market in this state and in the service territories of the 3800
regional transmission organizations that manage transmission 3801
systems located in this state. The commission shall use the 3802
results of this study to identify any needed changes to the 3803
amount of the renewable energy compliance payment specified 3804
under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of this section. Specifically, 3805
the commission may increase the amount to ensure that payment of 3806
compliance payments is not used to achieve compliance with this 3807
section in lieu of actually acquiring or realizing energy 3808
derived from qualifying renewable energy resources. However, if 3809
the commission finds that the amount of the compliance payment 3810
should be otherwise changed, the commission shall present this 3811

the seller may only provide renewable energy credits for metered 3854
amounts of gas. 3855
(B)(1) The public utilities commission shall adopt rules 3856
specifying that one unit of credit shall equal one megawatt hour 3857
of electricity derived from renewable energy resources, except 3858
that, for a generating facility of seventy-five megawatts or 3859
greater that is situated within this state and has committed by 3860
December 31, 2009, to modify or retrofit its generating unit or 3861
units to enable the facility to generate principally from 3862
biomass energy by June 30, 2013, each megawatt hour of 3863
electricity generated principally from that biomass energy shall 3864
equal, in units of credit, the product obtained by multiplying 3865
the actual percentage of biomass feedstock heat input used to 3866
generate such megawatt hour by the quotient obtained by dividing 3867
the then existing unit dollar amount used to determine a 3868
renewable energy compliance payment as provided under division 3869
(C)(2)(b) of section 4928.64 of the Revised Code by the then 3870
existing market value of one renewable energy credit, but such 3871

of registering renewable energy credits by specifying which of 3880
any generally available registries shall be used for that 3881
purpose and not by creating a registry. That selected system of 3882
registering renewable energy credits shall allow a hydroelectric 3883
generating facility to be eligible for obtaining renewable 3884
energy credits and shall allow customer-sited projects or 3885
actions the broadest opportunities to be eligible for obtaining 3886
renewable energy credits. 3887

section, the true value of all taxable property, except property 4456
of a railroad company, required by section 5727.06 of the 4457
Revised Code to be assessed by the tax commissioner shall be 4458
determined by a method of valuation using cost as capitalized on 4459
the public utility's books and records less composite annual 4460
allowances as prescribed by the commissioner. If the 4461
commissioner finds that application of this method will not 4462

by (b) the total number of months the natural gas company was in 4478
business during the calendar year prior to the beginning of the 4479
tax year. With the approval of the tax commissioner, a natural 4480
gas company may use a date other than the end of a calendar 4481
month to value its current gas stored underground. 4482
(C) The true value of noncurrent gas stored underground is 4483
thirty-five per cent of the cost of that gas shown on the books 4484

of the equipment as capitalized on the company's books and 4498
records less composite annual allowances as prescribed by the 4499

the allowance for funds used during construction or interest 4504
during construction that has been capitalized on the public 4505
utility's books and records as part of the total cost of the 4506
taxable property. This division shall not apply to the taxable 4507
property of an electric company or a rural electric company, 4508
excluding transmission and distribution property, first placed 4509
into service after December 31, 2000, or to the taxable property 4510
a person purchases, which includes transfers, if that property 4511
was used in business by the seller prior to the purchase. 4512

number of revenue-earning miles traveled by the watercraft in 4517
the waters of this state and the denominator of which is the 4518
number of revenue-earning miles traveled by the watercraft in 4519
all waters. 4520

public utility includes amounts capitalized that represent 4526
regulatory assets, if such amounts previously were included on 4527
the company's books and records as capitalized costs of taxable 4528
personal property. 4529
(I) Any change in the composite annual allowances as 4530
prescribed by the commissioner on a prospective basis shall not 4531
be admissible in any judicial or administrative action or 4532
proceeding as evidence of value with regard to prior years' 4533
taxes. Information about the business, property, or transactions 4534
of any taxpayer obtained by the commissioner for the purpose of 4535
adopting or modifying the composite annual allowances shall not 4536
be subject to discovery or disclosure. 4537

division (B)(1)(a) of this section, or the date the contract for 4658
the construction or installation of the energy facility is 4659
entered into. 4660
(c) For a qualified energy project with a nameplate 4661
capacity of twenty megawatts or greater, a board of county 4662
commissioners of a county in which property of the project is 4663
located has adopted a resolution under division (E)(1)(b) or (c) 4664
of this section to approve the application submitted under 4665
division (E) of this section to exempt the property located in 4666
that county from taxation. A board's adoption of a resolution 4667
rejecting an application or its failure to adopt a resolution 4668
approving the application does not affect the tax-exempt status 4669
of the qualified energy project's property that is located in 4670
another county. 4671
(2) If tangible personal property of a qualified energy 4672
project using renewable energy resources was exempt from 4673
taxation under this section beginning in any of tax years 2011 4674
through the applicable year, and the certification under 4675
division (E)(2) of this section has not been revoked, the 4676
tangible personal property of the qualified energy project is 4677
exempt from taxation for the tax year following the applicable 4678
year and all ensuing tax years if the property was placed into 4679
service before the first day of the tax year following the 4680
applicable year, as certified in the construction progress 4681
report required under division (F)(2) of this section. Tangible 4682
personal property that has not been placed into service before 4683
that date is taxable property subject to taxation. An energy 4684
project for which certification has been revoked is ineligible 4685
for further exemption under this section. Revocation does not 4686
affect the tax-exempt status of the project's tangible personal 4687
property for the tax year in which revocation occurs or any 4688

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 162

prior tax year. 4689
(C) Tangible personal property of a qualified energy 4690
project using clean coal technology, advanced nuclear 4691
technology, or cogeneration technology is exempt from taxation 4692
for the first tax year that the property would be listed for 4693
taxation and all subsequent years if all of the following 4694
circumstances are met: 4695
(1) The property was placed into service before January 1, 4696
2021. Tangible personal property that has not been placed into 4697
service before that date is taxable property subject to 4698
taxation. 4699
(2) For such a qualified energy project with a nameplate 4700
capacity of twenty megawatts or greater, a board of county 4701
commissioners of a county in which property of the qualified 4702
energy project is located has adopted a resolution under 4703
division (E)(1)(b) or (c) of this section to approve the 4704
application submitted under division (E) of this section to 4705
exempt the property located in that county from taxation. A 4706
board's adoption of a resolution rejecting the application or 4707
its failure to adopt a resolution approving the application does 4708
not affect the tax-exempt status of the qualified energy 4709
project's property that is located in another county. 4710
(3) The certification for the qualified energy project 4711
issued under division (E)(2) of this section has not been 4712
revoked. An energy project for which certification has been 4713
revoked is ineligible for exemption under this section. 4714
Revocation does not affect the tax-exempt status of the 4715
project's tangible personal property for the tax year in which 4716
revocation occurs or any prior tax year. 4717

to each taxing unit with territory located in each of the 4734
affected counties. Any board that receives from the director a 4735
copy of an application submitted under this division shall adopt 4736
a resolution approving or rejecting the application unless it 4737
has adopted a resolution under division (E)(1)(c) of this 4738
section. A resolution adopted under division (E)(1)(b) or (c) of 4739
this section may require an annual service payment to be made in 4740
addition to the service payment required under division (G) of 4741
this section. The sum of the service payment required in the 4742
resolution and the service payment required under division (G) 4743
of this section shall not exceed nine thousand dollars per 4744

Sub. S. B. No. 2 Page 175
As Pending in the Senate Energy Committee
section 3706.46 of the Revised Code to meet the revenue 5075
requirement for disbursements from the Solar Generation Fund to 5076
owners or operators of qualifying solar resources that was 5077
required under section 3706.55 of the Revised Code before the 5078
repeal of these sections by this act. 5079
Section 5. Section 4909.193 as enacted by this act and the 5080
amendments to section 4909.42 of the Revised Code by this act 5081
apply to applications filed under section 4909.18 of the Revised 5082
Code on or after the effective date of this section. 5083
Section 6. On the effective date of this section, or as 5084
soon as possible thereafter, the Treasurer of State shall 5085
transfer the cash balance of amounts remaining in the solar 5086
generation fund to the school energy efficiency loan fund 5087
created in section 3706.52 of the Revised Code. 5088
Section 7. Section 4928.01 of the Revised Code is 5089
presented in this act as a composite of the section as amended 5090
by both H.B. 308 and H.B. 315 of the 135th General Assembly. The 5091
General Assembly, applying the principle stated in division (B) 5092
of section 1.52 of the Revised Code that amendments are to be 5093
harmonized if reasonably capable of simultaneous operation, 5094
finds that the composite is the resulting version of the section 5095
in effect prior to the effective date of the section as 5096
presented in this act. 5097
