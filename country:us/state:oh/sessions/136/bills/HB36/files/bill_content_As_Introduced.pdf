shall be executed by causing the application to the person, upon 56

or combination of drugs of sufficient dosage to quickly and 58
painlessly cause death. The application of the drug or 59
combination of drugs shall be continued until the person is 60

section. If a person timely elects nitrogen hypoxia, the death 71

quantity of nitrogen gas of sufficient dosage to quickly cause 74
death. The application of the nitrogen gas shall be continued 75

until the person is dead. The warden of the correctional 76
institution in which the sentence is to be executed or another 77
person selected by the director of rehabilitation and correction 78
shall ensure that the death sentence is executed. 79
(C)(1) Except as provided in division (C)(2) of this 80
section, if a person does not timely elect nitrogen hypoxia, 81
does not elect either nitrogen hypoxia or lethal injection, or 82
elects lethal injection, the death penalty shall be executed by 83
lethal injection pursuant to division (A) of this section. 84
(2) If, at the time a death sentence is to be executed, 85
the death sentence cannot be executed by lethal injection, the 86
death sentence shall be executed by nitrogen hypoxia, as if the 87
person upon whom the death sentence was imposed had elected 88
nitrogen hypoxia under division (B) of this section. 89
(D) A death sentence shall be executed within the walls of 90
the state correctional institution designated by the director of 91
rehabilitation and correction as the location for executions, 92
within an enclosure to be prepared for that purpose, under the 93
direction of the warden of the institution or, in the warden's 94
absence, a deputy warden, and on the day designated by the judge 95
passing sentence or otherwise designated by a court in the 96
course of any appellate or postconviction proceedings. The 97
enclosure shall exclude public view. 98
(C) (E) If a person is sentenced to death, and if the 99
execution of a death sentence by lethal injection or nitrogen 100
hypoxia has been determined to be unconstitutional by the Ohio 101
supreme court under the Ohio constitution, the death sentence or 102
has been determined to be unconstitutional by the United States 103
supreme court under the United States constitution, or if the 104
United States supreme court declines to review any judgment 105

H. B. No. 36 Page 5
As Introduced
holding a method of execution to be unconstitutional under the 106
United States constitution made by the Ohio supreme court or the 107
United States court of appeals that has jurisdiction over Ohio, 108
then all persons sentenced to death shall be executed by using 109
any different manner of execution prescribed by law subsequent 110
to the effective date of this amendment instead of by causing 111
the application to the person of a lethal injection of a drug or 112
combination of drugs of sufficient dosage to quickly and 113
painlessly cause death, provided that the subsequently 114
prescribed different manner of execution has not been determined 115
to be unconstitutional. The use of the subsequently prescribed 116
different manner of execution shall be continued until the 117
person is dead. The warden of the state correctional institution 118
in which the sentence is to be executed or another person 119
selected by the director of rehabilitation and correction shall 120
ensure that the sentence of death is executed. 121
(D) No change in the law made by the amendment to this 122
section that took effect on October 1, 1993, or by this 123
amendment constitutes a declaration by or belief of the general 124
assembly that execution of a death sentence by electrocution is 125
a cruel and unusual punishment proscribed by (F) No sentence of 126
death shall be reduced as a result of a determination that a 127
method of execution is declared unconstitutional under the Ohio 128
Constitution or the United States Constitution. In any case in 129
which an execution method is declared unconstitutional, the 130
death sentence remains in force until the sentence can be 131
lawfully executed by any valid method of execution. 132
