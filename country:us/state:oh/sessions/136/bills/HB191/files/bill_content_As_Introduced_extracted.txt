submission as a whole, and the submission is deemed approved if 127
the legislative body fails to act within thirty days after the 128
public employer submits the agreement. The parties may specify 129
that those provisions of the agreement not requiring action by a 130
legislative body are effective and operative in accordance with 131
the terms of the agreement, provided there has been compliance 132
with division (C) of this section. If the legislative body 133

determining whether school districts are in compliance with this 384

Section 18:
section. At the time a school district is audited pursuant to 385

Section 19:
section 117.11 of the Revised Code, the auditor of state shall 386
review each certificate issued under this section since the 387
district's last audit, and the appropriation measure, contract, 388
or wage and salary schedule to which such certificate was 389
attached. If the auditor of state determines that a school 390
district has not complied with this section with respect to any 391
qualifying contract or wage or salary schedule, the auditor of 392
state shall notify the prosecuting attorney for the county, the 393
city director of law, or other chief law officer of the school 394

district from the payee the amount of payments already made 398
under it, or both, except that the officer shall not seek to 399
recover payments made under any collective bargaining agreement 400

of section 3317.13 of the Revised Code, provided the contract or 409
increase does not exceed the amount required to be paid to be in 410
compliance with such divisionthat section. 411

authorizes the expenditure of any public funds or authorizes or 413
executes any contract or schedule contrary to this section, 414

section which contains any false statements is liable to the 417
school district for the full amount paid from the district's 418
funds on the contract or schedule. The officer, employee, or 419
other person is jointly and severally liable in person and upon 420
any official bond that the officer, employee, or other person 421
has given to the school district to the extent of any payments 422
on the void claim, not to exceed ten thousand dollars. However, 423
no officer, employee, or other person shall be liable for a 424
mistaken estimate of available resources made in good faith and 425
based upon reasonable grounds. If an officer, employee, or other 426
person is found to have complied with rules jointly adopted by 427
the department of education and workforce and the auditor of 428
state under this section governing methods by which revenue 429
shall be estimated and determined sufficient to provide 430
necessary operating revenue for the purpose of making 431
certifications required by this section, the officer, employee, 432
or other person shall not be liable under this section if the 433
estimates and determinations made according to those rules do 434

not, in fact, conform with actual revenue. The prosecuting 435
attorney of the county, the city director of law, or other chief 436
law officer of the district shall enforce this liability by 437
civil action brought in any court of appropriate jurisdiction in 438
the name of and on behalf of the school district. If the 439
prosecuting attorney, city director of law, or other chief law 440
officer of the district fails, upon the written request of any 441
taxpayer, to institute action for the enforcement of the 442
liability, the attorney general, or the taxpayer in the 443
taxpayer's own name, may institute the action on behalf of the 444
subdivision. 445

BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF OHIO:
Section 1. That sections 3317.14, 4117.10, 5126.24, and 7
5705.412 be amended and new section 3317.13 of the Revised Code 8

vocational school district board of education or educational 11
service center governing board shall pay a teacher a base salary 12
of less than fifty thousand dollars. 13
Sec. 3317.14. Any school district board of education or 14

H. B. No. 191 Page 2
As Introduced
Notwithstanding sections 3317.13 and 3319.088 of the Revised 19
Code, the board may establish its own service requirements and 20
may grant service credit for such activities as teaching in 21
public or nonpublic schools in this state or in another state, 22
for service as an educational assistant other than as a 23
classroom aide employed in accordance with section 5107.541 of 24
the Revised Code, and for service in the military or in an 25
appropriate state or federal governmental agency, provided no 26
teacher receives less than the amount required to be paid 27
pursuant to section 3317.13 of the Revised Code and provided 28
full credit for a minimum of five years of actual teaching and 29
military experience as defined in division (A) of section 30
3317.13 of the Revised Code is given to each teacher. 31
Each teacher who has completed training which would 32
qualify such teacher for a higher salary bracket pursuant to 33
this section shall file by the fifteenth day of September with 34
the treasurer of the board of education or educational service 35
center satisfactory evidence of the completion of such 36
additional training. The treasurer shall then immediately place 37
the teacher, pursuant to this section and section 3317.13 of the 38
Revised Code, in the proper salary bracket in accordance with 39
training and years of service before certifying such salary, 40
training, and years of service to the department of education 41
and workforce. No teacher shall be paid less than the salary to 42
which such teacher is entitled pursuant to section 3317.13 of 43
the Revised Code. 44
Sec. 4117.10. (A) An agreement between a public employer 45
and an exclusive representative entered into pursuant to this 46
chapter governs the wages, hours, and terms and conditions of 47
public employment covered by the agreement. If the agreement 48
provides for a final and binding arbitration of grievances, 49

H. B. No. 191 Page 3
As Introduced
public employers, employees, and employee organizations are 50
subject solely to that grievance procedure and the state 51
personnel board of review or civil service commissions have no 52
jurisdiction to receive and determine any appeals relating to 53
matters that were the subject of a final and binding grievance 54
procedure. Where no agreement exists or where an agreement makes 55
no specification about a matter, the public employer and public 56
employees are subject to all applicable state or local laws or 57
ordinances pertaining to the wages, hours, and terms and 58
conditions of employment for public employees. All of the 59
following prevail over conflicting provisions of agreements 60
between employee organizations and public employers: 61
(1) Laws pertaining to any of the following subjects: 62
(a) Civil rights; 63
(b) Affirmative action; 64
(c) Unemployment compensation; 65
(d) Workers' compensation; 66
(e) The retirement of public employees; 67
(f) Residency requirements; 68

district pursuant to section 5705.41 of the Revised Code; 72
(h) The provisions of division (A) of section 124.34 of 73
the Revised Code governing the disciplining of officers and 74
employees who have been convicted of a felony; 75
(i) The minimum standards promulgated by the director of 76

H. B. No. 191 Page 4
As Introduced
education and workforce pursuant to division (D) of section 77
3301.07 of the Revised Code. 78
(2) The law pertaining to the leave of absence and 79
compensation provided under section 5923.05 of the Revised Code, 80
if the terms of the agreement contain benefits which are less 81
than those contained in that section or the agreement contains 82
no such terms and the public authority is the state or any 83
agency, authority, commission, or board of the state or if the 84
public authority is another entity listed in division (B) of 85
section 4117.01 of the Revised Code that elects to provide leave 86
of absence and compensation as provided in section 5923.05 of 87
the Revised Code; 88
(3) The law pertaining to the leave established under 89
section 5906.02 of the Revised Code, if the terms of the 90
agreement contain benefits that are less than those contained in 91
section 5906.02 of the Revised Code; 92
(4) The law pertaining to excess benefits prohibited under 93
section 3345.311 of the Revised Code with respect to an 94
agreement between an employee organization and a public employer 95
entered into on or after September 29, 2015. 96
(5) For any collective bargaining agreement entered into 97
on or after the effective date of this amendment, the law 98
pertaining to compensation required pursuant to section 3317.13 99
of the Revised Code, if the terms of the agreement provide for 100
wages or compensation that are less than the minimum required 101
under that section. 102
Except for sections 306.08, 306.12, 306.35, and 4981.22 of 103
the Revised Code and arrangements entered into thereunder, and 104
section 4981.21 of the Revised Code as necessary to comply with 105

H. B. No. 191 Page 5
As Introduced
section 13(c) of the "Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964," 87 106
Stat. 295, 49 U.S.C.A. 1609(c), as amended, and arrangements 107
entered into thereunder, this chapter prevails over any and all 108
other conflicting laws, resolutions, provisions, present or 109
future, except as otherwise specified in this chapter or as 110
otherwise specified by the general assembly. Nothing in this 111
section prohibits or shall be construed to invalidate the 112
provisions of an agreement establishing supplemental workers' 113
compensation or unemployment compensation benefits or exceeding 114
minimum requirements contained in the Revised Code pertaining to 115
public education or the minimum standards promulgated by the 116
director of education and workforce pursuant to division (D) of 117
section 3301.07 of the Revised Code. 118
(B) The public employer shall submit a request for funds 119
necessary to implement an agreement and for approval of any 120
other matter requiring the approval of the appropriate 121
legislative body to the legislative body within fourteen days of 122
the date on which the parties finalize the agreement, unless 123
otherwise specified, but if the appropriate legislative body is 124
not in session at the time, then within fourteen days after it 125
convenes. The legislative body must approve or reject the 126
submission as a whole, and the submission is deemed approved if 127
the legislative body fails to act within thirty days after the 128
public employer submits the agreement. The parties may specify 129
that those provisions of the agreement not requiring action by a 130
legislative body are effective and operative in accordance with 131
the terms of the agreement, provided there has been compliance 132
with division (C) of this section. If the legislative body 133
rejects the submission of the public employer, either party may 134
reopen all or part of the entire agreement. 135
As used in this section, "legislative body" includes the 136

H. B. No. 191 Page 6
As Introduced
governing board of a municipal corporation, school district, 137
college or university, village, township, or board of county 138
commissioners or any other body that has authority to approve 139
the budget of their public jurisdiction and, with regard to the 140
state, "legislative body" means the controlling board. 141
(C) The chief executive officer, or the chief executive 142
officer's representative, of each municipal corporation, the 143
designated representative of the board of education of each 144
school district, college or university, or any other body that 145
has authority to approve the budget of their public 146
jurisdiction, the designated representative of the board of 147
county commissioners and of each elected officeholder of the 148
county whose employees are covered by the collective 149
negotiations, and the designated representative of the village 150
or the board of township trustees of each township is 151
responsible for negotiations in the collective bargaining 152
process; except that the legislative body may accept or reject a 153
proposed collective bargaining agreement. When the matters about 154
which there is agreement are reduced to writing and approved by 155
the employee organization and the legislative body, the 156
agreement is binding upon the legislative body, the employer, 157
and the employee organization and employees covered by the 158
agreement. 159
(D) There is hereby established an office of collective 160
bargaining in the department of administrative services for the 161
purpose of negotiating with and entering into written agreements 162
between state agencies, departments, boards, and commissions and 163
the exclusive representative on matters of wages, hours, terms 164
and other conditions of employment and the continuation, 165
modification, or deletion of an existing provision of a 166
collective bargaining agreement. Nothing in any provision of law 167

H. B. No. 191 Page 7
As Introduced
to the contrary shall be interpreted as excluding the bureau of 168
workers' compensation and the industrial commission from the 169
preceding sentence. This office shall not negotiate on behalf of 170
other statewide elected officials or boards of trustees of state 171
institutions of higher education who shall be considered as 172
separate public employers for the purposes of this chapter; 173
however, the office may negotiate on behalf of these officials 174
or trustees where authorized by the officials or trustees. The 175
staff of the office of collective bargaining are in the 176
unclassified service. The director of administrative services 177
shall fix the compensation of the staff. 178

forthwith. If this condition is not corrected within ten days 292
after receipt of the order from the director, no money shall be 293

fiscal year in which a certificate is required, the certificate 337
attached to an appropriation measure shall include the number of 338
days on which instruction was held in the preceding fiscal year 339
and other certificates required under this section shall include 340
that number of days for the fiscal year in which the certificate 341
is required and any succeeding fiscal years that the certificate 342
must cover. 343

program of the district; 356
(b) The multi-year contract demonstrates savings over the 357

currently facing in future years as demonstrated in its five- 361
year forecast adopted in accordance with section 5705.391 of the 362
Revised Code. 363
The certificate shall be signed by the treasurer and 364

under it, or both, except that the officer shall not seek to 399

has given to the school district to the extent of any payments 422
on the void claim, not to exceed ten thousand dollars. However, 423
no officer, employee, or other person shall be liable for a 424
mistaken estimate of available resources made in good faith and 425
based upon reasonable grounds. If an officer, employee, or other 426
person is found to have complied with rules jointly adopted by 427
the department of education and workforce and the auditor of 428

shall be estimated and determined sufficient to provide 430
