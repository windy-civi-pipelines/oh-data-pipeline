Honoring Hotel Lakeside on its One Hundred Fiftieth
Anniversary.
WHEREAS, The members of the Senate of the 136th General Assembly 1
of Ohio are pleased to commend Hotel Lakeside on the occasion of its 2
One Hundred Fiftieth Anniversary and rededication ceremony, celebrated 3
August 2, 2025; and 4
WHEREAS, A notable local landmark listed on the National Register 5
of Historic Places, Hotel Lakeside holds a unique place in the history 6
of the area, and it is fitting that the anniversary of this building 7
be enthusiastically commemorated. Built in 1875, the hotel has 8
welcomed numerous dignitaries and celebrities and witnessed many 9
changes over the decades, including expansions, renovations, and the 10
addition of running water, plumbing, and electricity, but poor 11
maintenance and neglect brought it to the brink of dereliction. 12
Fortunately, the building was saved from destruction and carefully 13
restored over the course of more than four decades, and it now stands 14
as an example of the rich heritage of bygone days; and 15
WHEREAS, The spirit of our nation is founded upon, and reflected 16
in, its exciting and colorful past, and the memorializing of 17
significant landmarks and artifacts is vital to the preservation of 18
America’s unique heritage. Indeed, the continued longevity of Hotel 19
Lakeside is a justifiable source of pride and an outstanding 20
reflection on the many people who have supported its refurbishing, 21
including its board of trustees and the Friends of Hotel Lakeside, and 22
on the entire community; and 23
WHEREAS, The conservation of the Hotel Lakeside building can be 24
attributed to the vision and foresight of a host of innovative 25
individuals, and all those who have been involved with the 26

rededication are to be applauded on their tremendous efforts. Indeed, 27
the preservation of this one-of-a-kind edifice convincingly 28
demonstrates how very much can be accomplished by a group of 29
conscientious people with clear objectives and firm resolve, and it is 30
through the work of citizens such as these that Ohio continues to be a 31
pleasant place in which to live; therefore be it 32
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the Senate of the 136th General 33
Assembly of Ohio, in adopting this Resolution, commend Hotel Lakeside 34
on its One Hundred Fiftieth Anniversary and extend best wishes for the 35
future; and be it further 36
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit a duly 37
authenticated copy of this Resolution to Hotel Lakeside. 38
