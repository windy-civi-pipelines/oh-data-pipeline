submitting a plat to alter the plat or any part of it as a 226
condition for approval, as long as the plat is in accordance 227
with the general rules governing plats and subdivisions of land, 228
adopted as provided in this section, in effect at the time the 229
plat was submitted. The ground of refusal or approval of any 230
plat submitted, including citation of or reference to the rule 231
violated by the plat, shall be stated upon the record of the 232
commission, commissioner, or legislative authority. Within sixty 233
days after refusal, the person submitting any plat that the 234
commission, commissioner, or legislative authority refuses to 235
approve may file a petition in the court of common pleas of the 236
proper county, in which the person shall be named plaintiff. The 237
petition shall contain a copy of the plat sought to be recorded, 238
a statement of the facts justifying the propriety and 239
reasonableness of the proposed subdivision, and a prayer for an 240
order directed to the recorder to record the plat and may 241
include a statement of facts to support a claim that the rules 242
of the planning authority under which it refused to approve the 243
plat are unreasonable or unlawful. The planning authority 244
refusing to approve the plat and the recorder of the county 245
shall be joined as defendants and summons shall be issued upon 246
those defendants as in civil actions. Within the rule day 247
provided for a civil action, the planning authority may file an 248
answer in which it may set forth a statement of the facts 249
justifying its refusal to approve the plat, a copy of its rule 250
under which it refused to approve the plat, and a statement of 251
the facts supporting the reasonableness and lawfulness of that 252
rule. The court shall hear the matter upon such evidence as is 253
introduced by either party and the planning authority may 254
introduce as a part of its case a complete transcript of any 255
proceedings had before it. Any detail of the plat may be 256
modified upon motion of the plaintiff before the cause is 257

submitted to the court. If the court finds that the prayer for 258
the recording of the plat or any modification of it as may be 259
agreed to or proposed by the plaintiff, is supported by a 260
preponderance of the evidence, it shall enter an order directed 261
to the recorder to record the plat as originally submitted or as 262
agreed to be modified. Otherwise, the petition shall be 263
dismissed. The court shall return a separate finding upon the 264
reasonableness and lawfulness of the refusal to approve the plat 265
or upon the reasonableness and lawfulness of the rule under 266
which the planning authority refused to approve the plat or 267
both, as the case may require. The judgment or order of the 268
court may be appealed by either party on questions of law as in 269
other civil cases. 270
The planning commission, platting commissioner, or 271
legislative authority of a village may adopt general rules 272
governing plats and subdivisions of land falling within its 273
jurisdiction in order to secure and provide for the coordination 274
of the streets within the subdivision with existing streets and 275
roads or with the plan or plats of the municipal corporation, 276
for the proper amount of open spaces for traffic, circulation, 277
and utilities, and for the avoidance of future congestion of 278
population detrimental to the public health or safety but shall 279
not impose a greater minimum lot area than forty-eight hundred 280
square feet. The rules may provide for their modification by the 281
planning commission in specific cases where unusual 282
topographical or other exceptional conditions require the 283
modification. The rules may require the county department of 284
health to review and comment on a plat before the planning 285
commission, platting commissioner, or legislative authority of a 286
village acts upon it and may also require proof of compliance 287
with any applicable zoning resolutions as a basis for approval 288

of a plat. 289
However, no city or village planning commission shall 290
adopt any rules requiring actual construction of streets or 291
other improvements or facilities or assurance of that 292
construction as a condition precedent to the approval of a plat 293
of a subdivision unless the requirements have first been adopted 294
by the legislative authority of the city or village after a 295
public hearing. The rules shall be promulgated and published as 296
provided by sections 731.17 to 731.42 of the Revised Code, and 297
before adoption a public hearing shall be held on the adoption 298
and a copy of the rules shall be certified by the commission, 299
commissioner, or legislative authority to the county recorder of 300
the county in which the municipal corporation is located. 301
In the exercise of any power over or concerning the 302
platting and subdivision of land or the recording of plats of 303
subdivisions by a city, county, regional, or other planning 304
commission pursuant to any other section of the Revised Code, 305
the provisions of this section with respect to appeals from a 306
decision of a planning commission apply to the decision of any 307
such commission in the exercise of any power of that kind 308
granted by any other section of the Revised Code in addition to 309
any other remedy of appeal granted by the Revised Code. When a 310
plan has been adopted as provided in this section, the approval 311
of plats shall be in lieu of the approvals provided for by any 312
other section of the Revised Code, so far as territory within 313
the approving jurisdiction of the commission, commissioner, or 314
legislative authority, as provided in this section, is 315
concerned. Approval of a plat shall not be an acceptance by the 316
public of the dedication of any street, highway, or other way or 317
open space shown upon the plat. 318

commission, commissioner, or legislative authority of the 197

(2) Division (B)(1) of this section does not apply to any 199

planning commission as provided in section 711.10 of the Revised 210
Code. 211

commissioner, or the legislative authority of a village required 213

plat for approval or within such further time as the applying 216
party may agree to; otherwise that plat is deemed approved, and 217

As Introduced
submitting a plat to alter the plat or any part of it as a 226
condition for approval, as long as the plat is in accordance 227
with the general rules governing plats and subdivisions of land, 228
adopted as provided in this section, in effect at the time the 229
plat was submitted. The ground of refusal or approval of any 230
plat submitted, including citation of or reference to the rule 231
violated by the plat, shall be stated upon the record of the 232
commission, commissioner, or legislative authority. Within sixty 233
days after refusal, the person submitting any plat that the 234
commission, commissioner, or legislative authority refuses to 235
approve may file a petition in the court of common pleas of the 236
proper county, in which the person shall be named plaintiff. The 237
petition shall contain a copy of the plat sought to be recorded, 238
a statement of the facts justifying the propriety and 239
reasonableness of the proposed subdivision, and a prayer for an 240
order directed to the recorder to record the plat and may 241
include a statement of facts to support a claim that the rules 242
of the planning authority under which it refused to approve the 243
plat are unreasonable or unlawful. The planning authority 244
refusing to approve the plat and the recorder of the county 245
shall be joined as defendants and summons shall be issued upon 246
those defendants as in civil actions. Within the rule day 247
provided for a civil action, the planning authority may file an 248
answer in which it may set forth a statement of the facts 249
justifying its refusal to approve the plat, a copy of its rule 250
under which it refused to approve the plat, and a statement of 251
the facts supporting the reasonableness and lawfulness of that 252
rule. The court shall hear the matter upon such evidence as is 253
introduced by either party and the planning authority may 254
introduce as a part of its case a complete transcript of any 255
proceedings had before it. Any detail of the plat may be 256
modified upon motion of the plaintiff before the cause is 257

As Introduced
submitted to the court. If the court finds that the prayer for 258
the recording of the plat or any modification of it as may be 259
agreed to or proposed by the plaintiff, is supported by a 260
preponderance of the evidence, it shall enter an order directed 261
to the recorder to record the plat as originally submitted or as 262
agreed to be modified. Otherwise, the petition shall be 263
dismissed. The court shall return a separate finding upon the 264
reasonableness and lawfulness of the refusal to approve the plat 265
or upon the reasonableness and lawfulness of the rule under 266
which the planning authority refused to approve the plat or 267
both, as the case may require. The judgment or order of the 268
court may be appealed by either party on questions of law as in 269
other civil cases. 270
The planning commission, platting commissioner, or 271
legislative authority of a village may adopt general rules 272
governing plats and subdivisions of land falling within its 273
jurisdiction in order to secure and provide for the coordination 274
of the streets within the subdivision with existing streets and 275
roads or with the plan or plats of the municipal corporation, 276
for the proper amount of open spaces for traffic, circulation, 277
and utilities, and for the avoidance of future congestion of 278
population detrimental to the public health or safety but shall 279
not impose a greater minimum lot area than forty-eight hundred 280
square feet. The rules may provide for their modification by the 281
planning commission in specific cases where unusual 282
topographical or other exceptional conditions require the 283
modification. The rules may require the county department of 284
health to review and comment on a plat before the planning 285
commission, platting commissioner, or legislative authority of a 286
village acts upon it and may also require proof of compliance 287
with any applicable zoning resolutions as a basis for approval 288

of a plat. 289
However, no city or village planning commission shall 290
adopt any rules requiring actual construction of streets or 291
other improvements or facilities or assurance of that 292
construction as a condition precedent to the approval of a plat 293
of a subdivision unless the requirements have first been adopted 294
by the legislative authority of the city or village after a 295
public hearing. The rules shall be promulgated and published as 296
provided by sections 731.17 to 731.42 of the Revised Code, and 297
before adoption a public hearing shall be held on the adoption 298
and a copy of the rules shall be certified by the commission, 299
commissioner, or legislative authority to the county recorder of 300
the county in which the municipal corporation is located. 301
In the exercise of any power over or concerning the 302
platting and subdivision of land or the recording of plats of 303
subdivisions by a city, county, regional, or other planning 304
commission pursuant to any other section of the Revised Code, 305
the provisions of this section with respect to appeals from a 306
decision of a planning commission apply to the decision of any 307
such commission in the exercise of any power of that kind 308
granted by any other section of the Revised Code in addition to 309
any other remedy of appeal granted by the Revised Code. When a 310
plan has been adopted as provided in this section, the approval 311
of plats shall be in lieu of the approvals provided for by any 312
other section of the Revised Code, so far as territory within 313
the approving jurisdiction of the commission, commissioner, or 314
legislative authority, as provided in this section, is 315
concerned. Approval of a plat shall not be an acceptance by the 316
public of the dedication of any street, highway, or other way or 317
open space shown upon the plat. 318

H. B. No. 361 Page 12

(D) This section does not apply to unincorporated 319
territory in any county having five or more cities and having a 320
regional planning commission or county planning commission not 321
included within the geographic boundaries of a regional planning 322
commission, where the regional or county planning commission has 323
determined, by resolution, to exercise the authority granted 324
under section 711.10 of the Revised Code for the unincorporated 325
territory within three miles of cities within that county. 326
Sec. 713.35. (A) As used in this section, "entitlement" 327
means any discretionary land use decision requiring an approval 328
by a public body or elected official, including, but not limited 329
to, a variance, special or conditional use, zoning change, 330
planned unit development, or other special approval. 331
(B) Except as otherwise provided in the Revised Code, 332
every entitlement application shall receive at least one public 333
hearing, which shall occur not later than thirty days after the 334
entitlement application is submitted, and every entitlement 335
application shall be resolved via approval or denial not more 336
than ninety days after the application is filed. This section 337
does not apply if an application is deviated from the original 338
submission. The municipal board or commission conducting the 339
hearing shall provide notice of the hearing not less than 340
fourteen days before the hearing, as follows: 341

Sec. 3781.10. (A)(1) The board of building standards shall 355
formulate and adopt rules governing the erection, construction, 356
repair, alteration, and maintenance of all buildings or classes 357
of buildings specified in section 3781.06 of the Revised Code, 358
including land area incidental to those buildings, the 359
construction of industrialized units, the installation of 360
equipment, and the standards or requirements for materials used 361
in connection with those buildings. The board shall incorporate 362
those rules into separate residential and nonresidential 363
building codes. The standards shall relate to the conservation 364
of energy and the safety and sanitation of those buildings. 365
(2) The rules governing nonresidential buildings are the 366
lawful minimum requirements specified for those buildings and 367
industrialized units, except that no rule other than as provided 368
in division (C) of section 3781.108 of the Revised Code that 369
specifies a higher requirement than is imposed by any section of 370
the Revised Code is enforceable. The rules governing residential 371
buildings are uniform requirements for residential buildings in 372
any area with a building department certified to enforce the 373
state residential building code. In no case shall any local code 374
or regulation differ from the state residential building code 375
unless that code or regulation addresses subject matter not 376
addressed by the state residential building code or is adopted 377
pursuant to section 3781.01 of the Revised Code. 378

the extent necessary or desirable to effectuate the purposes of 386
sections 3781.06 to 3781.18 of the Revised Code. 387
(B) The board shall report to the general assembly 388
proposals for amendments to existing statutes relating to the 389
purposes declared in section 3781.06 of the Revised Code that 390
public health and safety and the development of the arts require 391

township may not adopt regulations authorized by this division 757
until the date that is one year after the effective date of this 758
section October 24, 2002, and then only if the county does not 759

used for the approval or denial of a permit. Any regulations 781
regarding the approval or denial of a permit shall specify a 782
reasonable period for the approval or denial and shall provide 783
that a failure to approve or deny, in whole or in part, any 784
permit, license, or other approval sought within that period 785

(A) of this section for adopting regulations under that 794
division, the board of township trustees of a township other 795

that division. If such a board of township trustees adopts 797
regulations, and a board of county commissioners later adopts 798
regulations under division (B) of this section that apply to the 799
same township roads, then, one year after the effective date of 800
the county regulations, the regulations adopted by the board of 801
township trustees shall be void, and the regulations adopted by 802
the board of county commissioners shall apply to those township 803
roads. However, the board of township trustees may establish an 804
earlier date for the county regulations to take effect and the 805
township regulations to be void by adopting a resolution 806
establishing an earlier date and sending a certified copy of 807
that resolution to the board of county commissioners. 808
(D) Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an 809
urban township adopts regulations under division (A) of this 810
section and the county also adopts regulations under division 811
(B) of this section that affect township roads in that township, 812
the county regulations shall have no effect on the township 813
roads in that township. If the urban township adopts its 814
regulations after the county adopts its regulations, however, 815
the county regulations shall remain in effect for one year after 816
the township regulations are adopted unless the board of county 817
commissioners establishes an earlier date for the county 818
regulations to expire within that urban township. After the 819
earlier established date or one year, whichever is applicable, 820
only the township regulations shall apply to the township roads 821
in that urban township, although the county regulations shall 822
continue to apply to the county roads in that urban township. 823
