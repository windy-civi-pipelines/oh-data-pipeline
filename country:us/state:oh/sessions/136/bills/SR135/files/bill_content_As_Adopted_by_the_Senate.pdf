WHEREAS, The Logan County Fair is deserving of acknowledgement, 4
for its success has made it one of the best summer events for family 5

from these humble beginnings, it has grown to become an expansive 7
event that has served as a true source of pride over the years; and 8

opportunity for local citizens to showcase their community by 10
featuring a wide variety of food, rides, performances, agricultural 11
and horticultural exhibits, and livestock shows. In providing a fun 12
and exciting atmosphere, the fine people of Logan County have been 13
instrumental to the success of this exemplary annual gathering; and 14
WHEREAS, The Logan County Fair has become distinguished as one of 15
Ohioâ€™s finest events, and we are certain that as it continues to grow 16
and prosper, it will maintain its unfaltering dedication to advancing 17
the field of agriculture. Indeed, the tradition of excellence that has 18
come to represent the fair has, most assuredly, been the hallmark of 19
this community tradition through the passage of time; therefore be it 20
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the Senate of the 136th General 21
Assembly of Ohio, in adopting this Resolution, congratulate the Logan 22
County Fair on its 2025 season and salute all those who have made this 23
