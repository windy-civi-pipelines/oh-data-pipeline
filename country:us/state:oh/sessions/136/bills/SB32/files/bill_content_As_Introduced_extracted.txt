together with the employee's employer, shall submit an 42

of this section remains valid as long as the employee, employer, 68
and child care provider continue to satisfy the eligibility 69
conditions described in division (C) of this section. 70

has committed fraud, misrepresentation, or deception in applying 72

or to continue to participate, in the program. 75
