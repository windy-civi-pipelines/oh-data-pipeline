1545.21, 3316.041, 3316.06, 3358.11, 3505.06, 5705.03, 5705.218, 9
5705.2111, 5705.221, 5705.233, 5705.261, and 5705.412 of the 10
Revised Code be amended to read as follows: 11
Sec. 319.301. (A) The reductions required by division (D) 12
of this section do not apply to any of the following: 13
(1) Taxes levied at whatever rate is required to produce a 14
specified amount of tax money, including a tax levied under 15
section 5705.199 or 5748.09 of the Revised Code, or an amount to 16
pay debt charges; 17

H. B. No. 28 Page 2
As Introduced
(2) Taxes levied within the one per cent limitation 18
imposed by Section 2 of Article XII, Ohio Constitution; 19
(3) Taxes provided for by the charter of a municipal 20
corporation. 21
(B) As used in this section: 22
(1) "Real property" includes real property owned by a 23
railroad. 24
(2) "Carryover property" means all real property on the 25
current year's tax list except: 26
(a) Land and improvements that were not taxed by the 27
district in both the preceding year and the current year; 28
(b) Land and improvements that were not in the same class 29
in both the preceding year and the current year. 30
(3) "Effective tax rate" means with respect to each class 31
of property: 32
(a) The sum of the total taxes that would have been 33
charged and payable for current expenses against real property 34
in that class if each of the district's taxes were reduced for 35
the current year under division (D)(1) of this section without 36
regard to the application of division (E)(3) of this section 37
divided by 38
(b) The taxable value of all real property in that class. 39
(4) "Taxes charged and payable" means the taxes charged 40
and payable prior to any reduction required by section 319.302 41
of the Revised Code. 42
(C) The tax commissioner shall make the determinations 43
required by this section each year, without regard to whether a 44

H. B. No. 28 Page 3
As Introduced
taxing district has territory in a county to which section 45
5715.24 of the Revised Code applies for that year. Separate 46
determinations shall be made for each of the two classes 47
established pursuant to section 5713.041 of the Revised Code. 48
(D) With respect to each tax authorized to be levied by 49
each taxing district, the tax commissioner, annually, shall do 50
both of the following: 51
(1) Determine by what percentage, if any, the sums levied 52
by such tax against the carryover property in each class would 53
have to be reduced for the tax to levy the same number of 54
dollars against such property in that class in the current year 55
as were charged against such property by such tax in the 56
preceding year subsequent to the reduction made under this 57
section but before the reduction made under section 319.302 of 58
the Revised Code. In the case of a tax levied for the first time 59
that is not a renewal of an existing tax, the commissioner shall 60
determine by what percentage the sums that would otherwise be 61
levied by such tax against carryover property in each class 62
would have to be reduced to equal the amount that would have 63
been levied if the full rate thereof had been imposed against 64
the total taxable value of such property in the preceding tax 65
year. A tax or portion of a tax that is designated a replacement 66
levy under section 5705.192 of the Revised Code is not a renewal 67
of an existing tax for purposes of this division. 68
(2) Certify each percentage determined in division (D)(1) 69
of this section, as adjusted under division (E) of this section, 70
and the class of property to which that percentage applies to 71
the auditor of each county in which the district has territory. 72
The auditor, after complying with section 319.30 of the Revised 73
Code, shall reduce the sum to be levied by such tax against each 74

H. B. No. 28 Page 4
As Introduced
parcel of real property in the district by the percentage so 75
certified for its class. Certification shall be made by the 76
first day of September except in the case of a tax levied for 77
the first time, in which case certification shall be made within 78
fifteen days of the date the county auditor submits the 79
information necessary to make the required determination. 80
(E)(1) As used in division (E)(2) of this section, "pre- 81
1982 joint vocational taxes" means, with respect to a class of 82
property, the difference between the following amounts: 83
(a) The taxes charged and payable in tax year 1981 against 84
the property in that class for the current expenses of the joint 85
vocational school district of which the school district is a 86
part after making all reductions under this section; 87
(b) Two-tenths of one per cent of the taxable value of all 88
real property in that class. 89
If the amount in division (E)(1)(b) of this section 90
exceeds the amount in division (E)(1)(a) of this section, the 91
pre-1982 joint vocational taxes shall be zero. 92
As used in divisions (E)(2) and (3) of this section, 93
"taxes charged and payable" has the same meaning as in division 94
(B)(4) of this section and excludes any tax charged and payable 95
in 1985 or thereafter under sections 5705.194 to 5705.197 or 96
section 5705.199, 5705.213, 5705.219, or 5748.09 of the Revised 97
Code. 98
(2) If in the case of a school district other than a joint 99
vocational or cooperative education school district any 100
percentage required to be used in division (D)(2) of this 101
section for either class of property could cause the total taxes 102
charged and payable for current expenses to be less than two per 103

H. B. No. 28 Page 5
As Introduced
cent of the taxable value of all real property in that class 104
that is subject to taxation by the district, the commissioner 105
shall determine what percentages would cause the district's 106
total taxes charged and payable for current expenses against 107
that class, after all reductions that would otherwise be made 108
under this section, to equal, when combined with the pre-1982 109
joint vocational taxes against that class, the lesser of the 110
following: 111
(a) The sum of the rates at which those taxes are 112
authorized to be levied; 113
(b) Two per cent of the taxable value of the property in 114
that class. The auditor shall use such percentages in making the 115
reduction required by this section for that class. 116
(3) If in the case of a joint vocational school district 117
any percentage required to be used in division (D)(2) of this 118
section for either class of property could cause the total taxes 119
charged and payable for current expenses for that class to be 120
less than two-tenths of one per cent of the taxable value of 121
that class, the commissioner shall determine what percentages 122
would cause the district's total taxes charged and payable for 123
current expenses for that class, after all reductions that would 124
otherwise be made under this section, to equal that amount. The 125
auditor shall use such percentages in making the reductions 126
required by this section for that class. 127
(F) No reduction shall be made under this section in the 128
rate at which any tax is levied. 129
(G) The commissioner may order a county auditor to furnish 130
any information the commissioner needs to make the 131
determinations required under division (D) or (E) of this 132

H. B. No. 28 Page 6
As Introduced
section, and the auditor shall supply the information in the 133
form and by the date specified in the order. If the auditor 134
fails to comply with an order issued under this division, except 135
for good cause as determined by the commissioner, the 136
commissioner shall withhold from such county or taxing district 137
therein fifty per cent of state revenues to local governments 138
pursuant to section 5747.50 of the Revised Code or shall direct 139
the department of education and workforce to withhold therefrom 140
fifty per cent of state revenues to school districts pursuant to 141
Chapter 3317. of the Revised Code. The commissioner shall 142
withhold the distribution of such revenues until the county 143
auditor has complied with this division, and the department 144
shall withhold the distribution of such revenues until the 145
commissioner has notified the department that the county auditor 146
has complied with this division. 147
(H) If the commissioner is unable to certify a tax 148
reduction factor for either class of property in a taxing 149
district located in more than one county by the last day of 150
November because information required under division (G) of this 151
section is unavailable, the commissioner may compute and certify 152
an estimated tax reduction factor for that district for that 153
class. The estimated factor shall be based upon an estimate of 154
the unavailable information. Upon receipt of the actual 155
information for a taxing district that received an estimated tax 156
reduction factor, the commissioner shall compute the actual tax 157
reduction factor and use that factor to compute the taxes that 158
should have been charged and payable against each parcel of 159
property for the year for which the estimated reduction factor 160
was used. The amount by which the estimated factor resulted in 161
an overpayment or underpayment in taxes on any parcel shall be 162
added to or subtracted from the amount due on that parcel in the 163

H. B. No. 28 Page 7
As Introduced
ensuing tax year. 164
A percentage or a tax reduction factor determined or 165
computed by the commissioner under this section shall be used 166
solely for the purpose of reducing the sums to be levied by the 167
tax to which it applies for the year for which it was determined 168
or computed. It shall not be used in making any tax computations 169
for any ensuing tax year. 170
(I) In making the determinations under division (D)(1) of 171
this section, the tax commissioner shall take account of changes 172
in the taxable value of carryover property resulting from 173
complaints filed under section 5715.19 of the Revised Code for 174
determinations made for the tax year in which such changes are 175
reported to the commissioner. Such changes shall be reported to 176
the commissioner on the first abstract of real property filed 177
with the commissioner under section 5715.23 of the Revised Code 178
following the date on which the complaint is finally determined 179
by the board of revision or by a court or other authority with 180
jurisdiction on appeal. The tax commissioner shall account for 181
such changes in making the determinations only for the tax year 182
in which the change in valuation is reported. Such a valuation 183
change shall not be used to recompute the percentages determined 184
under division (D)(1) of this section for any prior tax year. 185
Sec. 319.302. (A)(1) Real property that is not intended 186
primarily for use in a business activity shall qualify for a 187
partial exemption from real property taxation. For purposes of 188
this partial exemption, "business activity" includes all uses of 189
real property, except farming; leasing property for farming; 190
occupying or holding property improved with single-family, two- 191
family, or three-family dwellings; leasing property improved 192
with single-family, two-family, or three-family dwellings; or 193

H. B. No. 28 Page 8
As Introduced
holding vacant land that the county auditor determines will be 194
used for farming or to develop single-family, two-family, or 195
three-family dwellings. For purposes of this partial exemption, 196
"farming" does not include land used for the commercial 197
production of timber that is receiving the tax benefit under 198
section 5713.23 or 5713.31 of the Revised Code and all 199
improvements connected with such commercial production of 200
timber. 201
(2) Each year, the county auditor shall review each parcel 202
of real property to determine whether it qualifies for the 203
partial exemption provided for by this section as of the first 204
day of January of the current tax year. 205
(B) After complying with section 319.301 of the Revised 206
Code, the county auditor shall reduce the remaining sums to be 207
levied by qualifying levies against each parcel of real property 208
that is listed on the general tax list and duplicate of real and 209
public utility property for the current tax year and that 210
qualifies for partial exemption under division (A) of this 211
section, and against each manufactured and mobile home that is 212
taxed pursuant to division (D)(2) of section 4503.06 of the 213
Revised Code and that is on the manufactured home tax list for 214
the current tax year, by ten per cent, to provide a partial 215
exemption for that parcel or home. For the purposes of this 216
division: 217
(1) "Qualifying levy" means a levy approved at an election 218
held before September 29, 2013; a levy within the ten-mill 219
limitation; a levy provided for by the charter of a municipal 220
corporation that was levied on the tax list for tax year 2013; a 221
subsequent renewal of any such levy; or a subsequent substitute 222
for such a levy under section 5705.199 of the Revised Code. 223

H. B. No. 28 Page 9
As Introduced
(2) "Qualifying levy" does not include any replacement 224
imposed under section 5705.192 of the Revised Code, as it 225
existed before the effective date of this amendment, of any levy 226
described in division (B)(1) of this section. 227
(C) Except as otherwise provided in sections 323.152, 228
323.158, 323.16, 505.06, and 715.263 of the Revised Code, the 229
amount of the taxes remaining after any such reduction shall be 230
the real and public utility property taxes charged and payable 231
on each parcel of real property, including property that does 232
not qualify for partial exemption under division (A) of this 233
section, and the manufactured home tax charged and payable on 234
each manufactured or mobile home, and shall be the amounts 235
certified to the county treasurer for collection. Upon receipt 236
of the real and public utility property tax duplicate, the 237
treasurer shall certify to the tax commissioner the total amount 238
by which the real property taxes were reduced under this 239
section, as shown on the duplicate. Such reduction shall not 240
directly or indirectly affect the determination of the principal 241
amount of notes that may be issued in anticipation of any tax 242
levies or the amount of bonds or notes for any planned 243
improvements. If after application of sections 5705.31 and 244
5705.32 of the Revised Code and other applicable provisions of 245
law, including divisions (F) and (I) of section 321.24 of the 246
Revised Code, there would be insufficient funds for payment of 247
debt charges on bonds or notes payable from taxes reduced by 248
this section, the reduction of taxes provided for in this 249
section shall be adjusted to the extent necessary to provide 250
funds from such taxes. 251
(D) The tax commissioner may adopt rules governing the 252
administration of the partial exemption provided for by this 253
section. 254

H. B. No. 28 Page 10
As Introduced
(E) The determination of whether property qualifies for 255
partial exemption under division (A) of this section is solely 256
for the purpose of allowing the partial exemption under division 257
(B) of this section. 258
Sec. 523.06. If a merger agreement is entered into as 259
required by section 523.04 of the Revised Code, this section 260
does not apply. If a merger agreement is not entered into under 261
section 523.04 of the Revised Code, the merger agreement shall 262
contain all of the terms and conditions specified in this 263
section. If a partial merger agreement is entered into under 264
section 523.04 of the Revised Code, this section applies only to 265
the extent any term or condition that is required by section 266
523.04 of the Revised Code to be addressed in the merger 267
agreement is not addressed therein. 268
The terms and conditions of a merger agreement to which 269
this section applies shall be as follows: 270
(A) All members of each board of township trustees shall 271
serve as board members of the new township. At the first general 272
election for township officers occurring not less than ninety 273
days after a merger is approved, the electors of the new 274
township shall elect three township trustees with staggered 275
terms of office. The first terms of office following the 276
election shall be modified to an even number of years not to 277
exceed four to allow subsequent elections for the office to be 278
held in the same year as other township officers. 279
(B) The township fiscal officer of the largest township, 280
by population, shall be the township fiscal officer for the new 281
township. At the first general election for township officers 282
occurring not less than ninety days after the merger, the 283
electors shall elect a township fiscal officer, whose first term 284

H. B. No. 28 Page 11
As Introduced
of office shall be modified to an even number of years not to 285
exceed four to allow subsequent elections for that office to be 286
held in the same year as other township fiscal officers. 287
(C) Voted property tax levies shall remain in effect for 288
the parcels of real property to which they applied prior to the 289
merger, and the merger shall not affect the proceeds of a tax 290
levy pledged for the retirement of any debt obligation. Upon 291
expiration of a property tax levy, the levy may only be replaced 292
or renewed by vote of the electors in the manner provided by 293
law, to apply to real property within the boundaries of the new 294
township. If the millage levied inside the ten-mill limitation 295
of each township merged is different, the board of township 296
trustees of the new township shall immediately equalize the 297
millage for the entire new township. 298
(D) For purposes of the retirement of all debt obligations 299
of each township merged, the township fiscal officer shall 300
continue to track parcels of real property and the tax revenue 301
generated on those parcels by the tax districts that were in 302
place prior to the merger, and shall provide that information on 303
an annual basis to the board of township trustees of the new 304
township. Debt obligations that existed at the time of the 305
merger shall be retired from the revenue generated from the 306
parcels of real property that made up the township that incurred 307
the debt before the merger. 308
(E)(1) With respect to any agreement entered into under 309
Chapter 4117. of the Revised Code that covers any of the 310
employees of the townships merged under this chapter, the state 311
employment relations board, within one hundred twenty days after 312
the date the merger is approved, shall designate the appropriate 313
bargaining units for the employees of the new township in 314

As Introduced
accordance with section 4117.06 of the Revised Code. 315
Notwithstanding the recognition procedures prescribed in section 316
4117.05 and division (A) of section 4117.07 of the Revised Code, 317
the board shall conduct a representation election with respect 318
to each bargaining unit designated under this division in 319
accordance with divisions (B) and (C) of section 4117.07 of the 320
Revised Code. If an exclusive representative is selected through 321
this election, the exclusive representative shall negotiate and 322
enter into an agreement with the new township in accordance with 323
Chapter 4117. of the Revised Code. Until the parties reach an 324
agreement, any agreement in effect on the date of the merger 325
shall apply to the employees that were in the bargaining unit 326
that is covered by the agreement. An agreement in existence on 327
the date of the merger is terminated on the effective date of an 328
agreement negotiated under this division. 329
(2) If an exclusive representative is not selected, any 330
agreement in effect on the date of the merger shall apply to the 331
employees that were in the bargaining unit that is covered by 332
the agreement and shall expire on its terms. 333
(3) Each agreement entered into under Chapter 4117. of the 334
Revised Code on or after the effective date of this section 335
September 29, 2011, involving a new township shall contain a 336
provision regarding the designation of an exclusive 337
representative and bargaining units for the new township as 338
described in division (E) of this section. 339
(4) In addition to the laws listed in division (A) of 340
section 4117.10 of the Revised Code that prevail over 341
conflicting agreements between employee organizations and public 342
employers, division (E) of this section prevails over any 343
conflicting provisions of agreements between employee 344

H. B. No. 28 Page 13
As Introduced
organizations and public employers that are entered into on or 345
after the effective date of this section September 29, 2011, 346
pursuant to Chapter 4117. of the Revised Code. 347
(5) As used in division (E) of this section, "employee 348
organization" and "exclusive representative" have the same 349
meanings as in section 4117.01 of the Revised Code. 350
(F)(1) If the boundaries of the new township are not 351
coextensive with a special purpose district, the new township 352
shall remain in the existing special purpose district as a 353
successor to the original township, unless the special purpose 354
district is dissolved. The board of township trustees of the new 355
township may place a question on the ballot at the next general 356
election held after the merger to conform the boundaries, 357
dissolve the special purpose district, or absorb the special 358
purpose district into the new township on the terms specified in 359
the resolution that places the question on the ballot for 360
approval of the electors of the new township. 361
(2) As used in division (F) of this section, "special 362
purpose district" means any geographic or political jurisdiction 363
that is created under law by a township merged. 364
(G) Zoning codes that existed at the time of the merger 365
shall remain in effect after the merger, and the townships that 366
existed before the merger shall be treated as administrative 367
districts within the new township for the purposes of zoning. 368
Sec. 1545.21. (A) The board of park commissioners, by 369
resolution, may submit to the electors of the park district the 370
question of levying taxes for the use of the district. The 371
resolution shall declare the necessity of levying such taxes, 372
shall specify the purpose for which such taxes shall be used, 373

H. B. No. 28 Page 14
As Introduced
the annual rate proposed, and the number of consecutive years 374
the rate shall be levied. Such resolution shall be forthwith 375
certified to the board of elections in each county in which any 376
part of such district is located, not later than the ninetieth 377
day before the day of the election, and the question of the levy 378
of taxes as provided in such resolution shall be submitted to 379
the electors of the district at a special election to be held on 380
whichever of the following occurs first: 381
(1) The day of the next general election; 382
(2) The first Tuesday after the first Monday in May in any 383
calendar year, except that if a presidential primary election is 384
held in that calendar year, then the day of that election. 385
A resolution to renew, renew and increase, or renew and 386
decrease any existing levy shall not be placed on the ballot 387
unless the question is submitted at the general election held 388
during the last year the tax to be renewed may be extended on 389
the tax list, or at any election described in division (A)(1) or 390
(2) of this section in the ensuing year. Such a resolution may 391
specify that the renewal, increase, or decrease of the existing 392
levy shall be extended on the tax list for the tax year 393
specified in the resolution, which may be the last year the 394
existing levy may be extended on the list for the ensuing year. 395
If the renewal, increase, or decrease is to be extended on the 396
tax list for the last tax year the existing levy would otherwise 397
be extended, the existing levy shall not be extended on the tax 398
list for that last year unless the question of the renewal, 399
increase, or decrease is not approved by a majority of electors 400
voting on the question, in which case the existing levy shall be 401
extended on the tax list for that last year. 402
Except as otherwise prescribed in division (B) of this 403

section, the ballot shall set forth the purpose for which the 404
taxes shall be levied, the levy's estimated annual collections, 405
the annual rate of levy, expressed in mills for each dollar of 406
taxable value and in dollars for each one hundred thousand 407
dollars of the county auditor's appraised value, and the number 408
of years of such levy. If the tax is to be placed on the current 409
tax list, the form of the ballot shall state that the tax will 410
be levied in the current tax year and shall indicate the first 411
calendar year the tax will be due. 412
(B)(1) (B) If the resolution of the board of park 413
commissioners provides that an existing levy will be renewed, 414
increased, or decreased upon the passage of the ballot question, 415
the form of the ballot shall be the same as prescribed for such 416
levies in divisions (B) and (C) of section 5705.25 of the 417
Revised Code. 418
(2) If the resolution of the board of park commissioners 419
provides that an existing levy will be canceled upon the passage 420
of the new levy, the board shall request that the county 421
auditor, in addition to the information the auditor is required 422
to certify under section 5705.03 of the Revised Code, certify 423
the estimated effective rate of the existing levy. In such an 424
instance, the ballot must include a statement that: "an existing 425
levy of ___ mills (stating the original levy millage) for each 426

collected, shall be applied in payment of the bonds so issued 451
and the interest thereon. The amount of bonds so issued and 452
outstanding at any time shall not exceed one per cent of the 453
total taxable value in such district. Such bonds shall bear 454
interest at a rate not to exceed the rate determined as provided 455
in section 9.95 of the Revised Code. 456

school district during the period of fiscal emergency, and shall 543
enumerate respectively, the powers and duties of the commission 544
and the powers and duties of the school board during that 545

obligations that will be issued, together with assurances that 559
any such debt obligations that will be issued will not exceed 560

updated on or after April 10, 2001, unless the director has 609
approved it. 610

the ballot from top to bottom as provided in division (B)(1) of 707
this section, except as otherwise provided in division (B)(2) of 708
this section. State questions and issues shall always appear as 709
the top group of questions and issues. In calendar year 1997, 710
the following questions and issues shall be grouped together on 711
the ballot, in the following order from top to bottom, after the 712
state questions and issues: 713
(a) County questions and issues; 714

this section shall be moved down one place on the ballot except 720
that the group that was last on the ballot during the 721
immediately preceding calendar year shall appear at the top of 722

the first election held during the calendar year. The rotation 725
of groups of questions and issues shall be performed during each 726
calendar year as required by division (B)(1) of this section, 727

be determined by, and certified to each board of elections by, 740
the secretary of state. 741
(3) Failure of the board of elections to rotate questions 742
and issues as required by division (B)(1) of this section does 743
not affect the validity of the election at which the failure 744
occurred, and is not grounds for contesting an election under 745
section 3515.08 of the Revised Code. 746
(C) The particular order in which each of a group of 747
county, municipal, township, or school district questions or 748

issue on the ballot shall be enclosed at the top and bottom 752
thereof by a heavy horizontal line across the width of the 753
ballot. Immediately below such top line shall be printed a brief 754
title descriptive of the question or issue below it, such as 755
"Proposed Constitutional Amendment," "Proposed Bond Issue," 756
"Proposed Annexation of Territory," "Proposed Increase in Tax 757

necessary for passage," "A majority vote is necessary for 762
passage," or such other brief statement as will be descriptive 763
of the percentage of affirmative votes required. 764
(E) The questions and issues ballot need not contain the 765
full text of the proposal to be voted upon. A condensed text 766
that will properly describe the question, issue, or an amendment 767
proposed by other than the general assembly shall be used as 768
prepared and certified by the secretary of state for state-wide 769
questions or issues or by the board for local questions or 770
issues. If other than a full text is used, the full text of the 771
proposed question, issue, or amendment together with the 772
percentage of affirmative votes necessary for passage as 773
required by law shall be posted in each polling place in some 774
spot that is easily accessible to the voters. 775
(F)(1) Except as otherwise provided in division (F)(2) of 776
this section, each question and issue appearing on the questions 777
and issues ballot may be consecutively numbered. The question or 778
issue determined to appear at the top of the ballot may be 779

November 5, 2024, a state question or issue determined to appear 786
at the top of the ballot shall be designated on the face thereof 787

placed below on the ballot shall be consecutively numbered. For 789
elections occurring after the general election held on November 790

last state question or issue that appeared on the ballot at the 794
immediately preceding election at which a state question or 795
issue appeared on the ballot and all state questions or issues 796
placed below on the ballot shall be consecutively numbered. Such 797
numeral shall be placed below the heavy top horizontal line 798
enclosing such question or issue and to the left of the brief 799
title thereof. Once a state question or issue appears on the 800
ballot designated by the Arabic numeral "500," the state 801
question or issue appearing at the top of the ballot at the 802
immediately following election at which a state question or 803
issue appears on the ballot shall be designated by the Arabic 804
numeral "1." 805

ballot with any other propositions submitted at the same 1706
election other than the election of officers. If a majority of 1707
the qualified electors voting on the question of a decrease at 1708
such election approve the proposed decrease in rate, the result 1709
of the election shall be certified immediately after the canvass 1710

which shall thereupon, after the current year, cease to levy 1712
such increased rate or levy such tax at such reduced rate upon 1713

association library district. If notes have been issued in 1715
anticipation of the collection of such levy, the taxing 1716
authority shall continue to levy and collect under authority of 1717

section 5705.218 of the Revised Code for a continuing period of 1726
time, the rate allocated to the school district and to 1727
partnering community schools shall each be decreased by a number 1728
of mills per dollar that is proportionate to the decrease in the 1729
rate of the levy in proportion to the rate at which the levy was 1730
imposed before the decrease. 1731
Sec. 5705.412. (A) As used in this section, "qualifying 1732

district's five-year forecast under section 5705.391 of the 1735

H. B. No. 28 Page 60
As Introduced
Revised Code will exceed the lesser of the following amounts: 1736
(1) Five hundred thousand dollars; 1737
(2) One per cent of the total revenue to be credited in 1738
the current fiscal year to the district's general fund, as 1739
specified in the district's most recent certificate of estimated 1740
resources certified under section 5705.36 of the Revised Code. 1741
(B)(1) Notwithstanding section 5705.41 of the Revised 1742
Code, no school district shall adopt any appropriation measure, 1743
make any qualifying contract, or increase during any school year 1744
any wage or salary schedule unless there is attached thereto a 1745
certificate, signed as required by this section, that the school 1746
district has in effect the authorization to levy taxes including 1747
the renewal or replacement of existing levies which, when 1748
combined with the estimated revenue from all other sources 1749
available to the district at the time of certification, are 1750
sufficient to provide the operating revenues necessary to enable 1751
the district to maintain all personnel and programs for all the 1752
days set forth in its adopted school calendars for the current 1753
fiscal year and for a number of days in succeeding fiscal years 1754
equal to the number of days instruction was held or is scheduled 1755
for the current fiscal year, as follows: 1756
(a) A certificate attached to an appropriation measure 1757
under this section shall cover only the fiscal year in which the 1758
appropriation measure is effective and shall not consider the 1759
renewal or replacement of an existing levy as the authority to 1760
levy taxes that are subject to appropriation in the current 1761
fiscal year unless the renewal or replacement levy has been 1762
approved by the electors and is subject to appropriation in the 1763
current fiscal year. 1764

H. B. No. 28 Page 61
As Introduced
(b) A certificate attached, in accordance with this 1765
section, to any qualifying contract shall cover the term of the 1766
contract. 1767
(c) A certificate attached under this section to a wage or 1768
salary schedule shall cover the term of the schedule. 1769
If the board of education has not adopted a school 1770
calendar for the school year beginning on the first day of the 1771
fiscal year in which a certificate is required, the certificate 1772
attached to an appropriation measure shall include the number of 1773
days on which instruction was held in the preceding fiscal year 1774
and other certificates required under this section shall include 1775
that number of days for the fiscal year in which the certificate 1776
is required and any succeeding fiscal years that the certificate 1777
must cover. 1778
The certificate shall be signed by the treasurer and 1779
president of the board of education and the superintendent of 1780
the school district, unless the district is in a state of fiscal 1781
emergency declared under Chapter 3316. of the Revised Code. In 1782
that case, the certificate shall be signed by a member of the 1783
district's financial planning and supervision commission who is 1784
designated by the commission for this purpose. 1785
(2) In lieu of the certificate required under division (B) 1786
of this section, an alternative certificate stating the 1787
following may be attached: 1788
(a) The contract is a multi-year contract for materials, 1789
equipment, or nonpayroll services essential to the education 1790
program of the district; 1791
(b) The multi-year contract demonstrates savings over the 1792
duration of the contract as compared to costs that otherwise 1793

H. B. No. 28 Page 62
As Introduced
would have been demonstrated in a single year contract, and the 1794
terms will allow the district to reduce the deficit it is 1795
currently facing in future years as demonstrated in its five- 1796
year forecast adopted in accordance with section 5705.391 of the 1797
Revised Code. 1798
The certificate shall be signed by the treasurer and 1799
president of the board of education and the superintendent of 1800
the school district, unless the district is in a state of fiscal 1801
emergency declared under Chapter 3316. of the Revised Code. In 1802
that case, the certificate shall be signed by a member of the 1803
district's financial planning and supervision commission who is 1804
designated by the commission for this purpose. 1805
(C) Every qualifying contract made or wage or salary 1806
schedule adopted or put into effect without such a certificate 1807
shall be void, and no payment of any amount due thereon shall be 1808
made. 1809
(D) The department of education and workforce and the 1810
auditor of state jointly shall adopt rules governing the methods 1811
by which treasurers, presidents of boards of education, 1812
superintendents, and members of financial planning and 1813
supervision commissions shall estimate revenue and determine 1814
whether such revenue is sufficient to provide necessary 1815
operating revenue for the purpose of making certifications 1816
required by this section. 1817
(E) The auditor of state shall be responsible for 1818
determining whether school districts are in compliance with this 1819
section. At the time a school district is audited pursuant to 1820
section 117.11 of the Revised Code, the auditor of state shall 1821
review each certificate issued under this section since the 1822
district's last audit, and the appropriation measure, contract, 1823

H. B. No. 28 Page 63
As Introduced
or wage and salary schedule to which such certificate was 1824
attached. If the auditor of state determines that a school 1825
district has not complied with this section with respect to any 1826
qualifying contract or wage or salary schedule, the auditor of 1827
state shall notify the prosecuting attorney for the county, the 1828
city director of law, or other chief law officer of the school 1829
district. That officer may file a civil action in any court of 1830
appropriate jurisdiction to seek a declaration that the contract 1831
or wage or salary schedule is void, to recover for the school 1832
district from the payee the amount of payments already made 1833
under it, or both, except that the officer shall not seek to 1834
recover payments made under any collective bargaining agreement 1835
entered into under Chapter 4117. of the Revised Code. If the 1836
officer does not file such an action within one hundred twenty 1837
days after receiving notice of noncompliance from the auditor of 1838
state, any taxpayer may institute the action in the taxpayer's 1839
own name on behalf of the school district. 1840
(F) This section does not apply to any contract or 1841
increase in any wage or salary schedule that is necessary in 1842
order to enable a board of education to comply with division (B) 1843
of section 3317.13 of the Revised Code, provided the contract or 1844
increase does not exceed the amount required to be paid to be in 1845
compliance with such division. 1846
(G) Any officer, employee, or other person who expends or 1847
authorizes the expenditure of any public funds or authorizes or 1848
executes any contract or schedule contrary to this section, 1849
expends or authorizes the expenditure of any public funds on the 1850
void contract or schedule, or issues a certificate under this 1851
section which contains any false statements is liable to the 1852
school district for the full amount paid from the district's 1853
funds on the contract or schedule. The officer, employee, or 1854

H. B. No. 28 Page 64
As Introduced
other person is jointly and severally liable in person and upon 1855
any official bond that the officer, employee, or other person 1856
has given to the school district to the extent of any payments 1857
on the void claim, not to exceed ten thousand dollars. However, 1858
no officer, employee, or other person shall be liable for a 1859
mistaken estimate of available resources made in good faith and 1860
based upon reasonable grounds. If an officer, employee, or other 1861
person is found to have complied with rules jointly adopted by 1862
the department of education and workforce and the auditor of 1863
state under this section governing methods by which revenue 1864
shall be estimated and determined sufficient to provide 1865
necessary operating revenue for the purpose of making 1866
certifications required by this section, the officer, employee, 1867
or other person shall not be liable under this section if the 1868
estimates and determinations made according to those rules do 1869
not, in fact, conform with actual revenue. The prosecuting 1870
attorney of the county, the city director of law, or other chief 1871
law officer of the district shall enforce this liability by 1872
civil action brought in any court of appropriate jurisdiction in 1873
the name of and on behalf of the school district. If the 1874
prosecuting attorney, city director of law, or other chief law 1875
officer of the district fails, upon the written request of any 1876
taxpayer, to institute action for the enforcement of the 1877
liability, the attorney general, or the taxpayer in the 1878
taxpayer's own name, may institute the action on behalf of the 1879
subdivision. 1880
(H) This section does not require the attachment of an 1881
additional certificate beyond that required by section 5705.41 1882
of the Revised Code for current payrolls of, or contracts of 1883
employment with, any employees or officers of the school 1884
district. 1885

H. B. No. 28 Page 65
As Introduced
This section does not require the attachment of a 1886
certificate to a temporary appropriation measure if all of the 1887
following apply: 1888
(1) The amount appropriated does not exceed twenty-five 1889
per cent of the total amount from all sources available for 1890
expenditure from any fund during the preceding fiscal year; 1891
(2) The measure will not be in effect on or after the 1892
thirtieth day following the earliest date on which the district 1893
may pass an annual appropriation measure; 1894
(3) An amended official certificate of estimated resources 1895
for the current year, if required, has not been certified to the 1896
board of education under division (B) of section 5705.36 of the 1897
Revised Code. 1898
Section 2. That existing sections 319.301, 319.302, 1899
523.06, 1545.21, 3316.041, 3316.06, 3358.11, 3505.06, 5705.03, 1900
5705.218, 5705.2111, 5705.221, 5705.233, 5705.261, and 5705.412 1901
of the Revised Code are hereby repealed. 1902
Section 3. That section 5705.192 of the Revised Code is 1903
hereby repealed. 1904
Section 4. (A) The amendment by this act of section 1905
1545.21 of the Revised Code applies to elections held on or 1906
after October 1, 2025. 1907
(B) As used in this division, "former section 5705.192 of 1908
the Revised Code" means section 5705.192 of the Revised Code as 1909
it existed before the effective date of its repeal by this act. 1910
If a taxing authority, as defined in former section 1911
5705.192 of the Revised Code, acts under that section prior to 1912
its repeal by this act to replace an existing levy and submit 1913

H. B. No. 28 Page 66
As Introduced
the question to electors at an election held before October 1, 1914
2025, then a board of elections shall proceed to submit that 1915
question in accordance with that former section, notwithstanding 1916
the effective date of its repeal by this act. No replacement of 1917
a tax proposed under former section 5705.192 of the Revised Code 1918
shall be submitted to electors at an election held on or after 1919
October 1, 2025. 1920
