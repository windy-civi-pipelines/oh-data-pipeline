autism spectrum disorder or another developmental disability, or 11

agencies, the state's public and commercial television and radio 22
broadcasters, and others as determined necessary by the 23

this division that conflicts with any alert code standards that 25
are required by federal law and that govern the naming of 26
emergency alert programs. 27

implemented unless all of the following activation criteria are 29

criteria: 34

(4) There is sufficient descriptive information about the 42
individual and the circumstances surrounding the individual's 43
disappearance to indicate that activation of the alert will help 44
locate the individual. 45

received information that meets the activation criteria set 72
forth in that division immediately. 73
