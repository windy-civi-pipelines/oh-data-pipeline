of the net proceeds of obligations and any residual interest, if 3386
any. Any such assignment and sale shall be irrevocable in 3387
accordance with its terms during the period any obligations 3388
secured by amounts so assigned and sold are outstanding under 3389
the applicable bond proceedings, and shall constitute a 3390
contractual obligation to the holders or owners of those 3391
obligations. Any such assignment and sale shall also be treated 3392
as an absolute transfer and true sale for all purposes, and not 3393
as a pledge or other security interest. The characterization of 3394
any such assignment and sale as a true sale and absolute 3395
transfer shall not be negated or adversely affected by only a 3396
portion of the amounts to be received under the tobacco master 3397
settlement agreement being transferred, the acquisition or 3398
retention by the state of a residual interest, the participation 3399
of any state officer or employee as a member or officer of, or 3400
providing staff support to, the issuing authority, any 3401
responsibility of an officer or employee of the state for 3402
collecting the amounts to be received under the tobacco master 3403

retaining any legal title to or interest in any portion of the 3405
amounts to be received under that agreement for the purpose of 3406
these collection activities, any characterization of the issuing 3407
authority or its obligations for purposes of accounting, 3408
taxation, or securities regulation, or by any other factors 3409
whatsoever. A true sale shall exist under this section 3410
regardless of whether the issuing authority has any recourse 3411
against the state or any other term of the bond proceedings or 3412
the treatment or characterization of the transfer as a financing 3413
for any purpose. Upon and following the assignment and sale, the 3414
state shall not have any right, title, or interest in the 3415
portion of the receipts under the tobacco master settlement 3416
agreement so assigned and sold, other than any residual interest 3417
that may be described in the applicable bond proceedings for 3418
those obligations, and that portion, if any, shall be the 3419
property of the issuing authority and not of the state, and 3420
shall be paid directly to the issuing authority, and shall be 3421
owned, received, held, and disbursed by the issuing authority 3422
and not by the state. 3423
The state may covenant, pledge, and agree in the bond 3424
proceedings, with and for the benefit of the issuing authority, 3425
the holders and owners of obligations, and providers of any 3426
credit enhancement facilities, that it shall: (1) maintain 3427
statutory authority for, and cause to be collected and paid 3428
directly to the issuing authority or its assignee, the pledged 3429
receipts, (2) enforce the rights of the issuing authority to 3430
receive the receipts under the tobacco master settlement 3431
agreement assigned and sold to the issuing authority, (3) not 3432
materially impair the rights of the issuing authority to fulfill 3433
the terms of its agreements with the holders or owners of 3434

outstanding obligations under the bond proceedings, (4) not 3435
materially impair the rights and remedies of the holders or 3436
owners of outstanding obligations or materially impair the 3437
security for those outstanding obligations, and (5) enforce 3438
Chapter 1346. of the Revised Code, the tobacco master settlement 3439
agreement, and the consent decree to effectuate the collection 3440
of the pledged tobacco settlement receipts. The bond proceedings 3441
may provide or authorize the manner for determining material 3442
impairment of the security for any outstanding obligations, 3443
including by assessing and evaluating the pledged receipts in 3444
the aggregate. 3445
As further provided for in division (H) of this section, 3446
the bond proceedings may also include such other covenants, 3447
pledges, and agreements by the state to protect and safeguard 3448
the security and rights of the holders and owners of the 3449
obligations, and of the providers of any credit enhancement 3450
facilities, including, without limiting the generality of the 3451
foregoing, any covenant, pledge, or agreement customary in 3452
transactions involving the issuance of securities the debt 3453
service on which is payable from or secured by amounts received 3454
under the tobacco master settlement agreement. Notwithstanding 3455
any other provision of law, any covenant, pledge, and agreement 3456
of the state, if and when made in the bond proceedings, shall be 3457
controlling and binding upon, and enforceable against the state 3458
in accordance with its terms for so long as any obligations are 3459
outstanding under the applicable bond proceedings. The bond 3460
proceedings may also include limitations on the remedies 3461
available to the issuing authority, the holders and owners of 3462
the obligations, and the providers of any credit enhancement 3463
facilities, including, without limiting the generality of the 3464
foregoing, a provision that those remedies may be limited to 3465

determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that the 3467
state has not enforced Chapter 1346. of the Revised Code, the 3468
tobacco master settlement agreement, or the consent decree as 3469
may have been covenanted or agreed in the bond proceedings under 3470
division (B)(5) of this section. 3471
Nothing in this section or the bond proceedings shall 3472
preclude or limit, or be construed to preclude or limit, the 3473
state from regulating or authorizing or permitting the 3474
regulation of smoking or from taxing and regulating the sale of 3475
cigarettes or other tobacco products, or from defending or 3476
prosecuting cases or other actions relating to the sale or use 3477
of cigarettes or other tobacco products. Except as otherwise may 3478
be agreed in writing by the attorney general, nothing in this 3479

Section 120:
section or the bond proceedings shall modify or limit, or be 3480
construed to modify or limit, the responsibility, power, 3481
judgment, and discretion of the attorney general to protect and 3482

The governor and the director of budget and management, in 3486
consultation with the attorney general, on behalf of the state, 3487
and any member or officer of the issuing authority as authorized 3488

may take any action and execute any documents, including any 3490
purchase and sale agreements, necessary to effect the assignment 3491
and sale and the acceptance of the assignment and title to the 3492
receipts including, providing irrevocable direction to the 3493
escrow agent acting under the tobacco master settlement 3494
agreement to transfer directly to the issuing authority the 3495

other bond proceedings may contain the terms and conditions 3498
established by the state and the issuing authority to carry out 3499
and effectuate the purposes of this section, including, without 3500
limitation, covenants binding the state in favor of the issuing 3501
authority and its assignees and the owners of the obligations. 3502
Any such purchase and sale agreement shall be sufficient to 3503
effectuate such purchase and sale without regard to any other 3504
laws governing other property sales or financial transactions by 3505
the state. 3506
Not later than two years following the date on which there 3507
are no longer any obligations outstanding under the bond 3508
proceedings, all assets of the issuing authority shall vest in 3509
the state, the issuing authority shall execute any necessary 3510
assignments or instruments, including any assignment of any 3511

principal amount of obligations issued under this section shall 3517
not exceed six billion dollars, exclusive of obligations issued 3518
under division (M)(1) of this section to refund, renew, or 3519

(D) Each issue of obligations shall be authorized by 3527
resolution or order of the issuing authority. The bond 3528
proceedings shall provide for or authorize the manner for 3529
determining the principal amount or maximum principal amount of 3530
obligations of an issue, the principal maturity or maturities, 3531
the interest rate or rates, the date of and the dates of payment 3532
of interest on the obligations, their denominations, and the 3533
place or places of payment of debt service which may be within 3534
or outside the state. Unless otherwise provided by law, the 3535
latest principal maturity may not be later than the earlier of 3536
the thirty-first day of December of the fiftieth calendar year 3537
after the year of issuance of the particular obligations or of 3538
the fiftieth calendar year after the year in which the original 3539
obligation to pay was issued or entered into. Sections 9.96, 3540

Section 122:
9.98, 9.981, 9.982, and 9.983 of the Revised Code apply to the 3541
obligations. 3542
The purpose of the obligations may be stated in the bond 3543
proceedings in general terms, such as, as applicable, "paying 3544
costs of capital facilities for a system of common schools" and 3545
"paying costs of facilities for state-supported and state- 3546
assisted institutions of higher education." Unless otherwise 3547
provided in the bond proceedings or in division (C) of this 3548

Section 123:
section, the net proceeds from the issuance of the obligations 3549
shall be paid to the state for deposit into the applicable 3550

Section 125:
section 3318.25 of the Revised Code may be used to pay basic 3561
project costs under that chapter at the times determined by the 3562
Ohio facilities construction commission without regard to 3563
whether those expenditures are in proportion to the state's and 3564
the school district's respective shares of that basic project 3565
cost; provided that this shall not result in any change in the 3566
state or school district shares of the basic project costs as 3567
determined under that chapter. As used in the preceding 3568
sentence, "Ohio facilities construction commission" and "basic 3569
project costs" have the same meanings as in section 3318.01 of 3570
the Revised Code. 3571
(E) The issuing authority may, without need for any other 3572
approval, appoint or provide for the appointment of paying 3573
agents, bond registrars, securities depositories, credit 3574
enhancement providers or counterparties, clearing corporations, 3575

underwriters, investment bankers, financial advisers, accounting 3577
experts, marketing, remarketing, indexing, and administrative 3578
agents, other consultants, and independent contractors, 3579
including printing services, as are necessary in the judgment of 3580
the issuing authority to carry out the issuing authority's 3581
functions under this section and section 183.52 of the Revised 3582
Code. The attorney general as counsel to the issuing authority 3583
shall represent the authority in the execution of its powers and 3584
duties, and shall institute and prosecute all actions on its 3585
behalf. The issuing authority, in consultation with the attorney 3586
general, shall select counsel, and the attorney general shall 3587
appoint the counsel selected, for the purposes of carrying out 3588

the functions under this section and related sections of the 3589
Revised Code. Financing costs are payable, as may be provided in 3590
the bond proceedings, from the proceeds of the obligations, from 3591
special funds, or from other moneys available for the purpose, 3592
including as to future financing costs, from the pledged 3593
receipts. 3594
(F) The issuing authority may irrevocably pledge and 3595
assign all, or such portion as the issuing authority determines, 3596
of the pledged receipts to the payment of the debt service 3597
charges on obligations issued under this section, and for the 3598
establishment and maintenance of any reserves, as provided in 3599
the bond proceedings, and make other provisions in the bond 3600
proceedings with respect to pledged receipts as authorized by 3601
this section, which provisions are controlling notwithstanding 3602
any other provisions of law pertaining to them. Any and all 3603
pledged receipts received by the issuing authority and required 3604
by the bond proceedings, consistent with this section, to be 3605
deposited, transferred, or credited to the bond service fund, 3606
and all other money transferred or allocated to or received for 3607
the purposes of that fund, shall be deposited and credited to 3608
the bond service fund created in the bond proceedings for the 3609
obligations, subject to any applicable provisions of those bond 3610
proceedings, but without necessity for any act of appropriation. 3611
Those pledged receipts shall immediately be subject to the lien 3612
of that pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further 3613
act, and shall not be subject to other court judgments. The lien 3614
of the pledge of those pledged receipts shall be valid and 3615
binding against all parties having claims of any kind against 3616
the issuing authority, irrespective of whether those parties 3617
have notice thereof. The pledge shall create a perfected 3618
security interest for all purposes of Chapter 1309. of the 3619

Revised Code and a perfected lien for purposes of any other 3620
interest, all without the necessity for separation or delivery 3621
of funds or for the filing or recording of the applicable bond 3622
proceedings by which that pledge is created or any certificate, 3623
statement, or other document with respect thereto. The pledge of 3624
the pledged receipts shall be effective and the money therefrom 3625
and thereof may be applied to the purposes for which pledged. 3626
(G) Obligations may be further secured, as determined by 3627
the issuing authority, by an indenture or a trust agreement 3628
between the issuing authority and a corporate trustee, which may 3629
be any trust company or bank having a place of business within 3630
the state. Any indenture or trust agreement may contain the 3631
resolution or order authorizing the issuance of the obligations, 3632
any provisions that may be contained in any bond proceedings, 3633
and other provisions that are customary or appropriate in an 3634
agreement of that type, including, but not limited to: 3635
(1) Maintenance of each pledge, indenture, trust 3636
agreement, or other instrument comprising part of the bond 3637
proceedings until the issuing authority has fully paid or 3638
provided for the payment of debt service on the obligations 3639
secured by it; 3640
(2) In the event of default in any payments required to be 3641
made by the bond proceedings, enforcement of those payments or 3642

obligations and of the trustee and provisions for protecting and 3646
enforcing them, including limitations on rights of individual 3647
holders and owners. 3648

(H) The bond proceedings may contain additional provisions 3649

option of the issuing authority or of the holder or upon the 3654
occurrence of certain conditions, and at a particular price or 3655

application of special funds, and the safeguarding of moneys on 3659
hand or on deposit, in lieu of the applicability of provisions 3660
of Chapter 131. or 135. of the Revised Code, but subject to any 3661
special provisions of this section with respect to the 3662
application of particular funds or moneys. Any financial 3663
institution that acts as a depository of any moneys in special 3664
funds or other funds under the bond proceedings may furnish 3665
indemnifying bonds or pledge securities as required by the 3666
issuing authority. 3667

to time be authorized to take actions as may be necessary to 3672
perform all or any part of the duty required by the provision; 3673
(5) The maintenance of each pledge or instrument 3674

obligations, and such other provisions as the issuing authority 3698
determines, including limitations, conditions, or 3699
qualifications, relating to any of the foregoing or the 3700
activities of the issuing authority in connection therewith. 3701
The bond proceedings shall make provision for the payment 3702
of the expenses of the enforcement activity of the attorney 3703
general referred to in division (B) of this section from the 3704
amounts from the tobacco master settlement agreement assigned 3705
and sold to the issuing authority under that division or from 3706

the proceeds of obligations, or a combination thereof, which may 3707
include provision for both annual payments and a special fund 3708
providing reserve amounts for the payment of those expenses. 3709
The issuing authority shall not, and shall covenant in the 3710
bond proceedings that it shall not, be authorized to and shall 3711
not file a voluntary petition under the United States Bankruptcy 3712
Code, 11 U.S.C. 101 et seq., as amended, or voluntarily commence 3713
any similar bankruptcy proceeding under state law including, 3714
without limitation, consenting to the appointment of a receiver 3715
or trustee or making a general or specific assignment for the 3716
benefit of creditors, and neither any public officer or any 3717
organization, entity, or other person shall authorize the 3718
issuing authority to be or become a debtor under the United 3719
States Bankruptcy Code or take any of those actions under the 3720
United States Bankruptcy Code or state law. The state hereby 3721
covenants, and the issuing authority shall covenant, with the 3722
holders or owners of the obligations, that the state shall not 3723
permit the issuing authority to file a voluntary petition under 3724
the United States Bankruptcy Code or take any of those actions 3725
under the United States Bankruptcy Code or state law during the 3726
period obligations are outstanding and for any additional period 3727
for which the issuing authority covenants in the bond 3728
proceedings, which additional period may, but need not, be a 3729
period of three hundred sixty-seven days or more. 3730
(I) The obligations requiring execution by or for the 3731
issuing authority shall be signed as provided in the bond 3732
proceedings, and may bear the official seal of the issuing 3733
authority or a facsimile thereof. Any obligation may be signed 3734
by the individual who, on the date of execution, is the 3735
authorized signer even though, on the date of the obligations, 3736
that individual is not an authorized signer. In case the 3737
H. B. No. 278 Page 127

individual whose signature or facsimile signature appears on any 3738
obligation ceases to be an authorized signer before delivery of 3739
the obligation, that signature or facsimile is nevertheless 3740
valid and sufficient for all purposes as if that individual had 3741
remained the authorized signer until delivery. 3742
(J) Obligations are investment securities under Chapter 3743

Section 126:
1308. of the Revised Code. Obligations may be issued in bearer 3744
or in registered form, registrable as to principal alone or as 3745
to both principal and interest, or both, or in certificated or 3746
uncertificated form, as the issuing authority determines. 3747
Provision may be made for the exchange, conversion, or transfer 3748
of obligations and for reasonable charges for registration, 3749
exchange, conversion, and transfer. Pending preparation of final 3750
obligations, the issuing authority may provide for the issuance 3751
of interim instruments to be exchanged for the final 3752
obligations. 3753
(K) Obligations may be sold at public sale or at private 3754
sale, in such manner, and at such price at, above, or below par, 3755
all as determined by and provided by the issuing authority in 3756
the bond proceedings. 3757
(L) Except to the extent that rights are restricted by the 3758
bond proceedings, any owner of obligations or provider of or 3759
counterparty to a credit enhancement facility may by any 3760
suitable form of legal proceedings protect and enforce any 3761
rights relating to obligations or that facility under the laws 3762
of this state or granted by the bond proceedings. Those rights 3763
include the right to compel the performance of all applicable 3764
duties of the issuing authority and the state. Each duty of the 3765
issuing authority and that issuing authority's officers, staff, 3766

authority to perform that duty, specifically enjoined by law and 3771
resulting from an office, trust, or station within the meaning 3772
of section 2731.01 of the Revised Code. The individuals who are 3773
from time to time members of the issuing authority, or their 3774
designees acting pursuant to section 183.52 of the Revised Code, 3775
or the issuing authority's officers, staff, agents, or 3776
employees, when acting within the scope of their employment or 3777
agency, shall not be liable in their personal capacities on any 3778
obligations or otherwise under the bond proceedings, or for 3779
otherwise exercising or carrying out any purposes or powers of 3780
the issuing authority. 3781
(M)(1) Subject to any applicable limitations in division 3782
(C) of this section, the issuing authority may also authorize 3783
and provide for the issuance of: 3784
(a) Obligations in the form of bond anticipation notes, 3785
and may authorize and provide for the renewal of those notes 3786
from time to time by the issuance of new notes. The holders of 3787
notes or appertaining interest coupons have the right to have 3788
debt service on those notes paid solely from the moneys and 3789
special funds, and all or any portion of the pledged receipts, 3790
that are or may be pledged to that payment, including the 3791
proceeds of bonds or renewal notes or both, as the issuing 3792
authority provides in the bond proceedings authorizing the 3793
notes. Notes may be additionally secured by covenants of the 3794
issuing authority to the effect that the issuing authority will 3795
do all things necessary for the issuance of bonds or renewal 3796
notes in such principal amount and upon such terms as may be 3797
necessary to provide moneys to pay when due the debt service on 3798

proceedings authorizing the issuance of bond anticipation notes 3802
the issuing authority shall set forth for the bonds anticipated 3803
an estimated schedule of annual principal payments the latest of 3804
which shall be no later than provided in division (D) of this 3805

Section 127:
section. While the notes are outstanding there shall be 3806
deposited, as shall be provided in the bond proceedings for 3807
those notes, from the sources authorized for payment of debt 3808
service on the bonds, amounts sufficient to pay the principal of 3809
the bonds anticipated as set forth in that estimated schedule 3810
during the time the notes are outstanding, which amounts shall 3811
be used solely to pay the principal of those notes or of the 3812
bonds anticipated. 3813
(b) Obligations for the refunding, including funding and 3814
retirement, and advance refunding, with or without payment or 3815
redemption prior to maturity, of any obligations previously 3816
issued under this section and any bonds or notes previously 3817
issued for the purpose of paying costs of capital facilities 3818

notify each such company of any amount due, which amount shall 6712
be paid by each such company to the treasurer of state by the 6713
fifteenth day of June next succeeding. If a company has for any 6714
reason overpaid or was illegally or erroneously assessed or 6715
charged for collection a larger amount of tax than its annual 6716
tax as computed by the superintendent of insurance and an 6717
application for refund was timely filed under section 5729.102 6718

been made and mailed to it, or if the annual statement required 6725
by law to be made by it is false or incorrect, the 6726
superintendent of insurance may revoke the license of such 6727
company doing business in this state. Upon failure to pay the 6728
tax or to make partial payment thereof according to law, the 6729
superintendent treasurer of state shall certify that fact the 6730

any other county he the attorney general elects, to recover the 6734
amount of the tax. If such company ceases to do business in this 6735
state, it shall thereupon make a report to the superintendent of 6736

(1) In the dissolution of a partnership by death, the 6751
surviving partner may operate under the license of the 6752
partnership for a period of sixty days. 6753
(2) The heirs or legal representatives of deceased 6754
persons, and receivers and trustees in bankruptcy, appointed by 6755
any competent authority, may operate under the license of the 6756
person so succeeded in possession. 6757
(3) Two or more persons who are not partners may operate a 6758
single place of business under one license. In such case neither 6759
the retirement of any such person from business at that place of 6760
business, nor the entrance of any person, under an existing 6761
arrangement, shall affect the license or require the issuance of 6762
a new license, unless the person retiring from the business is 6763
the individual named on the vendor's license. 6764
Except as otherwise provided in this section, each 6765
applicant for a license shall make out and deliver to the county 6766
auditor of each county in which the applicant desires to engage 6767
in business, upon a blank to be furnished by such auditor for 6768

that purpose, a statement showing the name of the applicant, 6769
each place of business in the county where the applicant will 6770
make retail sales, the nature of the business, and any other 6771
information the tax commissioner reasonably prescribes in the 6772
form of a statement prescribed by the commissioner. 6773
At the time of making the application, the applicant shall 6774
pay into the county treasury a license fee in the sum of fifty 6775
dollars for each fixed place of business in the county that will 6776
be the situs of retail sales. Upon receipt of the application 6777
and exhibition of the county treasurer's receipt, showing the 6778
payment of the license fee, the county auditor shall issue to 6779
the applicant a license for each fixed place of business 6780
designated in the application, authorizing the applicant to 6781
engage in business at that location. The county auditor shall 6782
transmit remit twenty-five dollars of each license fee to the 6783
treasurer of state attorney general for deposit into the state 6784
treasury to the credit of the organized crime commission fund 6785
for the purposes specified in section 177.011 of the Revised 6786
Code. The remaining twenty-five dollars of each license fee 6787
shall be credited to the general fund of the county. 6788
(B) If a vendor's identity changes, the vendor shall apply 6789
for a new license. If a vendor wishes to move an existing fixed 6790
place of business to a new location within the same county, the 6791
vendor shall obtain a new vendor's license or submit a request 6792
to the commissioner to transfer the existing vendor's license to 6793
the new location. When the new location has been verified as 6794
being within the same county, the commissioner shall authorize 6795
the transfer and notify the county auditor of the change of 6796
location. If a vendor wishes to move an existing fixed place of 6797
business to another county, the vendor's license shall not 6798
transfer and the vendor shall obtain a new vendor's license from 6799

the license shall be prescribed by the commissioner. The fees 6801
collected shall be credited as specified in division (A)(3) of 6802
this section. If a vendor fails to notify the commissioner of a 6803
change of location of its fixed place of business or that its 6804
business has closed, the commissioner may cancel the vendor's 6805
license if ordinary mail sent to the location shown on the 6806
license is returned because of an undeliverable address. 6807
(C) The commissioner may establish or participate in a 6808
registration system whereby any vendor may obtain a vendor's 6809
license by submitting to the commissioner a vendor's license 6810
application and a license fee of fifty dollars for each fixed 6811
place of business at which the vendor intends to make retail 6812
sales. Under this registration system, the commissioner shall 6813
issue a vendor's license to the applicant on behalf of the 6814
county auditor of the county in which the applicant desires to 6815
engage in business, and shall forward a copy of the application 6816
and license fee to that county. Twenty-five dollars of each 6817
license fee received by the commissioner for the issuance of 6818
vendor's licenses shall be deposited into the vendor's license 6819
application fund, which is hereby created in the state treasury. 6820
The remaining twenty-five dollars of each license fee shall be 6821
deposited into the organized crime commission fund for the 6822
purposes specified in section 177.011 of the Revised Code. The 6823
commissioner shall certify to the director of budget and 6824
management within ten business days after the close of a month 6825
the license fees to be transmitted to each county from the 6826
vendor's license application fund for vendor's license 6827

A vendor that makes retail sales subject to tax under 6833
Chapter 5739. of the Revised Code pursuant to a permit issued by 6834
the division of liquor control shall obtain a vendor's license 6835
in the identical name and for the identical address as shown on 6836
the permit. 6837
Except as otherwise provided in this section, if a vendor 6838
has no fixed place of business and sells from a vehicle, each 6839
vehicle intended to be used within a county constitutes a place 6840
of business for the purpose of this section. 6841
(D) As used in this section, "transient vendor" means any 6842
person who makes sales of tangible personal property from 6843
vending machines located on land owned by others, who leases 6844
titled motor vehicles, titled watercraft, or titled outboard 6845
motors, who effectuates leases that are taxed according to 6846
division (A)(2) of section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, or who, 6847
in the usual course of the person's business, transports 6848
inventory, stock of goods, or similar tangible personal property 6849
to a temporary place of business or temporary exhibition, show, 6850
fair, flea market, or similar event in a county in which the 6851
person has no fixed place of business, for the purpose of making 6852
retail sales of such property. A "temporary place of business" 6853
means any public or quasi-public place including, but not 6854
limited to, a hotel, rooming house, storeroom, building, part of 6855
a building, tent, vacant lot, railroad car, or motor vehicle 6856
that is temporarily occupied for the purpose of making retail 6857
sales of goods to the public. A place of business is not 6858
temporary if the same person conducted business at the place 6859
continuously for more than six months or occupied the premises 6860
H. B. No. 278 Page 231
As Introduced
as the person's permanent residence for more than six months, or 6861
if the person intends it to be a fixed place of business. 6862
Any transient vendor, in lieu of obtaining a vendor's 6863
license under division (A) of this section for counties in which 6864
the transient vendor has no fixed place of business, may apply 6865
to the tax commissioner, on a form prescribed by the 6866
commissioner, for a transient vendor's license. The transient 6867
vendor's license authorizes the transient vendor to make retail 6868
sales in any county in which the transient vendor does not 6869
maintain a fixed place of business. Any holder of a transient 6870
vendor's license shall not be required to obtain a separate 6871
vendor's license from the county auditor in that county. Upon 6872
the commissioner's determination that an applicant is a 6873
transient vendor, the applicant shall pay a license fee in the 6874
amount of fifty dollars, at which time the tax commissioner 6875
shall issue the license. Twenty-five dollars of that license fee 6876
shall be deposited into the organized crime commission fund for 6877
the purposes specified in section 177.011 of the Revised Code. 6878
The tax commissioner may require a vendor to be licensed as a 6879
transient vendor if, in the opinion of the commissioner, such 6880
licensing is necessary for the efficient administration of the 6881
tax. 6882
Any holder of a valid transient vendor's license may make 6883
retail sales at a temporary place of business or temporary 6884
exhibition, show, fair, flea market, or similar event, held 6885
anywhere in the state without complying with any provision of 6886

Section 229:
section 311.37 of the Revised Code. Any holder of a valid 6887
vendor's license may make retail sales as a transient vendor at 6888
a temporary place of business or temporary exhibition, show, 6889
fair, flea market, or similar event held in any county in which 6890
the vendor maintains a fixed place of business for which the 6891

vendor's license. 6893
(E) Any vendor who is issued a license pursuant to this 6894

Section 230:
section shall display the license or a copy of it prominently, 6895
in plain view, at every place of business of the vendor. 6896
(F) No owner, organizer, or promoter who operates a fair, 6897
flea market, show, exhibition, convention, or similar event at 6898
which transient vendors are present shall fail to keep a 6899
comprehensive record of all such vendors, listing the vendor's 6900
name, permanent address, vendor's license number, and the type 6901
of goods sold. Such records shall be kept for four years and 6902
shall be open to inspection by the commissioner. 6903
(G) The commissioner may issue additional types of 6904
licenses if required to efficiently administer the tax imposed 6905
by this chapter. 6906
Sec. 5747.51. (A) On or before the twenty-fifth day of 6907
July of each year, the tax commissioner shall make and certify 6908
to the county auditor of each county an estimate of the amount 6909
of the local government fund to be allocated to the undivided 6910
local government fund of each county for the ensuing calendar 6911
year, adjusting the total as required to account for 6912
subdivisions receiving local government funds under section 6913

Section 231:

(B) At each annual regular session of the county budget 6915
commission convened pursuant to section 5705.27 of the Revised 6916
Code, each auditor shall present to the commission the 6917
certificate of the commissioner, the annual tax budget and 6918
estimates, and the records showing the action of the commission 6919
in its last preceding regular session. The commission, after 6920

extending to the representatives of each subdivision an 6921
opportunity to be heard, under oath administered by any member 6922
of the commission, and considering all the facts and information 6923
presented to it by the auditor, shall determine the amount of 6924
the undivided local government fund needed by and to be 6925
apportioned to each subdivision for current operating expenses, 6926
as shown in the tax budget of the subdivision. This 6927
determination shall be made pursuant to divisions (C) to (I) of 6928
this section, unless the commission has provided for a formula 6929
pursuant to section 5747.53 of the Revised Code. The 6930
commissioner shall reduce the amount of funds from the undivided 6931
local government fund to a subdivision required to receive 6932
reduced funds under section 5747.502 of the Revised Code. 6933
Nothing in this section prevents the budget commission, 6934
for the purpose of apportioning the undivided local government 6935
fund, from inquiring into the claimed needs of any subdivision 6936
as stated in its tax budget, or from adjusting claimed needs to 6937
reflect actual needs. For the purposes of this section, "current 6938
operating expenses" means the lawful expenditures of a 6939
subdivision, except those for permanent improvements and except 6940
payments for interest, sinking fund, and retirement of bonds, 6941
notes, and certificates of indebtedness of the subdivision. 6942
(C) The commission shall determine the combined total of 6943
the estimated expenditures, including transfers, from the 6944
general fund and any special funds other than special funds 6945
established for road and bridge; street construction, 6946
maintenance, and repair; state highway improvement; and gas, 6947
water, sewer, and electric public utilities operated by a 6948

(1) Expenditures for permanent improvements as defined in 6955
division (E) of section 5705.01 of the Revised Code; 6956

electric public utilities, from all other sources except those 6982
that a subdivision receives from an additional tax or service 6983
charge voted by its electorate or receives from special 6984
assessment or revenue bond collection. For the purposes of this 6985
division, where the charter of a municipal corporation prohibits 6986
the levy of an income tax, an income tax levied by the 6987
legislative authority of such municipal corporation pursuant to 6988
an amendment of the charter of that municipal corporation to 6989
authorize such a levy represents an additional tax voted by the 6990
electorate of that municipal corporation. For the purposes of 6991
this division, any measure adopted by a board of county 6992
commissioners pursuant to section 322.02, 4504.02, or 5739.021 6993
of the Revised Code, including those measures upheld by the 6994
electorate in a referendum conducted pursuant to section 6995

Section 234:
322.021, 4504.021, or 5739.022 of the Revised Code, shall not be 6996

Subject to division (F) of section 5705.29 of the Revised 6998
Code, money in a reserve balance account established by a 6999
county, township, or municipal corporation under section 5705.13 7000
of the Revised Code shall not be considered an unencumbered 7001
balance or revenue under division (E)(3) or (4) of this section. 7002
Money in a reserve balance account established by a township 7003

arising from investment of the principal or investment of such 7014
additions to principal may be considered an unencumbered balance 7015
or revenue under those divisions. 7016
(F) The total expenditures calculated pursuant to division 7017
(C) of this section, less the deductions authorized in divisions 7018
(D) and (E) of this section, shall be known as the "relative 7019
need" of the subdivision, for the purposes of this section. 7020
(G) The budget commission shall total the relative need of 7021
all participating subdivisions in the county, and shall compute 7022
a relative need factor by dividing the total estimate of the 7023
undivided local government fund by the total relative need of 7024
all participating subdivisions. 7025
(H) The relative need of each subdivision shall be 7026
multiplied by the relative need factor to determine the 7027
proportionate share of the subdivision in the undivided local 7028
government fund of the county; provided, that the maximum 7029
proportionate share of a county shall not exceed the following 7030
maximum percentages of the total estimate of the undivided local 7031
government fund governed by the relationship of the percentage 7032
of the population of the county that resides within municipal 7033
corporations within the county to the total population of the 7034
county as reported in the reports on population in Ohio by the 7035
department of development as of the twentieth day of July of the 7036

this division so that the proportionate share of the county does 7043
not exceed these limitations, and it shall increase the 7044
proportionate shares of all other subdivisions on a pro rata 7045
basis. In counties having a population of less than one hundred 7046

proportionate to the amount by which the amount of the undivided 7072
local government fund for that calendar year is less than the 7073
amount of the undivided local government fund apportioned for 7074
the calendar year 1970. 7075
(J) On the basis of such apportionment, the county auditor 7076
shall compute the percentage share of each such subdivision in 7077
the undivided local government fund and shall at the same time 7078
certify to the tax commissioner the percentage share of the 7079
county as a subdivision. No payment shall be made from the 7080
undivided local government fund, except in accordance with such 7081

repurchase agreement shall not exceed thirty days and the market 1319

institution or dealer shall provide all of the following 1330

governing board agrees to sell securities owned by the 1338
subdivision to a purchaser and agrees with that purchaser to 1339
unconditionally repurchase those securities. 1340
(F) No treasurer or governing board shall make an 1341
investment under this section, unless the treasurer or governing 1342
board, at the time of making the investment, reasonably expects 1343
that the investment can be held until its maturity. 1344
(G) No treasurer or governing board shall pay interim 1345
moneys into a fund established by another subdivision, 1346
treasurer, governing board, or investing authority, if that fund 1347

of other subdivisions. This division does not apply to the 1349

issuance of taxable notes for the purpose of arbitrage is 1362
prohibited. Contracting to sell securities that have not yet 1363
been acquired by the treasurer or governing board, for the 1364

bond prices will decline, is prohibited. 1366
(I) Whenever, during a period of designation, the 1367
treasurer classifies public moneys as interim moneys, the 1368
treasurer shall notify the governing board of such action. The 1369
notification shall be given within thirty days after such 1370
classification and in the event the governing board does not 1371
concur in such classification or in the investments or deposits 1372
made under this section, the governing board may order the 1373
treasurer to sell or liquidate any of such investments or 1374
deposits, and any such order shall specifically describe the 1375
investments or deposits and fix the date upon which they are to 1376
be sold or liquidated. Investments or deposits so ordered to be 1377
sold or liquidated shall be sold or liquidated for cash by the 1378

office. 1385

the name of the treasurer as such. 1392

treasurer under this section. Any securities may be deposited 1395
for safekeeping with a qualified trustee as provided in section 1396
135.18 of the Revised Code, except the delivery of securities 1397
acquired under any repurchase agreement under this section shall 1398
be made to a qualified trustee, provided, however, that the 1399
qualified trustee shall be required to report to the treasurer, 1400
governing board, auditor of state, or an authorized outside 1401
auditor at any time upon request as to the identity, market 1402
value, and location of the document evidencing each security, 1403
and that if the participating institution is a designated 1404
depository of the subdivision for the current period of 1405
designation, the securities that are the subject of the 1406
repurchase agreement may be delivered to the treasurer or held 1407

agreement shall contain the requirement that for each 2280
transaction pursuant to the agreement the participating 2281
institution shall provide all of the following information: 2282

these collection activities, any characterization of the issuing 3407
authority or its obligations for purposes of accounting, 3408
taxation, or securities regulation, or by any other factors 3409
whatsoever. A true sale shall exist under this section 3410
regardless of whether the issuing authority has any recourse 3411
against the state or any other term of the bond proceedings or 3412
the treatment or characterization of the transfer as a financing 3413
for any purpose. Upon and following the assignment and sale, the 3414
state shall not have any right, title, or interest in the 3415
portion of the receipts under the tobacco master settlement 3416
agreement so assigned and sold, other than any residual interest 3417
that may be described in the applicable bond proceedings for 3418
those obligations, and that portion, if any, shall be the 3419
property of the issuing authority and not of the state, and 3420
shall be paid directly to the issuing authority, and shall be 3421
owned, received, held, and disbursed by the issuing authority 3422
and not by the state. 3423
The state may covenant, pledge, and agree in the bond 3424
proceedings, with and for the benefit of the issuing authority, 3425
the holders and owners of obligations, and providers of any 3426
credit enhancement facilities, that it shall: (1) maintain 3427
statutory authority for, and cause to be collected and paid 3428
directly to the issuing authority or its assignee, the pledged 3429
receipts, (2) enforce the rights of the issuing authority to 3430
receive the receipts under the tobacco master settlement 3431
agreement assigned and sold to the issuing authority, (3) not 3432
materially impair the rights of the issuing authority to fulfill 3433
the terms of its agreements with the holders or owners of 3434

materially impair the rights and remedies of the holders or 3436
owners of outstanding obligations or materially impair the 3437
security for those outstanding obligations, and (5) enforce 3438
Chapter 1346. of the Revised Code, the tobacco master settlement 3439
agreement, and the consent decree to effectuate the collection 3440
of the pledged tobacco settlement receipts. The bond proceedings 3441
may provide or authorize the manner for determining material 3442
impairment of the security for any outstanding obligations, 3443
including by assessing and evaluating the pledged receipts in 3444
the aggregate. 3445
As further provided for in division (H) of this section, 3446
the bond proceedings may also include such other covenants, 3447
pledges, and agreements by the state to protect and safeguard 3448
the security and rights of the holders and owners of the 3449
obligations, and of the providers of any credit enhancement 3450
facilities, including, without limiting the generality of the 3451
foregoing, any covenant, pledge, or agreement customary in 3452
transactions involving the issuance of securities the debt 3453
service on which is payable from or secured by amounts received 3454
under the tobacco master settlement agreement. Notwithstanding 3455
any other provision of law, any covenant, pledge, and agreement 3456
of the state, if and when made in the bond proceedings, shall be 3457
controlling and binding upon, and enforceable against the state 3458
in accordance with its terms for so long as any obligations are 3459
outstanding under the applicable bond proceedings. The bond 3460
proceedings may also include limitations on the remedies 3461
available to the issuing authority, the holders and owners of 3462
the obligations, and the providers of any credit enhancement 3463
facilities, including, without limiting the generality of the 3464
foregoing, a provision that those remedies may be limited to 3465

tobacco master settlement agreement, or the consent decree as 3469
may have been covenanted or agreed in the bond proceedings under 3470
division (B)(5) of this section. 3471

cigarettes or other tobacco products, or from defending or 3476
prosecuting cases or other actions relating to the sale or use 3477
of cigarettes or other tobacco products. Except as otherwise may 3478
be agreed in writing by the attorney general, nothing in this 3479
section or the bond proceedings shall modify or limit, or be 3480
construed to modify or limit, the responsibility, power, 3481
judgment, and discretion of the attorney general to protect and 3482
discharge the duties, rights, and obligations of the state under 3483
the tobacco master settlement agreement, the consent decree, or 3484
Chapter 1346. of the Revised Code. 3485

consultation with the attorney general, on behalf of the state, 3487

by that issuing authority, on behalf of the issuing authority, 3489
may take any action and execute any documents, including any 3490
purchase and sale agreements, necessary to effect the assignment 3491
and sale and the acceptance of the assignment and title to the 3492
receipts including, providing irrevocable direction to the 3493

other bond proceedings may contain the terms and conditions 3498
established by the state and the issuing authority to carry out 3499
and effectuate the purposes of this section, including, without 3500
limitation, covenants binding the state in favor of the issuing 3501
authority and its assignees and the owners of the obligations. 3502

effectuate such purchase and sale without regard to any other 3504
laws governing other property sales or financial transactions by 3505
the state. 3506

principal amount of obligations issued under this section shall 3517
not exceed six billion dollars, exclusive of obligations issued 3518
under division (M)(1) of this section to refund, renew, or 3519
advance refund other obligations issued or incurred. At least 3520

obligations issued under the authority of this section, 3522
exclusive of obligations issued to refund, renew, or advance 3523
refund other obligations, shall be paid to the state for deposit 3524

(D) Each issue of obligations shall be authorized by 3527
resolution or order of the issuing authority. The bond 3528
proceedings shall provide for or authorize the manner for 3529
determining the principal amount or maximum principal amount of 3530
obligations of an issue, the principal maturity or maturities, 3531
the interest rate or rates, the date of and the dates of payment 3532
of interest on the obligations, their denominations, and the 3533
place or places of payment of debt service which may be within 3534

the thirty-first day of December of the fiftieth calendar year 3537
after the year of issuance of the particular obligations or of 3538
the fiftieth calendar year after the year in which the original 3539
obligation to pay was issued or entered into. Sections 9.96, 3540
9.98, 9.981, 9.982, and 9.983 of the Revised Code apply to the 3541
obligations. 3542
The purpose of the obligations may be stated in the bond 3543
proceedings in general terms, such as, as applicable, "paying 3544
costs of capital facilities for a system of common schools" and 3545
"paying costs of facilities for state-supported and state- 3546
assisted institutions of higher education." Unless otherwise 3547
provided in the bond proceedings or in division (C) of this 3548
section, the net proceeds from the issuance of the obligations 3549
shall be paid to the state for deposit into the applicable 3550
improvement fund. In addition to the investments authorized in 3551
Chapter 135. of the Revised Code, the net proceeds held in an 3552
improvement fund may be invested by the treasurer of state in 3553
guaranteed investment contracts with providers rated at the time 3554

nationally recognized rating agencies, all subject to the terms 3556

proceedings. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Chapter 3558
3318. of the Revised Code, net proceeds of obligations deposited 3559
into the school building program assistance fund created in 3560
section 3318.25 of the Revised Code may be used to pay basic 3561
project costs under that chapter at the times determined by the 3562
Ohio facilities construction commission without regard to 3563
whether those expenditures are in proportion to the state's and 3564
the school district's respective shares of that basic project 3565
cost; provided that this shall not result in any change in the 3566
state or school district shares of the basic project costs as 3567
determined under that chapter. As used in the preceding 3568
sentence, "Ohio facilities construction commission" and "basic 3569
project costs" have the same meanings as in section 3318.01 of 3570
the Revised Code. 3571

Code. The attorney general as counsel to the issuing authority 3583
shall represent the authority in the execution of its powers and 3584
duties, and shall institute and prosecute all actions on its 3585
behalf. The issuing authority, in consultation with the attorney 3586

appoint the counsel selected, for the purposes of carrying out 3588

charges on obligations issued under this section, and for the 3598
establishment and maintenance of any reserves, as provided in 3599
the bond proceedings, and make other provisions in the bond 3600
proceedings with respect to pledged receipts as authorized by 3601
this section, which provisions are controlling notwithstanding 3602
any other provisions of law pertaining to them. Any and all 3603
pledged receipts received by the issuing authority and required 3604
by the bond proceedings, consistent with this section, to be 3605
deposited, transferred, or credited to the bond service fund, 3606
and all other money transferred or allocated to or received for 3607
the purposes of that fund, shall be deposited and credited to 3608
the bond service fund created in the bond proceedings for the 3609
obligations, subject to any applicable provisions of those bond 3610
proceedings, but without necessity for any act of appropriation. 3611
Those pledged receipts shall immediately be subject to the lien 3612
of that pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further 3613
act, and shall not be subject to other court judgments. The lien 3614
of the pledge of those pledged receipts shall be valid and 3615
binding against all parties having claims of any kind against 3616
the issuing authority, irrespective of whether those parties 3617
have notice thereof. The pledge shall create a perfected 3618
security interest for all purposes of Chapter 1309. of the 3619

H. B. No. 278 Page 123
As Introduced
Revised Code and a perfected lien for purposes of any other 3620
interest, all without the necessity for separation or delivery 3621
of funds or for the filing or recording of the applicable bond 3622
proceedings by which that pledge is created or any certificate, 3623
statement, or other document with respect thereto. The pledge of 3624
the pledged receipts shall be effective and the money therefrom 3625
and thereof may be applied to the purposes for which pledged. 3626
(G) Obligations may be further secured, as determined by 3627
the issuing authority, by an indenture or a trust agreement 3628
between the issuing authority and a corporate trustee, which may 3629
be any trust company or bank having a place of business within 3630
the state. Any indenture or trust agreement may contain the 3631
resolution or order authorizing the issuance of the obligations, 3632
any provisions that may be contained in any bond proceedings, 3633
and other provisions that are customary or appropriate in an 3634

secured by it; 3640

special provisions of this section with respect to the 3662
application of particular funds or moneys. Any financial 3663

funds or other funds under the bond proceedings may furnish 3665
indemnifying bonds or pledge securities as required by the 3666
issuing authority. 3667

state. Any trust agreement may contain the resolution 4383
authorizing the issuance of the obligations, any provisions that 4384
may be contained in the bond proceedings, and other provisions 4385
that are customary or appropriate in an agreement of the type. 4386

this state or granted by the bond proceedings. Such rights 4391
include the right to compel the performance of all duties of the 4392

the business done in this state during the calendar year in 6693
which the payment date provided by this paragraph is contained. 6694
Payments shall be made electronically as prescribed by the 6695

insurance company shall pay to the treasurer of state the tax 6700
assessable under section 3737.71 of the Revised Code and this 6701
chapter, calculated by such company from such annual statement. 6702

state, after deducting the tax already paid, shall promptly 6711
notify each such company of any amount due, which amount shall 6712
be paid by each such company to the treasurer of state by the 6713

by law to be made by it is false or incorrect, the 6726
superintendent of insurance may revoke the license of such 6727
company doing business in this state. Upon failure to pay the 6728
tax or to make partial payment thereof according to law, the 6729
superintendent treasurer of state shall certify that fact the 6730
tax liability and any related interest and penalties to the 6731
attorney general, who shall thereupon begin an action against 6732
the company in the court of common pleas of Franklin county, or 6733

(2) The heirs or legal representatives of deceased 6754
persons, and receivers and trustees in bankruptcy, appointed by 6755
any competent authority, may operate under the license of the 6756
person so succeeded in possession. 6757
(3) Two or more persons who are not partners may operate a 6758
single place of business under one license. In such case neither 6759
the retirement of any such person from business at that place of 6760
business, nor the entrance of any person, under an existing 6761
arrangement, shall affect the license or require the issuance of 6762
a new license, unless the person retiring from the business is 6763
the individual named on the vendor's license. 6764
Except as otherwise provided in this section, each 6765
applicant for a license shall make out and deliver to the county 6766
auditor of each county in which the applicant desires to engage 6767
in business, upon a blank to be furnished by such auditor for 6768

At the time of making the application, the applicant shall 6774
pay into the county treasury a license fee in the sum of fifty 6775
dollars for each fixed place of business in the county that will 6776
be the situs of retail sales. Upon receipt of the application 6777
and exhibition of the county treasurer's receipt, showing the 6778
payment of the license fee, the county auditor shall issue to 6779
the applicant a license for each fixed place of business 6780
designated in the application, authorizing the applicant to 6781
engage in business at that location. The county auditor shall 6782
transmit remit twenty-five dollars of each license fee to the 6783
treasurer of state attorney general for deposit into the state 6784
treasury to the credit of the organized crime commission fund 6785
for the purposes specified in section 177.011 of the Revised 6786
Code. The remaining twenty-five dollars of each license fee 6787
shall be credited to the general fund of the county. 6788
(B) If a vendor's identity changes, the vendor shall apply 6789
for a new license. If a vendor wishes to move an existing fixed 6790
place of business to a new location within the same county, the 6791
vendor shall obtain a new vendor's license or submit a request 6792
to the commissioner to transfer the existing vendor's license to 6793
the new location. When the new location has been verified as 6794
being within the same county, the commissioner shall authorize 6795
the transfer and notify the county auditor of the change of 6796
location. If a vendor wishes to move an existing fixed place of 6797
business to another county, the vendor's license shall not 6798

this section. If a vendor fails to notify the commissioner of a 6803
change of location of its fixed place of business or that its 6804
business has closed, the commissioner may cancel the vendor's 6805
license if ordinary mail sent to the location shown on the 6806
license is returned because of an undeliverable address. 6807
(C) The commissioner may establish or participate in a 6808
registration system whereby any vendor may obtain a vendor's 6809
license by submitting to the commissioner a vendor's license 6810
application and a license fee of fifty dollars for each fixed 6811
place of business at which the vendor intends to make retail 6812
sales. Under this registration system, the commissioner shall 6813
issue a vendor's license to the applicant on behalf of the 6814
county auditor of the county in which the applicant desires to 6815
engage in business, and shall forward a copy of the application 6816
and license fee to that county. Twenty-five dollars of each 6817
license fee received by the commissioner for the issuance of 6818
vendor's licenses shall be deposited into the vendor's license 6819
application fund, which is hereby created in the state treasury. 6820
The remaining twenty-five dollars of each license fee shall be 6821
deposited into the organized crime commission fund for the 6822
purposes specified in section 177.011 of the Revised Code. The 6823
commissioner shall certify to the director of budget and 6824
management within ten business days after the close of a month 6825
the license fees to be transmitted to each county from the 6826
vendor's license application fund for vendor's license 6827

A vendor that makes retail sales subject to tax under 6833
Chapter 5739. of the Revised Code pursuant to a permit issued by 6834
the division of liquor control shall obtain a vendor's license 6835
in the identical name and for the identical address as shown on 6836
the permit. 6837
Except as otherwise provided in this section, if a vendor 6838
has no fixed place of business and sells from a vehicle, each 6839
vehicle intended to be used within a county constitutes a place 6840
of business for the purpose of this section. 6841
(D) As used in this section, "transient vendor" means any 6842
person who makes sales of tangible personal property from 6843
vending machines located on land owned by others, who leases 6844
titled motor vehicles, titled watercraft, or titled outboard 6845
motors, who effectuates leases that are taxed according to 6846
division (A)(2) of section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, or who, 6847
in the usual course of the person's business, transports 6848
inventory, stock of goods, or similar tangible personal property 6849
to a temporary place of business or temporary exhibition, show, 6850
fair, flea market, or similar event in a county in which the 6851
person has no fixed place of business, for the purpose of making 6852
retail sales of such property. A "temporary place of business" 6853
means any public or quasi-public place including, but not 6854
limited to, a hotel, rooming house, storeroom, building, part of 6855
a building, tent, vacant lot, railroad car, or motor vehicle 6856
that is temporarily occupied for the purpose of making retail 6857
sales of goods to the public. A place of business is not 6858
temporary if the same person conducted business at the place 6859
continuously for more than six months or occupied the premises 6860

H. B. No. 278 Page 231
As Introduced
as the person's permanent residence for more than six months, or 6861
if the person intends it to be a fixed place of business. 6862
Any transient vendor, in lieu of obtaining a vendor's 6863
license under division (A) of this section for counties in which 6864
the transient vendor has no fixed place of business, may apply 6865
to the tax commissioner, on a form prescribed by the 6866
commissioner, for a transient vendor's license. The transient 6867
vendor's license authorizes the transient vendor to make retail 6868
sales in any county in which the transient vendor does not 6869
maintain a fixed place of business. Any holder of a transient 6870
vendor's license shall not be required to obtain a separate 6871
vendor's license from the county auditor in that county. Upon 6872
the commissioner's determination that an applicant is a 6873
transient vendor, the applicant shall pay a license fee in the 6874
amount of fifty dollars, at which time the tax commissioner 6875
shall issue the license. Twenty-five dollars of that license fee 6876
shall be deposited into the organized crime commission fund for 6877
the purposes specified in section 177.011 of the Revised Code. 6878
The tax commissioner may require a vendor to be licensed as a 6879
transient vendor if, in the opinion of the commissioner, such 6880
licensing is necessary for the efficient administration of the 6881
tax. 6882
Any holder of a valid transient vendor's license may make 6883
retail sales at a temporary place of business or temporary 6884
exhibition, show, fair, flea market, or similar event, held 6885
anywhere in the state without complying with any provision of 6886
section 311.37 of the Revised Code. Any holder of a valid 6887
vendor's license may make retail sales as a transient vendor at 6888
a temporary place of business or temporary exhibition, show, 6889
fair, flea market, or similar event held in any county in which 6890
the vendor maintains a fixed place of business for which the 6891

vendor holds a vendor's license without obtaining a transient 6892
vendor's license. 6893
(E) Any vendor who is issued a license pursuant to this 6894
section shall display the license or a copy of it prominently, 6895
in plain view, at every place of business of the vendor. 6896
(F) No owner, organizer, or promoter who operates a fair, 6897
flea market, show, exhibition, convention, or similar event at 6898
which transient vendors are present shall fail to keep a 6899
comprehensive record of all such vendors, listing the vendor's 6900
name, permanent address, vendor's license number, and the type 6901
of goods sold. Such records shall be kept for four years and 6902
shall be open to inspection by the commissioner. 6903
(G) The commissioner may issue additional types of 6904
licenses if required to efficiently administer the tax imposed 6905
by this chapter. 6906
Sec. 5747.51. (A) On or before the twenty-fifth day of 6907
July of each year, the tax commissioner shall make and certify 6908
to the county auditor of each county an estimate of the amount 6909
of the local government fund to be allocated to the undivided 6910
local government fund of each county for the ensuing calendar 6911
year, adjusting the total as required to account for 6912
subdivisions receiving local government funds under section 6913
5747.502 of the Revised Code. 6914
(B) At each annual regular session of the county budget 6915
commission convened pursuant to section 5705.27 of the Revised 6916
Code, each auditor shall present to the commission the 6917
certificate of the commissioner, the annual tax budget and 6918
estimates, and the records showing the action of the commission 6919
in its last preceding regular session. The commission, after 6920

extending to the representatives of each subdivision an 6921
opportunity to be heard, under oath administered by any member 6922
of the commission, and considering all the facts and information 6923
presented to it by the auditor, shall determine the amount of 6924
the undivided local government fund needed by and to be 6925
apportioned to each subdivision for current operating expenses, 6926
as shown in the tax budget of the subdivision. This 6927
determination shall be made pursuant to divisions (C) to (I) of 6928
this section, unless the commission has provided for a formula 6929
pursuant to section 5747.53 of the Revised Code. The 6930
commissioner shall reduce the amount of funds from the undivided 6931
local government fund to a subdivision required to receive 6932
reduced funds under section 5747.502 of the Revised Code. 6933
Nothing in this section prevents the budget commission, 6934
for the purpose of apportioning the undivided local government 6935
fund, from inquiring into the claimed needs of any subdivision 6936
as stated in its tax budget, or from adjusting claimed needs to 6937
reflect actual needs. For the purposes of this section, "current 6938
operating expenses" means the lawful expenditures of a 6939
subdivision, except those for permanent improvements and except 6940
payments for interest, sinking fund, and retirement of bonds, 6941
notes, and certificates of indebtedness of the subdivision. 6942
(C) The commission shall determine the combined total of 6943
the estimated expenditures, including transfers, from the 6944
general fund and any special funds other than special funds 6945
established for road and bridge; street construction, 6946
maintenance, and repair; state highway improvement; and gas, 6947
water, sewer, and electric public utilities operated by a 6948
subdivision, as shown in the subdivision's tax budget for the 6949
ensuing calendar year. 6950

the tax budget: 6954
(1) Expenditures for permanent improvements as defined in 6955
division (E) of section 5705.01 of the Revised Code; 6956
(2) In the case of counties and townships, transfers to 6957
the road and bridge fund, and in the case of municipalities, 6958
transfers to the street construction, maintenance, and repair 6959
fund and the state highway improvement fund; 6960
(3) Expenditures for the payment of debt charges; 6961
(4) Expenditures for the payment of judgments. 6962
(E) In addition to the deductions made pursuant to 6963
division (D) of this section, revenues accruing to the general 6964
fund and any special fund considered under division (C) of this 6965
section from the following sources shall be deducted from the 6966
combined total of expenditures calculated pursuant to division 6967
(C) of this section: 6968
(1) Taxes levied within the ten-mill limitation, as 6969
defined in section 5705.02 of the Revised Code; 6970

for road and bridge; street construction, maintenance, and 6980
repair; state highway improvement; and gas, water, sewer, and 6981
electric public utilities, from all other sources except those 6982
that a subdivision receives from an additional tax or service 6983
charge voted by its electorate or receives from special 6984
assessment or revenue bond collection. For the purposes of this 6985
division, where the charter of a municipal corporation prohibits 6986
the levy of an income tax, an income tax levied by the 6987
legislative authority of such municipal corporation pursuant to 6988
an amendment of the charter of that municipal corporation to 6989
authorize such a levy represents an additional tax voted by the 6990
electorate of that municipal corporation. For the purposes of 6991
this division, any measure adopted by a board of county 6992
commissioners pursuant to section 322.02, 4504.02, or 5739.021 6993
of the Revised Code, including those measures upheld by the 6994
electorate in a referendum conducted pursuant to section 6995
322.021, 4504.021, or 5739.022 of the Revised Code, shall not be 6996
considered an additional tax voted by the electorate. 6997
Subject to division (F) of section 5705.29 of the Revised 6998
Code, money in a reserve balance account established by a 6999
county, township, or municipal corporation under section 5705.13 7000
of the Revised Code shall not be considered an unencumbered 7001
balance or revenue under division (E)(3) or (4) of this section. 7002
Money in a reserve balance account established by a township 7003
under section 5705.132 of the Revised Code shall not be 7004
considered an unencumbered balance or revenue under division (E) 7005
(3) or (4) of this section. 7006
If a county, township, or municipal corporation has 7007
created and maintains a nonexpendable trust fund under section 7008

division (E)(3) or (4) of this section. Only investment earnings 7013
arising from investment of the principal or investment of such 7014
additions to principal may be considered an unencumbered balance 7015
or revenue under those divisions. 7016
(F) The total expenditures calculated pursuant to division 7017
(C) of this section, less the deductions authorized in divisions 7018
(D) and (E) of this section, shall be known as the "relative 7019
need" of the subdivision, for the purposes of this section. 7020
(G) The budget commission shall total the relative need of 7021
all participating subdivisions in the county, and shall compute 7022
a relative need factor by dividing the total estimate of the 7023
undivided local government fund by the total relative need of 7024
all participating subdivisions. 7025
(H) The relative need of each subdivision shall be 7026
multiplied by the relative need factor to determine the 7027
proportionate share of the subdivision in the undivided local 7028
government fund of the county; provided, that the maximum 7029
proportionate share of a county shall not exceed the following 7030
maximum percentages of the total estimate of the undivided local 7031
government fund governed by the relationship of the percentage 7032
of the population of the county that resides within municipal 7033
corporations within the county to the total population of the 7034
county as reported in the reports on population in Ohio by the 7035
department of development as of the twentieth day of July of the 7036

subdivision for the calendar years 1968, 1969, and 1970, 7054
multiplied by the total amount of the undivided local government 7055
fund of the county apportioned pursuant to former section 7056
5739.23 of the Revised Code for the calendar year 1970. For the 7057
purposes of this division, the total apportioned amount for the 7058

county in 1970 from the state collected intangible tax as levied 7060
by section 5707.03 of the Revised Code and distributed pursuant 7061
to section 5725.24 of the Revised Code, plus the amount received 7062
by the county in the calendar year 1970 pursuant to division (B) 7063
(1) of former section 5739.21 of the Revised Code, and 7064
distributed pursuant to former section 5739.22 of the Revised 7065

for any calendar year is less than the amount of the undivided 7067
local government fund apportioned pursuant to former section 7068
5739.23 of the Revised Code for the calendar year 1970, the 7069
minimum amount guaranteed to each subdivision for that calendar 7070
year pursuant to this division shall be reduced on a basis 7071
proportionate to the amount by which the amount of the undivided 7072
local government fund for that calendar year is less than the 7073
amount of the undivided local government fund apportioned for 7074
the calendar year 1970. 7075
(J) On the basis of such apportionment, the county auditor 7076
shall compute the percentage share of each such subdivision in 7077
the undivided local government fund and shall at the same time 7078
certify to the tax commissioner the percentage share of the 7079
county as a subdivision. No payment shall be made from the 7080
undivided local government fund, except in accordance with such 7081
percentage shares. 7082
Within ten days after the budget commission has made its 7083
apportionment, whether conducted pursuant to section 5747.51 or 7084
5747.53 of the Revised Code, the auditor shall publish a list of 7085
the subdivisions and the amount each is to receive from the 7086
undivided local government fund and the percentage share of each 7087
subdivision, in a newspaper or newspapers of countywide 7088
circulation, and send a copy of such allocation to the tax 7089
commissioner. 7090

As Introduced
The county auditor shall also send a copy of such 7091
allocation by ordinary or electronic mail to the fiscal officer 7092
of each subdivision entitled to participate in the allocation of 7093

shall constitute the official notice of the commission action 7095
referred to in section 5705.37 of the Revised Code. 7096
All money received into the treasury of a subdivision from 7097
the undivided local government fund in a county treasury shall 7098
be paid into the general fund and used for the current operating 7099
expenses of the subdivision. 7100
If a municipal corporation maintains a municipal 7101
university, such municipal university, when the board of 7102
trustees so requests the legislative authority of the municipal 7103
corporation, shall participate in the money apportioned to such 7104
municipal corporation from the total local government fund, 7105
however created and constituted, in such amount as requested by 7106
the board of trustees, provided such sum does not exceed nine 7107
per cent of the total amount paid to the municipal corporation. 7108
If any public official fails to maintain the records 7109
required by sections 5747.50 to 5747.55 of the Revised Code or 7110
by the rules issued by the tax commissioner, the auditor of 7111
state, or the treasurer of state pursuant to such sections, or 7112
fails to comply with any law relating to the enforcement of such 7113
sections, the local government fund money allocated to the 7114
county may be withheld until such time as the public official 7115
has complied with such sections or such law or the rules issued 7116
pursuant thereto. 7117

section 6101.50 of the Revised Code, and that, when ordered by 7128
the board to do so, the treasurer shall return to the board, 7129
duly canceled, any bonds and notes not sold, which bonds and 7130
notes shall remain in the custody of the board, which shall 7131
produce them for inspection or for use as evidence whenever and 7132
wherever legally requested to do so. The cost of the bond of the 7133
treasurer shall be paid by the board from the funds of the 7134
district. The board shall make appropriations at the proper time 7135
for the payment of the maturing bonds and notes of the district 7136
and the interest payments coming due on all bonds and notes 7137
sold, and the treasurer of the district shall place sufficient 7138
funds at the place of payment to pay them. If proper 7139
appropriations are not made by the board as provided in this 7140
section, the treasurer of the district of the treasurer's own 7141
accord shall place funds at the place of payment and report that 7142
action to the next meeting of the board. The canceled bonds and 7143
coupons, receipted notes, and receipts of the treasurer shall be 7144
evidence of such payment. 7145
The successor in office of any treasurer of a conservancy 7146
district is not entitled to take over the assets of the treasury 7147
until the treasurer has complied with this section. Moneys 7148
derived from the sale of bonds and from all other sources shall 7149

cost of the properties, works, and improvements and costs, 7153
expenses, fees, and salaries authorized by law. 7154
The district may secure the payment of loans from the 7155
United States government in the same manner as it may secure the 7156
payment of bonds, and the board may make any necessary 7157
regulations to provide for that payment. 7158
A party who has not sought a remedy against any proceeding 7159
under this chapter, until bonds or notes have been sold or the 7160
work constructed, cannot for any cause have an injunction 7161
against the collection of assessments for the payment of the 7162
bonds or notes. 7163
When consideration for bonds is received by the district, 7164
the bonds shall not be invalid for any irregularity or defect in 7165
the proceedings for their issuance and sale, and shall be 7166
incontestable in the hands of bona fide purchasers or holders of 7167
the bonds for value. No proceedings in respect to the issuance 7168
of any bonds are necessary except as required by this chapter. 7169
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section 7170
governing the deposit or investment of moneys of a conservancy 7171
district, the board of directors of a district, for the purpose 7172
of providing for the investment of the moneys on the district's 7173
behalf, may order the treasurer of the district to invest moneys 7174
of the district in the Ohio subdivision's fund authorized to be 7175
