(a) For a person other than an individual, income 22
apportioned or sitused to the municipal corporation under 23
section 718.02 of the Revised Code, as applicable, reduced by 24
any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward available to the 25
person for the municipal corporation. 26

who are not residents of the qualified municipal corporation and 40
net profit of persons that are not wholly located within the 41
qualified municipal corporation, such individual or person shall 42
have no municipal taxable income for the purposes of the tax 43
levied by the qualified municipal corporation and may be 44

long-term care" has the same meaning given in section 7702B(c) 939
of the Internal Revenue Code. Solely for purposes of division 940
(A)(10)(a) of this section, "dependent" includes a person who 941
otherwise would be a "qualifying relative" and thus a 942

States department of the treasury regulations. The deduction 952
otherwise allowed under division (A)(11)(a) of this section 953

gross income for any taxable year to the extent that the amount 958
is attributable to the recovery during the taxable year of any 959
amount deducted or excluded in computing federal or Ohio 960
adjusted gross income in any taxable year. 961
(12) Deduct any portion of the deduction described in 962
section 1341(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, for repaying 963
previously reported income received under a claim of right, that 964
meets both of the following requirements: 965
(a) It is allowable for repayment of an item that was 966
included in the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for a prior 967
taxable year and did not qualify for a credit under division (A) 968
or (B) of section 5747.05 of the Revised Code for that year; 969
(b) It does not otherwise reduce the taxpayer's adjusted 970
gross income for the current or any other taxable year. 971
(13) Deduct an amount equal to the deposits made to, and 972
net investment earnings of, a medical savings account during the 973
taxable year, in accordance with section 3924.66 of the Revised 974

does not apply to medical savings account deposits and earnings 976
otherwise deducted or excluded for the current or any other 977
taxable year from the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income. 978
(14)(a) Add an amount equal to the funds withdrawn from a 979
medical savings account during the taxable year, and the net 980
investment earnings on those funds, when the funds withdrawn 981
were used for any purpose other than to reimburse an account 982
holder for, or to pay, eligible medical expenses, in accordance 983

(b) Add the amounts distributed from a medical savings 985
account under division (A)(2) of section 3924.68 of the Revised 986
Code during the taxable year. 987
(15) Add any amount claimed as a credit under section 988
5747.059 of the Revised Code to the extent that such amount 989
satisfies either of the following: 990
(a) The amount was deducted or excluded from the 991
computation of the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income as 992
required to be reported for the taxpayer's taxable year under 993
the Internal Revenue Code; 994
(b) The amount resulted in a reduction of the taxpayer's 995
federal adjusted gross income as required to be reported for any 996
of the taxpayer's taxable years under the Internal Revenue Code. 997
(16) Deduct the amount contributed by the taxpayer to an 998
individual development account program established by a county 999
department of job and family services pursuant to sections 1000
329.11 to 329.14 of the Revised Code for the purpose of matching 1001
funds deposited by program participants. On request of the tax 1002
