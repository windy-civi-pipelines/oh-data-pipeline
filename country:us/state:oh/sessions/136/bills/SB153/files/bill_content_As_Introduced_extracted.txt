to have insufficient valid signatures, or both, the petitioners' 447
committee may protest such findings or solicit additional 448
signatures as provided in section 307.95 of the Revised Code, or 449

scanned by automatic tabulating equipment before the close of 3791
the polls on the day of the election, but the board of elections 3792

the board of elections, or observers shall not disclose the 3795
count or any portion of the count of absent voter's ballots 3796
prior to the time of the closing of the polling places. No 3797

3509.05, 3509.08, or 3511.09 of the Revised Code shall be 3803
processed and counted in each precinct, at the office of the 3804

of each precinct on election day identification envelopes 3815
purporting to contain absent voter's ballots of electors whose 3816
voting residence appears from the statement of voter on the 3817
outside of each of those envelopes, to be located in that 3818
manager's precinct, and which were received by the board not 3819
later than the close of the polls on election day. The board 3820
shall deliver to the voting location manager a list containing 3821
the name and voting residence of each person whose voting 3822
residence is in such precinct to whom absent voter's ballots 3823
were mailed. 3824
(2) The board shall not deliver to the voting location 3825
manager identification envelopes cast by electors who provided a 3826
program participant identification number instead of a residence 3827
address on the identification envelope and shall not inform the 3828
voting location manager of the names and voting residences of 3829
persons who have confidential voter registration records. Those 3830

office of the board of elections or at another location 3835
designated by the board, special election officials shall be 3836
appointed by the board for that purpose having the same 3837
authority as is exercised by precinct election officials. The 3838
votes so cast shall be added to the vote totals by the board, 3839
and the absent voter's ballots shall be preserved separately by 3840
the board, in the same manner and for the same length of time as 3841
provided by section 3505.31 of the Revised Code. 3842
(D) Each of the identification envelopes purporting to 3843
contain absent voter's ballots delivered to the voting location 3844
manager of the precinct or the special election official 3845
appointed by the board of elections shall be handled as follows: 3846
(1) The election officials shall compare the signature of 3847
the elector on the outside of the identification envelope with 3848
the signature of that elector on the elector's registration form 3849
and verify that the absent voter's ballot is eligible to be 3850
counted under section 3509.07 of the Revised Code. 3851
(2)(a) Any of the precinct officials may challenge the 3852
right of the elector named on the identification envelope to 3853
vote the absent voter's ballots upon the ground that the 3854
signature on the envelope is not the same as the signature on 3855
the registration form, that the identification envelope 3856
statement of voter is incomplete, or upon any other of the 3857
grounds upon which the right of persons to vote may be lawfully 3858
challenged. 3859
(b) If the elector's name does not appear in the pollbook 3860

information contained in the statewide voter registration 3896
database concerning the voter, the election officials shall mail 3897
a written notice to the voter, informing the voter of the nature 3898
of the defect. The notice shall inform the voter that in order 3899
for the voter's ballot to be counted, the voter must provide the 3900
necessary information to the board of elections in writing and 3901
on a form prescribed by the secretary of state not later than 3902
the fourth day after the day of the election. The voter may 3903

mail. If the voter provides the necessary information to the 3905
board of elections not later than the fourth day after the day 3906
of the election and the ballot is not successfully challenged on 3907
another basis, the voter's ballot shall be processed and counted 3908

sustained, the identification envelope of such elector shall not 3932
be opened, shall be endorsed "Not Counted" with the reasons the 3933
ballots were not counted, and shall be delivered to the board. 3934

3509.051 of the Revised Code, other than an elector who has a 4189
confidential voter registration record, as described in section 4190
111.44 of the Revised Code. 4191
(B) If a registered elector appears to vote and that 4192
elector has requested or cast an absent voter's ballot for that 4193
election, the elector shall be permitted to cast a provisional 4194

board of elections determines that the absent voter's ballot in 4203
the sealed identification envelope is valid, it shall be 4204
counted. If the board of elections determines that the signature 4205
on the sealed identification envelope purporting to contain the 4206
elector's voted absent voter's ballot does not match the 4207
signature on the elector's registration form, the ballot shall 4208
be set aside and the board shall examine, during the time prior 4209
to the beginning of the official canvass, the poll list or 4210

provisional ballot under section 3505.181 of the Revised Code. 4213

ballot, instead of the absent voter's ballot, if both of the 4215
following apply: 4216
(a) The board of elections determines that the signature 4217
of the elector on the outside of the identification envelope in 4218
which the absent voter's ballots are enclosed does not match the 4219
signature of the elector on the elector's registration form; 4220
(b) The elector cast a provisional ballot in the election. 4221
(3) If the board of elections does not receive the sealed 4222
identification envelope purporting to contain the elector's 4223
voted absent voter's ballot by the applicable deadline 4224
established under section 3509.05 of the Revised Code, the 4225
provisional ballot cast under section 3505.181 of the Revised 4226
Code shall be counted as valid, if that provisional ballot is 4227
otherwise determined to be valid pursuant to section 3505.183 of 4228
the Revised Code. 4229
(D) If the board of elections counts a provisional ballot 4230
under division (C)(2) or (3) of this section, the returned 4231
identification envelope of that elector shall not be opened, and 4232
the ballot within that envelope shall not be counted. The 4233
identification envelope shall be endorsed "Not Counted" with the 4234
reason the ballot was not counted. 4235
(E) Division (C) of this section does not apply to absent 4236
voter's ballots cast in person under section 3509.051 of the 4237
Revised Code. If an elector casts absent voter's ballots in 4238
person and casts a provisional ballot for the same election, the 4239
provisional ballot shall not be counted. 4240
