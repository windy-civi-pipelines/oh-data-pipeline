Recognizing May 2025 as ALS Awareness Month.
General Assembly of Ohio are pleased to recognize May 2025 as 2
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Awareness Month in Ohio; and 3
WHEREAS, A progressive neurodegenerative disease, ALS, which is 4
also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease, negatively affects the nerve cells 5
in the brain and spinal cord that control the nerves and muscles in 6
the body, and within five years of being diagnosed, the person will 7
often lose the ability to speak, walk, swallow, and breathe and will 8
then die. People diagnosed with ALS eventually need continuous care, 9
twenty-four hours a day, every day, and they are dependent on their 10
families and caregivers completely. Educating the populace about the 11
existence and outcomes of this condition and the efforts done to 12
combat it are at the heart of ALS Awareness Month; and 13
WHEREAS, There is much we do not know about ALS, and it is through 14
initiatives such as ALS Awareness Month and the National ALS Registry 15
that we can encourage individuals to help create a world where the 16
disease is better understood and hopefully a cure is found. We have 17
faith that by recognizing this month, we can assist those afflicted 18
with this debilitating illness; and 19
WHEREAS, As medical advances continue and what was previously 20
considered impossible becomes commonplace, undertakings such as this 21
are a fine reminder of the collective power of people unified behind a 22
cause. Educating the community during the month of May about the fight 23
against ALS is undoubtedly a worthy endeavor, and it will help us 24
forge a brighter future; therefore be it 25
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the House of Representatives of 26
