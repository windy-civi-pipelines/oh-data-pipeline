ability to walk, the registrar or deputy registrar shall enter 202

on which the person will have that disability, as indicated on 204

removable windshield placard will expire on the indicated date, 210
and that the person is required to renew the placard by 211
submitting to the registrar or a deputy registrar another 212
prescription, and by complying with the renewal provisions. If 213

The office of vital statistics shall make available to the 234
bureau all information necessary to enable the bureau to comply 235
with division (C)(10) of this section. 236

be fined not less than two hundred fifty nor more than five 564

reported by the person so arrested or convicted in response to 570
any inquiries contained in any application for employment, 571
license, or other right or privilege, or made in connection with 572
the person's appearance as a witness. 573

submits an application for registration of a motor vehicle under 91

tax levied under Chapter 4504. of the Revised Code, and the 108

the ability to walk or a pregnant woman may apply to the 112

signing an application provided by the registrar. 114

prescription from the person's health care provider prescribing 116
such a placard for the person based upon a determination that 117
the person meets at least one of the criteria contained in 118
division (A)(1) of this section or is pregnant. The health care 119
provider shall state on the prescription the length of time the 120
health care provider expects the applicant to have the 121
disability that limits or impairs the person's ability to walk 122
or the due date of the unborn child, as applicable. If the 123
length of time the applicant is expected to have the disability 124
is six consecutive months or less, the applicant shall submit an 125
application for a temporary removable windshield placard. If the 126
applicant is pregnant and does not otherwise have a separate 127
disability that limits or impairs the applicant's ability to 128
walk, the applicant shall submit an application for a pregnancy 129
removable windshield placard. If the length of time the 130
applicant is expected to have the disability is permanent, the 131
applicant shall submit an application for a permanent removable 132
windshield placard. All other applicants shall submit an 133
application for a standard removable windshield placard. 134
(3) In addition to one placard or one or more sets of 135

additional placard, but only if the person applies separately 138
for the additional placard, states the reasons why the 139
additional placard is needed, and the registrar, in the 140
registrar's discretion determines that good and justifiable 141
cause exists to approve the request for the additional placard. 142
(4) An organization may apply to the registrar of motor 143
vehicles for a standard removable windshield placard by 144
completing and signing an application provided by the registrar. 145
The organization shall comply with any procedures the registrar 146
establishes by rule. The organization shall include with the 147
application documentary evidence that the registrar requires by 148
rule showing that the organization regularly transports persons 149
with disabilities that limit or impair the ability to walk. 150
(5) The registrar or deputy registrar shall issue to an 151
applicant a standard removable windshield placard, a temporary 152
removable windshield placard, a pregnancy removable windshield 153
placard, or a permanent removable windshield placard, as 154
applicable, upon receipt of all of the following: 155
(a) A completed and signed application for a removable 156
windshield placard; 157
(b) The accompanying documents required under division (C) 158
(2) or (4) of this section; 159

As Introduced
date of expiration on both sides of the placard, or the word 167
"permanent" if the placard is a permanent removable windshield 168
placard, and shall be valid until expired, revoked, or 169
surrendered. Except for a permanent removable windshield 170
placard, which has no expiration, or a pregnancy removable 171
windshield placard, which expires after one year, a removable 172
windshield placard expires on the earliest of the following two 173
dates: 174
(a) The date that the person issued the placard is 175
expected to no longer have the disability that limits or impairs 176
the ability to walk, as indicated on the prescription submitted 177
with the application for the placard; 178
(b) Ten years after the date of issuance on the placard. 179
In no case shall a removable windshield placard be valid 180
for a period of less than sixty days. 181
(7) Standard removable windshield placards shall be 182
renewable upon application and upon payment of a service fee 183
equal to the amount established under section 4503.038 of the 184
Revised Code. The registrar shall provide the application form 185
and shall determine the information to be included thereon. 186
(8) The registrar shall determine the form and size of 187
each type of the removable windshield placard, the material of 188
which it is to be made, any differences in color between each 189
type of placard to make them readily identifiable, and any other 190
information to be included thereon, and shall adopt rules 191
relating to the issuance, expiration, revocation, surrender, and 192
proper display of such placards. A temporary removable 193
windshield placard shall display the word "temporary" in letters 194
of such size as the registrar shall prescribe. Any placard 195

H. B. No. 450 Page 8
As Introduced
issued after October 14, 1999, shall be manufactured in a manner 196
that allows the expiration date of the placard to be indicated 197
on it through the punching, drilling, boring, or creation by any 198
other means of holes in the placard. 199
(9)(9)(a) At the time a removable windshield placard is 200
issued to a person with a disability that limits or impairs the 201
ability to walk, the registrar or deputy registrar shall enter 202
into the records of the bureau of motor vehicles the last date 203
on which the person will have that disability, as indicated on 204
the accompanying prescription. For a standard removable 205
windshield placard, not less than thirty days prior to that date 206
and any renewal dates, the bureau shall send a renewal notice to 207
that person at the person's last known address as shown in the 208
records of the bureau, informing the person that the person's 209
removable windshield placard will expire on the indicated date, 210
and that the person is required to renew the placard by 211
submitting to the registrar or a deputy registrar another 212
prescription, and by complying with the renewal provisions. If 213
such a prescription is not received by the registrar or a deputy 214
registrar by that date, the placard issued to that person 215
expires and no longer is valid, and this fact shall be recorded 216
in the records of the bureau. 217
(b) At the time a pregnancy removable windshield placard 218
is issued to a pregnant woman, the registrar or deputy registrar 219

imprisonment. 540
An arrest or conviction for a violation of division (F)(1) 541
(a)(i) or (ii) of this section does not constitute a criminal 542
record and need not be reported by the person so arrested or 543
convicted in response to any inquiries contained in any 544
application for employment, license, or other right or 545
privilege, or made in connection with the person's appearance as 546

be fined not less than two hundred fifty nor more than five 564
hundred dollars. 565
In no case shall an offender who violates division (F)(2) 566
of this section be sentenced to any term of imprisonment. An 567
arrest or conviction for a violation of division (F)(2) of this 568
section does not constitute a criminal record and need not be 569
reported by the person so arrested or convicted in response to 570
any inquiries contained in any application for employment, 571
license, or other right or privilege, or made in connection with 572
the person's appearance as a witness. 573
(4) Whoever violates division (H) of this section shall be 574
punished as follows: 575
(a) Except as otherwise provided in division (J)(4) of 576
this section, the offender shall be issued a warning. 577

Section 2. That existing sections 4503.44 and 4511.69 of 602

presented in this act as a composite of the section as amended 605
by both H.B. 33 and H.B. 195 of the 135th General Assembly. The 606
