wear a real-time processing, continual tracking electronic 1584
monitoring device during the period of time specified by the 1585
court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal the 1586
duration of an additional prison term that the court could have 1587
imposed upon the offender under division (H)(2)(a) of this 1588
section. A sanction imposed under this division shall commence 1589
on the date specified by the court, provided that the sanction 1590
shall not commence until after the offender has served the 1591
prison term imposed for the felony violation of section 2907.22, 1592

2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25 of the Revised Code and any 1593
residential sanction imposed for the violation under section 1594
2929.16 of the Revised Code. A sanction imposed under this 1595
division shall be considered to be a community control sanction 1596
for purposes of section 2929.15 of the Revised Code, and all 1597
provisions of the Revised Code that pertain to community control 1598
sanctions shall apply to a sanction imposed under this division, 1599
except to the extent that they would by their nature be clearly 1600
inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs associated with a 1601
sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of the 1602
use of the monitoring device. 1603
(I) At the time of sentencing, the court may recommend the 1604
offender for placement in a program of shock incarceration under 1605
section 5120.031 of the Revised Code or for placement in an 1606
intensive program prison under section 5120.032 of the Revised 1607
Code, disapprove placement of the offender in a program of shock 1608
incarceration or an intensive program prison of that nature, or 1609
make no recommendation on placement of the offender. In no case 1610
shall the department of rehabilitation and correction place the 1611
offender in a program or prison of that nature unless the 1612
department determines as specified in section 5120.031 or 1613
5120.032 of the Revised Code, whichever is applicable, that the 1614
offender is eligible for the placement. 1615
If the court disapproves placement of the offender in a 1616
program or prison of that nature, the department of 1617
rehabilitation and correction shall not place the offender in 1618
any program of shock incarceration or intensive program prison. 1619
If the court recommends placement of the offender in a 1620
program of shock incarceration or in an intensive program 1621
prison, and if the offender is subsequently placed in the 1622

H. B. No. 457 Page 56
As Introduced
recommended program or prison, the department shall notify the 1623
court of the placement and shall include with the notice a brief 1624
description of the placement. 1625
If the court recommends placement of the offender in a 1626
program of shock incarceration or in an intensive program prison 1627
and the department does not subsequently place the offender in 1628
the recommended program or prison, the department shall send a 1629
notice to the court indicating why the offender was not placed 1630
in the recommended program or prison. 1631
If the court does not make a recommendation under this 1632
division with respect to an offender and if the department 1633
determines as specified in section 5120.031 or 5120.032 of the 1634
Revised Code, whichever is applicable, that the offender is 1635
eligible for placement in a program or prison of that nature, 1636
the department shall screen the offender and determine if there 1637
is an available program of shock incarceration or an intensive 1638
program prison for which the offender is suited. If there is an 1639
available program of shock incarceration or an intensive program 1640
prison for which the offender is suited, the department shall 1641
notify the court of the proposed placement of the offender as 1642
specified in section 5120.031 or 5120.032 of the Revised Code 1643
and shall include with the notice a brief description of the 1644
placement. The court shall have ten days from receipt of the 1645
notice to disapprove the placement. 1646
(J) If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to 1647
aggravated vehicular homicide in violation of division (A)(1) of 1648
section 2903.06 of the Revised Code and division (B)(2)(c) or 1649
(d) of that section applies, the person shall be sentenced 1650
pursuant to section 2929.142 of the Revised Code. 1651
(K)(1) The court shall impose an additional mandatory 1652

H. B. No. 457 Page 57
As Introduced
prison term of two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 1653
ten, or eleven years on an offender who is convicted of or 1654
pleads guilty to a violent felony offense if the offender also 1655
is convicted of or pleads guilty to a specification of the type 1656
described in section 2941.1424 of the Revised Code that charges 1657
that the offender is a violent career criminal and had a firearm 1658
on or about the offender's person or under the offender's 1659
control while committing the presently charged violent felony 1660
offense and displayed or brandished the firearm, indicated that 1661
the offender possessed a firearm, or used the firearm to 1662
facilitate the offense. The offender shall serve the prison term 1663
imposed under this division consecutively to and prior to the 1664
prison term imposed for the underlying offense. The prison term 1665
shall not be reduced pursuant to section 2929.20, division (A) 1666
(2) or (3) of section 2967.193 or 2967.194, or any other 1667
provision of Chapter 2967. or 5120. of the Revised Code. A court 1668
may not impose more than one sentence under division (B)(2)(a) 1669
of this section and this division for acts committed as part of 1670
the same act or transaction. 1671
(2) As used in division (K)(1) of this section, "violent 1672
career criminal" and "violent felony offense" have the same 1673
meanings as in section 2923.132 of the Revised Code. 1674
(L) If an offender receives or received a sentence of life 1675
imprisonment without parole, a sentence of life imprisonment, a 1676
definite sentence, or a sentence to an indefinite prison term 1677
under this chapter for a felony offense that was committed when 1678
the offender was under eighteen years of age, the offender's 1679
parole eligibility shall be determined under section 2967.132 of 1680
the Revised Code. 1681
Sec. 2929.22. (A) Unless a mandatory jail term is required 1682

to be imposed by division (G) of section 1547.99, division (B) 1683
of section 4510.14, division (G) of section 4511.19 of the 1684
Revised Code, or any other provision of the Revised Code a court 1685
that imposes a sentence under this chapter upon an offender for 1686
a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has discretion to determine 1687
the most effective way to achieve the purposes and principles of 1688
sentencing set forth in section 2929.21 of the Revised Code. 1689
Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is 1690
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an 1691
offense or the penalty for an offense or by any provision of 1692
sections 2929.23 to 2929.28 of the Revised Code, a court that 1693
imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose 1694
on the offender any sanction or combination of sanctions under 1695
sections 2929.24 to 2929.28 of the Revised Code. The court shall 1696
not impose a sentence that imposes an unnecessary burden on 1697
local government resources. 1698
(B)(1) In determining the appropriate sentence for a 1699
misdemeanor, the court shall consider all of the following 1700
factors: 1701
(a) The nature and circumstances of the offense or 1702
offenses; 1703
(b) Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and 1704
the offense or offenses indicate that the offender has a history 1705
of persistent criminal activity and that the offender's 1706
character and condition reveal a substantial risk that the 1707
offender will commit another offense; 1708
(c) Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and 1709
the offense or offenses indicate that the offender's history, 1710
character, and condition reveal a substantial risk that the 1711

H. B. No. 457 Page 59
As Introduced
offender will be a danger to others and that the offender's 1712
conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive, 1713
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to 1714
the consequences; 1715
(d) Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other 1716
factor made the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or 1717
made the impact of the offense more serious; 1718
(e) Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes 1719
in general, in addition to the circumstances described in 1720
divisions (B)(1)(b) and (c) of this section; 1721
(f) Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or 1722
physical condition that is traceable to the offender's service 1723
in the armed forces of the United States and that was a 1724
contributing factor in the offender's commission of the offense 1725
or offenses; 1726
(g) Whether the circumstances of the offense indicate that 1727
the offender was motivated to commit the offense by the race, 1728
religion, elected or appointed position, political affiliation, 1729
political association, or biological sex of the victim; 1730
(h) The offender's military service record. 1731
(2) In determining the appropriate sentence for a 1732
misdemeanor, if the offender enters an Alford plea, the 1733
sentencing court shall not consider whether the offender showed 1734
genuine remorse for the offense. 1735
(3) In determining the appropriate sentence for a 1736
misdemeanor, in addition to complying with division (B)(1) of 1737
this section, the court may consider any other factors that are 1738
relevant to achieving the purposes and principles of sentencing 1739
set forth in section 2929.21 of the Revised Code. 1740

H. B. No. 457 Page 60
As Introduced
(C) Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a 1741
misdemeanor, a court shall consider the appropriateness of 1742
imposing a community control sanction or a combination of 1743
community control sanctions under sections 2929.25, 2929.26, 1744
2929.27, and 2929.28 of the Revised Code. A court may impose the 1745
longest jail term authorized under section 2929.24 of the 1746
Revised Code only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of 1747
the offense or upon offenders whose conduct and response to 1748
prior sanctions for prior offenses demonstrate that the 1749
imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter the 1750
offender from committing a future criminal offense. 1751
(D)(1) A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral 1752
and written statement made by the victim, the victim's 1753
representative, the victim's attorney, if applicable, the 1754
defendant, the defense attorney, and the prosecuting authority 1755
regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division does not 1756
create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized 1757
by Chapter 2930. of the Revised Code. 1758
(2) At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon 1759
as possible after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim 1760
of the offense of the victim's right to file an application for 1761
an award of reparations pursuant to sections 2743.51 to 2743.72 1762
of the Revised Code. 1763
Sec. 2941.1428. (A) Imposition of a mandatory prison term 1764
upon an offender pursuant to division (B)(12) of section 2929.14 1765
of the Revised Code, pursuant to a determination by a court that 1766
an offense is a felony offense of violence and was politically 1767
motivated, is precluded unless the indictment, count in the 1768
indictment, or information charging the offender specifies that 1769
the offense is a felony offense of violence and was politically 1770

H. B. No. 457 Page 61

motivated. The specification shall be stated at the end of the 1771
body of the indictment, count, or information, and shall be 1772
stated in substantially the following form: 1773
"SPECIFICATION (or, SPECIFICATION TO THE FIRST COUNT). The 1774
Grand Jurors (or insert the person's or prosecuting attorney's 1775
name when appropriate) further find and specify that (set forth 1776
that the offense is a felony offense of violence and was 1777
politically motivated)." 1778
(B) The court shall determine the issue of whether an 1779
offense was politically motivated. 1780
(C) As used in this section, a felony offense of violence 1781
is politically motivated if a motivation for the offense is the 1782
victim's political affiliation, association, belief, or 1783
ideology, whether or not the offender was mistaken as to that 1784
motivation. 1785
Section 2. That existing sections 2903.01, 2929.01, 1786
2929.12, 2929.14, and 2929.22 of the Revised Code are hereby 1787
repealed. 1788
Section 3. The General Assembly, applying the principle 1789
stated in division (B) of section 1.52 of the Revised Code that 1790
amendments are to be harmonized if reasonably capable of 1791
simultaneous operation, finds that the following sections, 1792
presented in this act as composites of the sections as amended 1793
by the acts indicated, are the resulting versions of the 1794
