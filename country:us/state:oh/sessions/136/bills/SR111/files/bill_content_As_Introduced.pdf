Honoring the Italian American Cultural Club on its
Centennial.
WHEREAS, The members of the Senate of the 136th General Assembly 1
of Ohio are pleased to congratulate the Italian American Cultural Club 2
on the auspicious occasion of its One Hundredth Anniversary, 3
celebrated May 18, 2025; and 4
WHEREAS, Recognition of this prestigious milestone is a fitting 5
tribute to the Italian American Cultural Club, for since its inception 6
a century ago, it has attained a remarkable record of service to the 7
Steubenville area. Founded in 1925 as the Steubenville Dramatic Club, 8
the organization staged various Italian performances such as plays, 9
dramas, movies, and operas to connect Italian immigrants to their 10
cultural roots while helping them become proud Americans, and it 11
gradually transitioned into its current iteration as a social club 12
that helps citizens of Italian descent celebrate their heritage. The 13
clubâ€™s accomplishments are a justifiable source of pride and an 14
outstanding reflection not only on the group itself but also on its 15
dedicated members, both past and present, and on the community; and 16
WHEREAS, Over the past century, the Italian American Cultural Club 17
has enhanced the quality of life within Steubenville and the 18
surrounding area, and through its generous contributions, it has 19
earned the respect and gratitude of generations of people. We are 20
certain that as this noteworthy organization maintains its unfaltering 21
commitment to service, it will continue in the tradition of excellence 22
that has long been its hallmark; and 23
WHEREAS, We are proud to note that it is through the unceasing 24
efforts of entities such as the Italian American Cultural Club that 25
Ohio has gained a reputation as a state that is responsive to the 26

needs of its citizens and has remained a pleasant place in which to 27
live and work. This fine group is truly deserving of high praise; 28
therefore be it 29
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the Senate of the 136th General 30
Assembly of Ohio, in adopting this Resolution, commend the Italian 31
American Cultural Club on its One Hundredth Anniversary and extend 32
best wishes for ongoing success; and be it further 33
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit a duly 34
authenticated copy of this Resolution to the Italian American Cultural 35
Club. 36
