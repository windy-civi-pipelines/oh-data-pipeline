(2) This section does not apply in the case of the owner 545
of the types of real property identified in divisions (C)(1) to 546
(4) of section 3781.25 of the Revised Code, unless the owner 547
employs a designer to make written plans for work that will 548
involve excavation. If the owner employs a designer, the 549
designer shall contact a protection service and utilities that 550
are limited basis participants in accordance with divisions (A) 551
and (B) of this section, and shall include in or with the plans 552
the information required under division (E) of this section. The 553
owner shall provide that information to the excavator. 554
(G) A public authority, as defined in section 153.64 of 555
the Revised Code, may withhold approval to a project until the 556
requirements of this section have been satisfied by the 557
developer and utility, as applicable. A public authority may 558
rely solely upon the notice submitted under division (E) of this 559
section when determining whether the requirements of this 560
section have been satisfied for purposes of granting final 561
approval of such development. A public authority is immune from 562
liability related to the approval or construction of such 563
development when the approval is based upon information as 564
provided in this division. 565
Sec. 3781.271. Beginning on July 1, 2013, each protection 566
service shall reasonably modify its one-call notification system 567
so as to permit the reasonable identification of the location of 568
a proposed excavation site in a manner in which the protection 569
service may then notify any potentially affected limited basis 570
participants. Each member of a protection service, including 571
limited basis participants, shall be responsible for providing 572
current contact information to the protection service. 573
Sec. 3781.28. (A) Except as otherwise provided in 574

divisions (C), (D), (E), and (F) of this section, at least 575
forty-eight hours but not more than ten working days before 576
commencing excavation, at least two working days, not including 577
the day of the notification, but not more than sixteen calendar 578
days before commencing excavation, the excavator shall notify a 579
the protection service of the location of the excavation site 580
and the date on which excavation is planned to commence. 581
(B) On receipt of notice under division (A) of this 582
section, the protection service shall provide to each utility 583
with underground utility facilities located at the excavation 584
site, notice of the proposed excavation. 585
(C) In the case of an interstate hazardous liquids 586
pipeline or interstate gas pipeline, the excavator shall comply 587
with the special notice requirements of the public safety 588
program of the owner of the pipeline as indicated in the plans 589
or otherwise provided to the excavator in accordance with 590
division (E) or (F)(2) of section 3781.27 of the Revised Code. 591
(D) If it has been determined pursuant to division (D) of 592
section 3781.27 of the Revised Code that relocation, support, 593
removal, or protective steps are necessary, the excavator shall 594
provide earlier notice to the utility in order to provide the 595
utility with reasonable time to coordinate making the 596
adjustments with actual excavation. 597
(E) If an excavation will cover a large area and will 598
progress from one area to the next over a period of time, the 599
excavator shall provide written notice of excavation with 600
projected timelines for segments of the excavation as the 601
excavation progresses in order to coordinate the marking of 602
underground utility facilities with actual excavation schedules. 603
Under such circumstances, the utility and excavator shall 604

Sub. H. B. No. 227 Page 22
As Passed by the House
determine a mutually agreed upon marking schedule based on the 605
project schedule. Once such a schedule is established, the 606
marking and notification requirements set forth in division (A) 607
(1) of section 3781.29 of the Revised Code shall not apply. 608
(F)(1) In the case of a utility that is making an 609
emergency repair to its own underground utility system or a 610
governmental entity making an underground emergency repair to 611
traffic control devices, as defined in section 4511.01 of the 612
Revised Code, used on any street or highway under the entity's 613
jurisdiction, the utility or governmental entity shall notify a 614
protection service and each limited basis participant of the 615
excavation site. This notice need not occur before commencing 616
excavation. 617
(2) In the case of an excavation at the site of real 618
property of the type described in divisions (C)(1) to (4) of 619
section 3781.25 of the Revised Code: 620
(a) If the owner of the property is the excavator, this 621
section does not apply unless the excavation is planned for an 622
area where a utility easement is located, a public right-of-way, 623
or where utility facilities are known to serve the property. 624
(b) If the owner of the property employs an excavator, the 625
excavator shall comply with the requirements of this section. If 626
the owner did not employ a designer to make written plans, the 627
excavator shall provide the notice required under this section 628
to a protection service and to each utility that is a limited 629
basis participant in a protection service that has underground 630
utility facilities within the municipal corporation or township 631
and county of the excavation site, as indicated by the 632
protection service. 633

Sec. 3781.29. (A)(1) Except as otherwise provided in 634
division (A)(2) of this section, within forty-eight hours at 635
least two working days, not including the day of the 636
notification, of receiving notice under section 3781.28 of the 637
Revised Code, each utility shall review the status of its 638
facilities within the excavation site, locate and mark its 639
underground utility facilities at the excavation site in such a 640
manner as to indicate their course, and report the appropriate 641
information to the protection service for its positive response 642
system. If a utility does not mark its underground utility 643
facilities or contact the excavator within that time, the 644
utility is deemed to have given notice that it does not have any 645
facilities at the excavation site. If the utility cannot 646
accurately mark the facilities, the utility shall mark them to 647
the best of its ability, notify the excavator using the positive 648
response system that the markings may not be accurate, and 649
provide additional guidance to the excavator in locating the 650
facilities as needed during the excavation. 651
(2) In the case of an interstate hazardous liquids 652
pipeline or an interstate gas pipeline, the owner of the 653
pipeline shall locate and mark its pipeline within the time 654
frame established in the public safety program of the owner. 655
(B) Unless a facility actually is uncovered or probed by 656
the utility or excavator, any indications of the depth of the 657
facility shall be treated as estimates only. (C)(1) Except as 658
provided in division (C)(2) of this section, a utility shall 659
mark its underground facilities using the following color codes: 660

approximate location. Proposed construction or excavation 670
markings shall be made in white through the use of an industry- 671
recognized method such as chalk-based paint, flags, stakes, or 672
other method applicable to the specific site and when possible 673
shall indicate the excavator's identity by name, abbreviation, 674
or initial. 675
(E)(1) Before beginning an emergency excavation, or as 676
soon as possible thereafter, an excavator shall make every 677
effort to notify a protection service of the excavation. In 678
providing notification, the excavator shall provide, at a 679
minimum: 680
(a) The name of the individual notifying the protection 681
service; 682
(b) The name, address, any electronic mail address, and 683
telephone numbers of the excavator; 684
(c) The specific location of the excavation site; 685
(d) A description of the excavation. 686
(2) Upon receiving the information set forth in division 687
(E)(1) of this section, the protection service shall provide the 688
excavator with a reference number and a list of utilities that 689
the protection service intends to notify. The protection service 690
shall immediately notify each utility that according to the 691
registration information provided under section 3781.26 of the 692
Revised Code has facilities located within the designated area 693
of the emergency excavation. 694
(3) Any utility notified of an emergency excavation may 695
inspect all of its underground utility facilities located at the 696
emergency excavation site and may take any otherwise lawful 697

approximate location of an excavation as provided in division 701
(D) of this section in any of the following situations: 702
(1) The utility can determine the precise location, 703
direction, size, and length of the proposed excavation site by 704
referring to the notification provided by the protection service 705
pursuant to sections 3781.27 and 3781.28 of the Revised Code. 706
(2) The excavator and the affected utility have had an on- 707
site, preconstruction meeting for the purpose of premarking the 708
excavation site. 709
(3) The excavation involves replacing a pole that is 710
within five feet of the location of an existing pole. 711
(4) Premarking by the excavator would clearly interfere 712
with pedestrian or vehicular traffic control. 713
Section 2. That existing sections 153.64, 3781.25, 714
3781.26, 3781.27, 3781.271, 3781.28, and 3781.29 of the Revised 715
Code are hereby repealed. 716
