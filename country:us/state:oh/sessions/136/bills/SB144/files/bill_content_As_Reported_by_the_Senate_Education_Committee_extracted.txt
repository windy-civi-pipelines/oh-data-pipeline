professional development committees to be operated by such 224
school district. The committee structure so established by a 225
district board shall remain in effect unless within thirty days 226
prior to an anniversary of the date upon which the current 227
committee structure was established, the board provides notice 228
to all affected district employees that the committee structure 229
is to be modified. Professional development committees may have 230
a district-level or building-level scope of operations, and may 231
be established with regard to particular grade or age levels for 232
which an educator license is designated. 233
Each professional development committee shall consist of 234
at least three classroom teachers employed by the district, one 235

elected by majority vote of the classroom teachers of the 243
district, and the principal member shall be elected by a 244
majority vote of the principals of the district, unless there 245
are two or fewer principals employed by the district, in which 246
case the one or two principals employed shall serve on the 247
committee. If a committee has a particular grade or age level 248
scope, the teacher members shall be licensed to teach such grade 249
or age levels, and shall be elected by majority vote of the 250
classroom teachers holding such a license and the principal 251
shall be elected by all principals serving in buildings where 252
any such teachers serve. The district superintendent shall 253
appoint a replacement to fill any vacancy that occurs on a 254
Sub. S. B. No. 144 Page 10
As Reported by the Senate Education Committee
professional development committee, except in the case of 255
vacancies among the elected classroom teacher members, which 256
shall be filled by vote of the remaining members of the 257
committee so selected. 258
Terms of office on professional development committees 259
shall be prescribed by the district board establishing the 260
committees. The conduct of elections for members of professional 261
development committees shall be prescribed by the district board 262
establishing the committees. A professional development 263
committee may include additional members, except that the 264
majority of members on each such committee shall be classroom 265
teachers employed by the district. Any member appointed to fill 266
a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration date of the term for 267
which a predecessor was appointed shall hold office as a member 268
for the remainder of that term. 269
The initial meeting of any professional development 270
committee, upon election and appointment of all committee 271
members, shall be called by a member designated by the district 272
superintendent. At this initial meeting, the committee shall 273
select a chairperson and such other officers the committee deems 274
necessary, and shall adopt rules for the conduct of its 275
meetings. Thereafter, the committee shall meet at the call of 276
the chairperson or upon the filing of a petition with the 277
district superintendent signed by a majority of the committee 278
members calling for the committee to meet. 279
(3) In the case of a school district in which an exclusive 280
representative has been established pursuant to Chapter 4117. of 281
the Revised Code, professional development committees shall be 282
established in accordance with any collective bargaining 283
agreement in effect in the district that includes provisions for 284
Sub. S. B. No. 144 Page 11
As Reported by the Senate Education Committee
such committees. 285
If the collective bargaining agreement does not specify a 286
different method for the selection of teacher members of the 287
committees, the exclusive representative of the district's 288
teachers shall select the teacher members. 289
If the collective bargaining agreement does not specify a 290
different structure for the committees, the board of education 291
of the school district shall establish the structure, including 292
the number of committees and the number of teacher and 293
administrative members on each committee; the specific 294
administrative members to be part of each committee; whether the 295
scope of the committees will be district levels, building 296
levels, or by type of grade or age levels for which educator 297
licenses are designated; the lengths of terms for members; the 298
manner of filling vacancies on the committees; and the frequency 299
and time and place of meetings. However, in all cases, except as 300
provided in division (F)(4) of this section, there shall be a 301
majority of teacher members of any professional development 302
committee, there shall be at least five total members of any 303
professional development committee, and the exclusive 304
representative shall designate replacement members in the case 305
of vacancies among teacher members, unless the collective 306
bargaining agreement specifies a different method of selecting 307
such replacements. 308
(4) Whenever an administrator's coursework plan is being 309
discussed or voted upon, the local professional development 310
committee shall, at the request of one of its administrative 311
members, cause a majority of the committee to consist of 312
administrative members by reducing the number of teacher members 313
voting on the plan. 314

to such officer. The committees established under this division 206
shall determine whether coursework that a district or chartered 207
nonpublic school teacher proposes to complete meets the 208
requirement of the rules. The state board shall provide 209
technical assistance and support to committees as the committees 210
incorporate the professional development standards adopted 211

review of coursework that is appropriate for license renewal. 213
The rules shall establish a procedure by which a teacher may 214
appeal the decision of a local professional development 215
committee. 216
(2) In any school district in which there is no exclusive 217
representative established under Chapter 4117. of the Revised 218
Code, the professional development committees shall be 219
established as described in division (F)(2) of this section. 220

Sub. S. B. No. 144 Page 9
As Reported by the Senate Education Committee
professional development committees to be operated by such 224
school district. The committee structure so established by a 225
district board shall remain in effect unless within thirty days 226
prior to an anniversary of the date upon which the current 227
committee structure was established, the board provides notice 228
to all affected district employees that the committee structure 229
is to be modified. Professional development committees may have 230
a district-level or building-level scope of operations, and may 231
be established with regard to particular grade or age levels for 232
which an educator license is designated. 233
Each professional development committee shall consist of 234
at least three classroom teachers employed by the district, one 235
principal employed by the district, and one other employee of 236
the district appointed by the district superintendent. For 237
committees with a building-level scope, the teacher and 238
principal members shall be assigned to that building, and the 239
teacher members shall be elected by majority vote of the 240
classroom teachers assigned to that building. For committees 241
with a district-level scope, the teacher members shall be 242
elected by majority vote of the classroom teachers of the 243
district, and the principal member shall be elected by a 244
majority vote of the principals of the district, unless there 245
are two or fewer principals employed by the district, in which 246
case the one or two principals employed shall serve on the 247
committee. If a committee has a particular grade or age level 248
scope, the teacher members shall be licensed to teach such grade 249
or age levels, and shall be elected by majority vote of the 250
classroom teachers holding such a license and the principal 251
shall be elected by all principals serving in buildings where 252
any such teachers serve. The district superintendent shall 253
appoint a replacement to fill any vacancy that occurs on a 254

Sub. S. B. No. 144 Page 10
As Reported by the Senate Education Committee
professional development committee, except in the case of 255
vacancies among the elected classroom teacher members, which 256
shall be filled by vote of the remaining members of the 257
committee so selected. 258
Terms of office on professional development committees 259
shall be prescribed by the district board establishing the 260
committees. The conduct of elections for members of professional 261
development committees shall be prescribed by the district board 262
establishing the committees. A professional development 263
committee may include additional members, except that the 264
majority of members on each such committee shall be classroom 265
teachers employed by the district. Any member appointed to fill 266
a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration date of the term for 267
which a predecessor was appointed shall hold office as a member 268
for the remainder of that term. 269
The initial meeting of any professional development 270
committee, upon election and appointment of all committee 271
members, shall be called by a member designated by the district 272
superintendent. At this initial meeting, the committee shall 273
select a chairperson and such other officers the committee deems 274
necessary, and shall adopt rules for the conduct of its 275
meetings. Thereafter, the committee shall meet at the call of 276
the chairperson or upon the filing of a petition with the 277
district superintendent signed by a majority of the committee 278
members calling for the committee to meet. 279
(3) In the case of a school district in which an exclusive 280
representative has been established pursuant to Chapter 4117. of 281
the Revised Code, professional development committees shall be 282
established in accordance with any collective bargaining 283
agreement in effect in the district that includes provisions for 284

Sub. S. B. No. 144 Page 11
As Reported by the Senate Education Committee
such committees. 285
If the collective bargaining agreement does not specify a 286
different method for the selection of teacher members of the 287
committees, the exclusive representative of the district's 288
teachers shall select the teacher members. 289
If the collective bargaining agreement does not specify a 290
different structure for the committees, the board of education 291
of the school district shall establish the structure, including 292
the number of committees and the number of teacher and 293
administrative members on each committee; the specific 294
administrative members to be part of each committee; whether the 295
scope of the committees will be district levels, building 296
levels, or by type of grade or age levels for which educator 297
licenses are designated; the lengths of terms for members; the 298
manner of filling vacancies on the committees; and the frequency 299
and time and place of meetings. However, in all cases, except as 300
provided in division (F)(4) of this section, there shall be a 301
majority of teacher members of any professional development 302
committee, there shall be at least five total members of any 303
professional development committee, and the exclusive 304
representative shall designate replacement members in the case 305
of vacancies among teacher members, unless the collective 306
bargaining agreement specifies a different method of selecting 307
such replacements. 308
(4) Whenever an administrator's coursework plan is being 309
discussed or voted upon, the local professional development 310
committee shall, at the request of one of its administrative 311
members, cause a majority of the committee to consist of 312
administrative members by reducing the number of teacher members 313
voting on the plan. 314

Sub. S. B. No. 144 Page 12
As Reported by the Senate Education Committee
(5) A professional development committee may grant an 315
individual seeking to renew a license under this section credit 316
towards continuing education requirements for completion of a 317
statutorily required professional development training. Such an 318
individual shall receive continuing education credit for one 319
completed professional development course per licensure renewal 320
period. To qualify for continuing education credit under this 321
division, a professional development course shall be completed 322
during the time in which an individual holds a valid license 323
under this section. 324
(G)(1) The state board of education, educational service 325
centers, county boards of developmental disabilities, college 326
and university departments of education, head start programs, 327
and the Ohio education computer network may establish local 328
professional development committees to determine whether the 329
coursework proposed by their employees who are licensed or 330
certificated under this section or section 3319.222 of the 331
Revised Code, or under the former version of either section as 332
it existed prior to October 16, 2009, meet the requirements of 333
the rules adopted under this section. They may establish local 334
professional development committees on their own or in 335
collaboration with a school district or other agency having 336
authority to establish them. 337
Local professional development committees established by 338
county boards of developmental disabilities shall be structured 339
in a manner comparable to the structures prescribed for school 340
districts in divisions (F)(2) and (3) of this section, as shall 341
the committees established by any other entity specified in 342
division (G)(1) of this section that provides educational 343
services by employing or contracting for services of classroom 344
teachers licensed or certificated under this section or section 345

Sub. S. B. No. 144 Page 13
As Reported by the Senate Education Committee
3319.222 of the Revised Code, or under the former version of 346
either section as it existed prior to October 16, 2009. All 347
other entities specified in division (G)(1) of this section 348
shall structure their committees in accordance with guidelines 349
which shall be issued by the state board. 350
(2) Educational service centers may establish local 351
professional development committees to serve educators who are 352
not employed in schools in this state, including pupil services 353
personnel who are licensed under this section. Local 354
professional development committees shall be structured in a 355
manner comparable to the structures prescribed for school 356
districts in divisions (F)(2) and (3) of this section. 357
These committees may agree to review the coursework, 358
continuing education units, or other equivalent activities 359
related to classroom teaching or the area of licensure that is 360
proposed by an individual who satisfies both of the following 361
conditions: 362
(a) The individual is licensed or certificated under this 363
section or under the former version of this section as it 364
existed prior to October 16, 2009. 365
(b) The individual is not currently employed as an 366
educator or is not currently employed by an entity that operates 367
a local professional development committee under this section. 368
Any committee that agrees to work with such an individual 369
shall work to determine whether the proposed coursework, 370
continuing education units, or other equivalent activities meet 371
the requirements of the rules adopted by the state board under 372
this section. 373
(3) Any public agency that is not specified in division 374

Sub. S. B. No. 144 Page 14
As Reported by the Senate Education Committee
(G)(1) or (2) of this section but provides educational services 375
and employs or contracts for services of classroom teachers 376
licensed or certificated under this section or section 3319.222 377
of the Revised Code, or under the former version of either 378
section as it existed prior to October 16, 2009, may establish a 379
local professional development committee, subject to the 380
approval of the state board. The committee shall be structured 381
in accordance with guidelines issued by the state board. 382

of this section that do both of the following: 385

school counselors from the requirement to complete any 387
additional coursework for the renewal of an educator license 388
issued under this section or section 3319.26 of the Revised 389
Code. The rules also shall specify that such teachers and school 390
counselors are exempt from any requirements prescribed by 391
professional development committees established under divisions 392
(F) and (G) of this section. 393
(2) For purposes of division (H)(1) of this section, the 394
