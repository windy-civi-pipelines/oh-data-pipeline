scope, the teacher members shall be licensed to teach such grade 237
or age levels, and shall be elected by majority vote of the 238
classroom teachers holding such a license and the principal 239

committee, upon election and appointment of all committee 259
members, shall be called by a member designated by the district 260
superintendent. At this initial meeting, the committee shall 261
select a chairperson and such other officers the committee deems 262

meetings. Thereafter, the committee shall meet at the call of 264
the chairperson or upon the filing of a petition with the 265
district superintendent signed by a majority of the committee 266
members calling for the committee to meet. 267
(3) In the case of a school district in which an exclusive 268
representative has been established pursuant to Chapter 4117. of 269
the Revised Code, professional development committees shall be 270
established in accordance with any collective bargaining 271
agreement in effect in the district that includes provisions for 272
such committees. 273
If the collective bargaining agreement does not specify a 274
different method for the selection of teacher members of the 275
committees, the exclusive representative of the district's 276
teachers shall select the teacher members. 277
If the collective bargaining agreement does not specify a 278
different structure for the committees, the board of education 279
of the school district shall establish the structure, including 280
the number of committees and the number of teacher and 281
administrative members on each committee; the specific 282
administrative members to be part of each committee; whether the 283

levels, or by type of grade or age levels for which educator 285
licenses are designated; the lengths of terms for members; the 286
manner of filling vacancies on the committees; and the frequency 287
and time and place of meetings. However, in all cases, except as 288
provided in division (F)(4) of this section, there shall be a 289
majority of teacher members of any professional development 290
committee, there shall be at least five total members of any 291
professional development committee, and the exclusive 292
representative shall designate replacement members in the case 293
of vacancies among teacher members, unless the collective 294
bargaining agreement specifies a different method of selecting 295
such replacements. 296
(4) Whenever an administrator's coursework plan is being 297
discussed or voted upon, the local professional development 298
committee shall, at the request of one of its administrative 299
members, cause a majority of the committee to consist of 300
administrative members by reducing the number of teacher members 301
voting on the plan. 302
(5) A professional development committee may grant an 303
individual seeking to renew a license under this section credit 304
towards continuing education requirements for completion of a 305
statutorily required professional development training. Such an 306
individual shall receive continuing education credit for one 307

case the one or two principals employed shall serve on the 235
committee. If a committee has a particular grade or age level 236
scope, the teacher members shall be licensed to teach such grade 237
or age levels, and shall be elected by majority vote of the 238
classroom teachers holding such a license and the principal 239

shall be filled by vote of the remaining members of the 245
committee so selected. 246

shall be prescribed by the district board establishing the 248
committees. The conduct of elections for members of professional 249

for the remainder of that term. 257
The initial meeting of any professional development 258
committee, upon election and appointment of all committee 259
members, shall be called by a member designated by the district 260
superintendent. At this initial meeting, the committee shall 261
select a chairperson and such other officers the committee deems 262
necessary, and shall adopt rules for the conduct of its 263
meetings. Thereafter, the committee shall meet at the call of 264
the chairperson or upon the filing of a petition with the 265
district superintendent signed by a majority of the committee 266
members calling for the committee to meet. 267
(3) In the case of a school district in which an exclusive 268
representative has been established pursuant to Chapter 4117. of 269
the Revised Code, professional development committees shall be 270
established in accordance with any collective bargaining 271
agreement in effect in the district that includes provisions for 272
such committees. 273
If the collective bargaining agreement does not specify a 274
different method for the selection of teacher members of the 275
committees, the exclusive representative of the district's 276
teachers shall select the teacher members. 277
If the collective bargaining agreement does not specify a 278
different structure for the committees, the board of education 279
of the school district shall establish the structure, including 280
the number of committees and the number of teacher and 281
administrative members on each committee; the specific 282
administrative members to be part of each committee; whether the 283

scope of the committees will be district levels, building 284
levels, or by type of grade or age levels for which educator 285
licenses are designated; the lengths of terms for members; the 286
manner of filling vacancies on the committees; and the frequency 287
and time and place of meetings. However, in all cases, except as 288
provided in division (F)(4) of this section, there shall be a 289
majority of teacher members of any professional development 290
committee, there shall be at least five total members of any 291
professional development committee, and the exclusive 292
representative shall designate replacement members in the case 293
of vacancies among teacher members, unless the collective 294
bargaining agreement specifies a different method of selecting 295
such replacements. 296
(4) Whenever an administrator's coursework plan is being 297
discussed or voted upon, the local professional development 298
committee shall, at the request of one of its administrative 299
members, cause a majority of the committee to consist of 300
administrative members by reducing the number of teacher members 301
voting on the plan. 302
(5) A professional development committee may grant an 303
individual seeking to renew a license under this section credit 304
towards continuing education requirements for completion of a 305
statutorily required professional development training. Such an 306
individual shall receive continuing education credit for one 307
completed professional development course per licensure renewal 308
period. To qualify for continuing education credit under this 309
division, a professional development course shall be completed 310
during the time in which an individual holds a valid license 311

the rules adopted under this section. They may establish local 322
professional development committees on their own or in 323
collaboration with a school district or other agency having 324

county boards of developmental disabilities shall be structured 327
in a manner comparable to the structures prescribed for school 328
districts in divisions (F)(2) and (3) of this section, as shall 329
