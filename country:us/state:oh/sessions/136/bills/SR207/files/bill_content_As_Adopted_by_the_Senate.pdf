WHEREAS, Opened in 1900, the Toledo Zoo and Aquarium can be 5
justly proud of its illustrious history of conservation, community 6
impact, and commitment to the future, and it has played a valuable 7
role in local endeavors as well as in projects that have reached 8
across the globe to Africa, Aruba, Brazil, Nepal, the Pacific Islands, 9
and Tasmania. Indeed, it has become a respected resource, and its many 10
outstanding accomplishments are a justifiable source of pride and an 11
excellent reflection not only on the institution itself but also on 12
its hard-working staff and volunteers; and 13
WHEREAS, Since its inception, the Toledo Zoo and Aquarium has 14
witnessed many changes, and it now stands as a testament to the growth 15
of its facilities and programs over the past one hundred twenty-five 16
years. We are certain that as this worthy endeavor maintains its 17
unfaltering devotion to service, it will continue in the tradition of 18
excellence that has become its hallmark and has enriched the lives of 19
its visitors; and 20
WHEREAS, An occasion such as this is a significant milestone that 21
represents dedication and vision, and on this special anniversary, the 22
stewards of the Toledo Zoo and Aquarium can celebrate the splendors 23
and wonders of wildlife and our natural world. We commend their 24
estimable efforts to carry this important work into the future; 25
therefore be it 26
