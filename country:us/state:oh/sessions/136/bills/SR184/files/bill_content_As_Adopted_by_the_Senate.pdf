A R E S O L U T I O N
In memory of Phillip Corbet Wagner.
WHEREAS, The members of the Senate of the 136th General Assembly 1
of Ohio offer our profound sympathies to the family and friends of 2
Phillip Corbet Wagner on the sorrowful occasion of his death; and 3
WHEREAS, Phil Wagner will long be regarded as a remarkable 4
individual who contributed a great deal to his community and state. A 5
proud veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, he served as a member of the 6
Sheffield Village Police Department before becoming an officer with 7
the Lorain Police Department, which posthumously awarded him a Purple 8
Heart and a Medal of Honor, and it is our sincere hope that his memory 9
will be a source of comfort to those who loved and cherished him, 10
including his wife, Jessica, and his three children; and 11
WHEREAS, Giving freely of his time, energy, and abilities far 12
beyond what was required or expected, Phil Wagner displayed 13
exceptional civic concern and insight, and his exemplary efforts will 14
certainly live beyond him. Indeed, the warmth and understanding he so 15
readily extended to others will stand as a testament to his personal 16
character, and his memory will remain forever in the hearts of all who 17
knew him; and 18
WHEREAS, At a time when many people are content to take a passive 19
role in life, law enforcement officers often risk their own safety, 20
and in fact their lives, to ensure the well-being of their fellow 21
citizens. The devotion to duty that Phil Wagner showed in all of his 22
endeavors earned him the genuine respect and gratitude of his 23
colleagues and of the community he so capably served; therefore be it 24
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the Senate of the 136th General 25
Assembly of Ohio, in adopting this Resolution, express a deep sense of 26

loss and sincere regret at the death of Phillip Corbet Wagner; and be 27
it further 28
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit a duly 29
authenticated copy of this Resolution to the family of Phillip Corbet 30
Wagner. 31
