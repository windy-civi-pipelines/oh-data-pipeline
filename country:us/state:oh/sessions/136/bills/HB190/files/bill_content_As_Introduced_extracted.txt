(b) Prior to providing instruction that includes sexuality 23
content or permitting a third party to provide such instruction 24
on behalf of the district, provide parents the opportunity to 25
review any instructional material that includes sexuality 26
content. Upon request of the student's parent, a student shall 27
be excused from instruction that includes sexuality content and 28
be permitted to participate in an alternative assignment. 29
(2) Promptly notify a student's parent of any substantial 30
change in the student's services, including counseling services, 31
or monitoring related to the student's mental, emotional, or 32
physical health or well-being or the school's ability to provide 33
a safe and supportive learning environment for the student. The 34

notified of any substantial change in the student's services. 36
The policy shall specify that notice to parents shall 37

services or monitoring as provided in this section. 65
(b) Prior to providing a health care service to a student, 66
notify a parent whether the service is required to be provided 67

a student to access the service exist. This requirement may be 69
satisfied by an annual notice to parents at the beginning of the 70
school year. 71

concern. A parent may appeal a principal's or assistant 83
principal's decision to the superintendent of that district. 84
If a parent appeals the principal's or assistant 85
principal's decision, the superintendent, or a designee of the 86
superintendent, shall conduct a hearing on the decision. Based 87
on the findings of that hearing, the superintendent shall decide 88
whether to affirm the principal's or assistant principal's 89
decision. If the superintendent does not affirm the decision, 90
the superintendent shall determine a resolution to the parent's 91
concern. A parent may appeal the superintendent's decision to 92
the board of education of the school district. The board shall 93
review the superintendent's decision and, if the board 94

Section 1. That sections 3313.473, 3314.03, 3326.11, and 6
3328.24 be amended and section 3313.475 of the Revised Code be 7
enacted to read as follows: 8
Sec. 3313.473. (A) The general assembly maintains that a 9
parent has a fundamental right to make decisions concerning the 10
upbringing, education, and care of the parent's child. 11
(B) Not later than the first day of July following the 12
effective date of this sectionJuly 1, 2025, the board of 13
education of each city, local, exempted village, and joint 14
vocational school district shall develop and adopt a policy to 15
promote parental involvement in the public school system. The 16
policy shall require a school district to do all of the 17
following: 18
(1)(a) Ensure that any sexuality content is age- 19

H. B. No. 190 Page 2
As Introduced
appropriate and developmentally appropriate for the age of the 20
student receiving the instruction, regardless of the age or 21
grade level of the student. 22
(b) Prior to providing instruction that includes sexuality 23
content or permitting a third party to provide such instruction 24
on behalf of the district, provide parents the opportunity to 25
review any instructional material that includes sexuality 26
content. Upon request of the student's parent, a student shall 27
be excused from instruction that includes sexuality content and 28
be permitted to participate in an alternative assignment. 29
(2) Promptly notify a student's parent of any substantial 30
change in the student's services, including counseling services, 31
or monitoring related to the student's mental, emotional, or 32
physical health or well-being or the school's ability to provide 33
a safe and supportive learning environment for the student. The 34
policy shall specify in what manner a student's parent will be 35
notified of any substantial change in the student's services. 36
The policy shall specify that notice to parents shall 37
reinforce the fundamental right of parents to make decisions 38
regarding the upbringing and control of their children, and that 39
the school district shall not inhibit parental access to the 40
student's education and health records maintained by the school. 41
(3) Prohibit school district personnel from directly or 42
indirectly encouraging a student to withhold from a parent 43
information concerning the student's mental, emotional, or 44
physical health or well-being, or a change in related services 45
or monitoring. 46
The policy shall prohibit school district personnel from 47

prior to providing any type of health care service to the 52
student, including physical, mental, and behavioral health care 53

(a) At the beginning of the school year, notify parents of 58
each health care service offered at, or facilitated in 59
cooperation with, their student's school and their option to 60
withhold consent or decline any specified service. Parental 61
consent to health care services does not waive the parent's 62
right to access the parent's student's educational or health 63
records or to be notified about a change in the student's 64
services or monitoring as provided in this section. 65
(b) Prior to providing a health care service to a student, 66
notify a parent whether the service is required to be provided 67
by the school district under state law and if other options for 68
a student to access the service exist. This requirement may be 69
satisfied by an annual notice to parents at the beginning of the 70
school year. 71
Division (B)(4) of this section does not apply to 72
emergency situations, first aid, other unanticipated minor 73
health care services, or health care services provided pursuant 74

within thirty days after their receipt. Under the policy, school 81
districts shall notify parents of their right to file a written 82
concern. A parent may appeal a principal's or assistant 83
principal's decision to the superintendent of that district. 84
If a parent appeals the principal's or assistant 85
principal's decision, the superintendent, or a designee of the 86
superintendent, shall conduct a hearing on the decision. Based 87
on the findings of that hearing, the superintendent shall decide 88
whether to affirm the principal's or assistant principal's 89
decision. If the superintendent does not affirm the decision, 90
the superintendent shall determine a resolution to the parent's 91
concern. A parent may appeal the superintendent's decision to 92
the board of education of the school district. The board shall 93
review the superintendent's decision and, if the board 94
determines it necessary, hold a hearing on the decision and, 95
based on that hearing, either affirm the superintendent's 96
decision or determine a new resolution to the parent's concern. 97
