the proposed rules, amendments, or rescissions to which the 440
notice applies.) The proposed rule, amendment, or rescission is 441
subject to legislative review and invalidation under sections 442
106.02, 106.021, and 106.022 of the Revised Code. If the agency 443
makes a revision in a proposed rule, amendment, or rescission 444
after it is filed with the joint committee, the agency promptly 445
shall file the full text of the proposed rule, amendment, or 446
rescission in its revised form in electronic form with the joint 447
committee. 448
An agency shall file the rule summary and fiscal analysis 449
prepared under section 106.024 of the Revised Code in electronic 450
form along with a proposed rule, amendment, or rescission, and 451
along with a proposed rule, amendment, or rescission in revised 452
form, that is filed under this division. 453
If a proposed rule, amendment, or rescission has an 454

S. B. No. 268 Page 17
As Introduced
adverse impact on businesses, the agency also shall file the 455
business impact analysis, any recommendations received from the 456
common sense initiative office, and the agency's memorandum of 457
response, if any, in electronic form along with the proposed 458
rule, amendment, or rescission, or along with the proposed rule, 459
amendment, or rescission in revised form, that is filed under 460
this division. 461
The agency shall file the hearing report in electronic 462
form with the joint committee before the joint committee holds 463
its public hearing on the proposed rule, amendment, or 464
rescission. The filing of a hearing report does not constitute a 465
revision of the proposed rule, amendment, or rescission to which 466
the hearing report relates. 467
If the proposed rule, amendment, or rescission requires 468
liability insurance, a bond, or any other financial 469
responsibility instrument as a condition of licensure, the 470
agency shall conduct a diligent search to determine if the 471
liability insurance, bond, or other financial responsibility 472
instrument is readily available in the amounts required as a 473
condition of licensure, and shall certify to the joint committee 474
that the search was conducted. 475
If the proposed rule, amendment, or rescission implements 476
a federal law or rule, the agency shall provide to the joint 477
committee a citation to the federal law or rule the proposed 478
rule, amendment, or rescission implements and a statement as to 479
whether the proposed rule implements the federal law or rule in 480
a manner that is more or less stringent or burdensome than the 481
federal law or rule requires. 482
A proposed rule, amendment, or rescission that is subject 483
to legislative review under this division may not be adopted 484

S. B. No. 268 Page 18
As Introduced
under division (E) of this section or filed in final form under 485
section 119.04 of the Revised Code unless the proposed rule, 486
amendment, or rescission has been filed with the joint committee 487
on agency rule review under this division and the time for 488
legislative review of the proposed rule, amendment, or 489
rescission has expired without adoption of a concurrent 490
resolution to invalidate the proposed rule, amendment, or 491
rescission. 492
This division does not apply to: 493
(1) An emergency rule, amendment, or rescission; 494
(2) A proposed rule, amendment, or rescission that must be 495
adopted verbatim by an agency pursuant to federal law or rule, 496
to become effective within sixty days of adoption, in order to 497
continue the operation of a federally reimbursed program in this 498
state, so long as the proposed rule contains both of the 499
following: 500
(a) A statement that it is proposed for the purpose of 501
complying with a federal law or rule; 502
(b) A citation to the federal law or rule that requires 503
verbatim compliance. 504
(3) A proposed rule, amendment, or rescission that, as set 505
forth in section 3719.41 of the Revised Code, must be adopted by 506
the state board of pharmacy pursuant to federal law or rule, to 507
become effective within sixty days of adoption, so long as the 508
proposed rule contains a statement that it is proposed for the 509
purpose of complying with federal law or rule. 510
If a rule or amendment is exempt from legislative review 511
under division (C)(2) of this section, and if the federal law or 512
rule pursuant to which the rule or amendment was adopted 513

S. B. No. 268 Page 19
As Introduced
expires, is repealed or rescinded, or otherwise terminates, the 514
rule or amendment, or its rescission, is thereafter subject to 515
legislative review under division (C) of this section. 516
(D) On the date and at the time and place designated in 517
the notice, the agency shall conduct a public hearing at which 518
any person affected by the proposed action of the agency may 519
appear and be heard in person, by the person's attorney, or 520
both, may present the person's position, arguments, or 521
contentions, orally or in writing, offer and examine witnesses, 522
and present evidence tending to show that the proposed rule, 523
amendment, or rescission, if adopted or effectuated, will be 524
unreasonable or unlawful. An agency may permit persons affected 525
by the proposed rule, amendment, or rescission to present their 526
positions, arguments, or contentions in writing, not only at the 527
hearing, but also for a reasonable period before, after, or both 528
before and after the hearing. A person who presents a position 529
or arguments or contentions in writing before or after the 530
hearing is not required to appear at the hearing. 531
At the hearing, the testimony shall be recorded. Such 532
record shall be made at the expense of the agency. The agency is 533
required to transcribe a record that is not sight readable only 534
if a person requests transcription of all or part of the record 535
and agrees to reimburse the agency for the costs of the 536
transcription. An agency may require the person to pay in 537
advance all or part of the cost of the transcription. 538
In any hearing under this section the agency may 539
administer oaths or affirmations. 540
The agency shall consider the positions, arguments, or 541
contentions presented at, or before or after, the hearing. The 542
agency shall prepare a hearing summary of the positions, 543

S. B. No. 268 Page 20
As Introduced
arguments, or contentions, and of the issues raised by the 544
positions, arguments, or contentions. The agency then shall 545
prepare a hearing report explaining, with regard to each issue, 546
how it is reflected in the rule, amendment, or rescission. If an 547
issue is not reflected in the rule, amendment, or rescission, 548
the hearing report shall explain why the issue is not reflected. 549
The agency shall include the hearing summary in the hearing 550
report as an appendix thereto. And, in the hearing report, the 551
agency shall identify the proposed rule, amendment, or 552
rescission to which the hearing report relates. 553
(E) After divisions (A), (B), (C), and (D) of this section 554
have been complied with, and when the time for legislative 555
review under sections 106.02, 106.022, and 106.023 of the 556
Revised Code has expired without adoption of a concurrent 557
resolution to invalidate the proposed rule, amendment, or 558
rescission, the agency may issue an order adopting the proposed 559
rule or the proposed amendment or rescission of the rule, 560
consistent with the synopsis or general statement included in 561
the public notice. At that time the agency shall designate the 562
effective date of the rule, amendment, or rescission, which 563
shall not be earlier than the tenth day after the rule, 564
amendment, or rescission has been filed in its final form as 565
provided in section 119.04 of the Revised Code. 566
(F) Prior to the effective date of a rule, amendment, or 567
rescission, the agency shall make a reasonable effort to inform 568
those affected by the rule, amendment, or rescission and to have 569
available for distribution to those requesting it the full text 570
of the rule as adopted or as amended. 571
(G)(1) If the governor, upon the request of an agency, 572
determines that an emergency requires the immediate adoption, 573

S. B. No. 268 Page 21

amendment, or rescission of a rule, the governor shall issue an 574
order, the text of which shall be filed in electronic form with 575
the agency, the secretary of state, the director of the 576
legislative service commission, and the joint committee on 577
agency rule review, that the procedure prescribed by this 578
section with respect to the adoption, amendment, or rescission 579
of a specified rule is suspended. The agency may then adopt 580
immediately the emergency rule, amendment, or rescission and it 581
becomes effective on the date the rule, amendment, or 582
rescission, in final form and in compliance with division (A)(2) 583
of section 119.04 of the Revised Code, is filed in electronic 584
form with the secretary of state, the director of the 585
legislative service commission, and the joint committee on 586
agency rule review. The director shall publish the full text of 587
the emergency rule, amendment, or rescission in the register of 588
Ohio. 589
Except as provided in division (G)(2) of this section, or 590
section 107.43 of the Revised Code, the emergency rule, 591
amendment, or rescission shall become invalid at the end of the 592
one hundred twentieth day it is in effect. Prior to that date 593
the agency may adopt the emergency rule, amendment, or 594
rescission as a nonemergency rule, amendment, or rescission by 595
complying with the procedure prescribed by this section for the 596
adoption, amendment, and rescission of nonemergency rules. The 597
agency shall not use the procedure of division (G)(1) of this 598
section to readopt the emergency rule, amendment, or rescission 599
so that, upon the emergency rule, amendment, or rescission 600
becoming invalid under division (G)(1) of this section, the 601
emergency rule, amendment, or rescission will continue in effect 602
without interruption for another one-hundred-twenty-day period, 603
except when section 106.02 of the Revised Code prevents the 604

S. B. No. 268 Page 22

agency from adopting the emergency rule, amendment, or 605
rescission as a nonemergency rule, amendment, or rescission 606
within the one-hundred-twenty-day period. 607
Division (G)(1) of this section does not apply to the 608
adoption of any emergency rule, amendment, or rescission by the 609
tax commissioner under division (C)(2) of section 5117.02 of the 610
Revised Code. 611
(2) An emergency rule or amendment adding a substance to a 612
controlled substance schedule shall become invalid at the end of 613
the one hundred eightieth day it is in effect. Prior to that 614
date, the state board of pharmacy may adopt the emergency rule 615
or amendment as a nonemergency rule or amendment by complying 616
with the procedure prescribed by this section for adoption and 617
amendment of nonemergency rules. The board shall not use the 618
procedure of division (G)(1) of this section to readopt the 619
emergency rule or amendment so that, upon the emergency rule or 620
amendment becoming invalid under division (G)(2) of this 621
section, the emergency rule or amendment will continue in effect 622
beyond the one-hundred-eighty-day period. 623
(3) The general assembly, by adopting a concurrent 624
resolution, and in accordance with section 107.43 of the Revised 625
Code, may do either of the following: 626
(a) Invalidate, in whole or in part, an emergency rule 627
adopted or amended by an agency in response to a state of 628
emergency, as defined under section 107.42 of the Revised Code, 629
under division (G)(1) of this section; 630
(b) Authorize an agency to readopt, in whole or in part, a 631
rule that was rescinded in response to a state of emergency 632
under division (G)(1) of this section. 633

(H) Rules adopted by an authority within the department of 634
job and family services for the administration or enforcement of 635
Chapter 4141. of the Revised Code or of the department of 636
taxation shall be effective without a hearing as provided by 637
this section if the statutes pertaining to such agency 638
specifically give a right of appeal to the board of tax appeals 639
or to a higher authority within the agency or to a court, and 640
also give the appellant a right to a hearing on such appeal. 641
This division does not apply to the adoption of any rule, 642
amendment, or rescission by the tax commissioner under division 643
(C)(1) or (2) of section 5117.02 of the Revised Code, or deny 644
