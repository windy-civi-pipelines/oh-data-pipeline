the agency's order is not supported by reliable, probative, and 778
substantial evidence and is not in accordance with law. The 779
notice of appeal shall also be filed by the appellant with the 780
court. In filing a notice of appeal with the agency or court, 781
the notice that is filed may be either the original notice or a 782
copy of the original notice. Unless otherwise provided by law 783
relating to a particular agency, notices of appeal shall be 784
filed within fifteen days after the service of the notice of the 785
agency's order as provided in section 119.05 of the Revised 786
Code. For purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a 787
determination appealed pursuant to division (C) of section 788

Section 204:
119.092 of the Revised Code. The amendments made to this 789
paragraph by Sub. H.B. 215 of the 128th general assembly are 790
procedural, and this paragraph as amended by those amendments 791
shall be applied retrospectively to all appeals pursuant to this 792
paragraph filed before September 13, 2010, but not earlier than 793
May 7, 2009, which was the date the supreme court of Ohio 794
released its opinion and judgment in Medcorp, Inc. v. Ohio 795
Dep't. of Job and Family Servs. (2009), 121 Ohio St.3d 622. 796
(E) The filing of a notice of appeal shall not 797
automatically operate as a suspension of the order of an agency. 798
If it appears to the court that an unusual hardship to the 799
appellant will result from the execution of the agency's order 800
pending determination of the appeal, the court may grant a 801
suspension and fix its terms. If an appeal is taken from the 802
judgment of the court and the court has previously granted a 803
suspension of the agency's order as provided in this section, 804
the suspension of the agency's order shall not be vacated and 805
shall be given full force and effect until the matter is finally 806

an appeal from the Ohio casino control commission, the state 810
medical board, or the state chiropractic board, the court may 811
grant a suspension and fix its terms if it appears to the court 812
that an unusual hardship to the appellant will result from the 813
execution of the agency's order pending determination of the 814
appeal and the health, safety, and welfare of the public will 815
not be threatened by suspension of the order. This provision 816
shall not be construed to limit the factors the court may 817
consider in determining whether to suspend an order of any other 818
agency pending determination of an appeal. 819
(F) The final order of adjudication may apply to any 820
renewal of a license or permit which has been granted during the 821
period of the appeal. 822

the time allowed, upon motion, shall cause the court to enter a 877
finding in favor of the party adversely affected. Additional 878
time, however, may be granted by the court, not to exceed thirty 879
days, when it is shown that the agency has made substantial 880
effort to comply. The record shall be prepared and transcribed, 881
and the expense of it shall be taxed as a part of the costs on 882
the appeal. The appellant shall provide security for costs 883
satisfactory to the court of common pleas. Upon demand by any 884
interested party, the agency shall furnish at the cost of the 885
party requesting it a copy of the stenographic report of 886
testimony offered and evidence submitted at any hearing and a 887
copy of the complete record. 888

youth athletic park organization, a statement issued by a board 3659
or body vested with authority under Chapter 755. of the Revised 3660

facilities in the territory in which the organization is 3662
located, certifying that the playing fields owned by the 3663
organization were open for use to all residents of that 3664
territory, regardless of race, color, creed, religion, sex, or 3665
national origin, for athletic activities by youth athletic 3666
organizations that do not discriminate on the basis of race, 3667
color, creed, religion, sex, or national origin, and that the 3668
fields were not used for any profit-making activity at any time 3669
during the year. That type of board or body is authorized to 3670
issue the statement upon request and shall issue the statement 3671
if it finds that the applicant's playing fields were so used. 3672

any rights to the applicant except those rights specifically 3685
granted in section 119.06 of the Revised Code. The issuance of a 3686

the applicant committed, or actions that the applicant failed to 3690
take, before or after the issuance of the temporary permit. 3691

granting with limits, restrictions, or probationary conditions, 3705
or denying an initial license application, the attorney general 3706
commission may grant a temporary license and request additional 3707
time to conduct the investigation if the attorney general 3708
commission has cause to believe that additional time is 3709
necessary to complete the investigation and has notified the 3710
applicant in writing about the specific concerns raised during 3711
the investigation. 3712

chapter shall be reduced by three-fourths of one per cent of the 6314
total amount wagered for those permit holders who make capital 6315
improvements to existing race tracks or construct new race 6316
tracks. The percentage of the reduction that may be taken each 6317
racing day shall equal seventy-five per cent of the taxes levied 6318
under divisions (B) and (C) of this section and section 3769.087 6319
of the Revised Code, and division (F)(2) of section 3769.26 of 6320
the Revised Code, as applicable, divided by the calculated 6321

Otherwise, the permit holder shall receive the full reduction 6328
provided for in this division. The amount of the allowable 6329
reduction not received shall be carried forward and applied 6330
against future tax liability. After any reductions expire, any 6331
reduction carried forward shall be treated as a reduction as 6332
provided for in this division. 6333

If more than one permit holder is authorized to conduct 6334
racing at the facility that is being built or improved, the cost 6335
of the new race track or capital improvement shall be allocated 6336
between or among all the permit holders in the ratio that the 6337
permit holders' number of racing days bears to the total number 6338
of racing days conducted at the facility. 6339
A reduction for a new race track or a capital improvement 6340
shall start from the day racing is first conducted following the 6341
date actual construction of the new race track or each capital 6342
improvement is completed and the construction cost has been 6343
approved by the racing commission, unless otherwise provided in 6344
this section. A reduction for a new race track or a capital 6345
improvement shall continue for a period of twenty-five years for 6346
new race tracks and for fifteen years for capital improvements 6347
if the construction of the capital improvement or new race track 6348
commenced prior to March 29, 1988, and for a period of ten years 6349
for new race tracks or capital improvements if the construction 6350
of the capital improvement or new race track commenced on or 6351
after March 29, 1988, but before June 6, 2001, or until the 6352
total tax reduction reaches seventy per cent of the approved 6353
cost of the new race track or capital improvement, as allocated 6354
to each permit holder, whichever occurs first. A reduction for a 6355
new race track or a capital improvement approved after June 6, 6356
2001, shall continue until the total tax reduction reaches one 6357
hundred per cent of the approved cost of the new race track or 6358
capital improvement, as allocated to each permit holder. 6359
A reduction granted for a new race track or a capital 6360
improvement, the application for which was approved by the 6361
racing commission after March 29, 1988, but before June 6, 2001, 6362
shall not commence nor shall the ten-year period begin to run 6363
until all prior tax reductions with respect to the same race 6364

track have ended. The total tax reduction because of capital 6365
improvements shall not during any one year exceed for all permit 6366
holders using any one track three-fourths of one per cent of the 6367
total amount wagered, regardless of the number of capital 6368
improvements made. Several capital improvements to a race track 6369
may be consolidated in an application if the racing commission 6370
approved the application prior to March 29, 1988. No permit 6371
holder may receive a tax reduction for a capital improvement 6372
approved by the racing commission on or after March 29, 1988, at 6373
a race track until all tax reductions have ended for all prior 6374
capital improvements approved by the racing commission under 6375
this section or section 3769.20 of the Revised Code at that race 6376
track. If there are two or more permit holders operating 6377
meetings at the same track, they may consolidate their 6378
applications. The racing commission shall notify the tax 6379
commissioner when the reduction of tax begins and when it ends. 6380
Each fiscal year the racing commission shall submit a 6381
report to the tax commissioner, the office of budget and 6382
management, and the legislative service commission. The report 6383
shall identify each capital improvement project undertaken under 6384
this division and in progress at each race track, indicate the 6385
total cost of each project, state the tax reduction that 6386
resulted from each project during the immediately preceding 6387
fiscal year, estimate the tax reduction that will result from 6388
each project during the current fiscal year, state the total tax 6389
reduction that resulted from all such projects at all race 6390
tracks during the immediately preceding fiscal year, and 6391
estimate the total tax reduction that will result from all such 6392
projects at all race tracks during the current fiscal year. 6393
(2) In order to qualify for the reduction in tax, a permit 6394
holder shall apply to the racing commission in such form as the 6395

commission may require and shall provide full details of the new 6396
race track or capital improvement, including a schedule for its 6397
construction and completion, and set forth the costs and 6398
expenses incurred in connection with it. The racing commission 6399
shall not approve an application unless the permit holder shows 6400
that a contract for the new race track or capital improvement 6401
has been let under an unrestricted competitive bidding 6402
procedure, unless the contract is exempted by the controlling 6403
board because of its unusual nature. In determining whether to 6404
approve an application, the racing commission shall consider 6405
whether the new race track or capital improvement will promote 6406
the safety, convenience, and comfort of the racing public and 6407
horse owners and generally tend towards the improvement of 6408
racing in this state. 6409
(3) If a new race track or capital improvement is approved 6410
by the racing commission and construction has started, the tax 6411
reduction may be authorized by the commission upon presentation 6412
of copies of paid bills in excess of one hundred thousand 6413
dollars or ten per cent of the approved cost, whichever is 6414
greater. After the initial authorization, the permit holder 6415
shall present copies of paid bills. If the permit holder is in 6416
substantial compliance with the schedule for construction and 6417
completion of the new race track or capital improvement, the 6418
racing commission may authorize the continuation of the tax 6419
reduction upon the presentation of the additional paid bills. 6420
The total amount of the tax reduction authorized shall not 6421
exceed the percentage of the approved cost of the new race track 6422
or capital improvement specified in division (J)(1) of this 6423

Section 382:
section. The racing commission may terminate any tax reduction 6424
immediately if a permit holder fails to complete the new race 6425
track or capital improvement, or to substantially comply with 6426
S. B. No. 197 Page 221
As Introduced
the schedule for construction and completion of the new race 6427
track or capital improvement. If a permit holder fails to 6428
complete a new race track or capital improvement, the racing 6429
commission shall order the permit holder to repay to the state 6430
the total amount of tax reduced. The normal tax paid by the 6431
permit holder shall be increased by three-fourths of one per 6432
cent of the total amount wagered until the total amount of the 6433
additional tax collected equals the total amount of tax reduced. 6434
(4) As used in this section: 6435
(a) "Capital improvement" means an addition, replacement, 6436
or remodeling of a structural unit of a race track facility 6437
costing at least one hundred thousand dollars, including, but 6438
not limited to, the construction of barns used exclusively for 6439
the race track facility, backstretch facilities for horsemen, 6440
paddock facilities, new pari-mutuel and totalizator equipment 6441
and appurtenances to that equipment purchased by the track, new 6442
access roads, new parking areas, the complete reconstruction, 6443
reshaping, and leveling of the racing surface and appurtenances, 6444
the installation of permanent new heating or air conditioning, 6445
roof replacement or restoration, installations of a permanent 6446
nature forming a part of the track structure, and construction 6447
of buildings that are located on a permit holder's premises. 6448
"Capital improvement" does not include the cost of replacement 6449
of equipment that is not permanently installed, ordinary 6450
repairs, painting, and maintenance required to keep a race track 6451
facility in ordinary operating condition. 6452
(b) "New race track" includes the reconstruction of a race 6453
track damaged by fire or other cause that has been declared by 6454
the racing commission, as a result of the damage, to be an 6455
inadequate facility for the safe operation of horse racing. 6456
S. B. No. 197 Page 222
As Introduced
(c) "Approved cost" includes all debt service and interest 6457
costs that are associated with a capital improvement or new race 6458
track and that the racing commission approves for a tax 6459
reduction under division (J) of this section. 6460
(5) The racing commission shall not approve an application 6461
for a tax reduction under this section if it has reasonable 6462
cause to believe that the actions or negligence of the permit 6463
holder substantially contributed to the damage suffered by the 6464
track due to fire or other cause. The racing commission shall 6465
obtain any data or information available from a fire marshal, 6466
law enforcement official, or insurance company concerning any 6467
fire or other damage suffered by a track, prior to approving an 6468
application for a tax reduction. 6469
(6) The approved cost to which a tax reduction applies 6470
shall be determined by generally accepted accounting principles 6471
and verified by an audit of the permit holder's records upon 6472
completion of the project by the racing commission, or by an 6473
independent certified public accountant selected by the permit 6474
holder and approved by the commission. 6475
(K) No other license or excise tax or fee, except as 6476
provided in sections 3769.01 to 3769.14 of the Revised Code, 6477
shall be assessed or collected from such licensee by any county, 6478
township, district, municipal corporation, or other body having 6479
power to assess or collect a tax or fee. That portion of the tax 6480
paid under this section by permit holders for racing conducted 6481
at and during the course of an agricultural exposition or fair, 6482
and that portion of the tax that would have been paid by 6483
eligible permit holders into the nursing home franchise permit 6484
fee fund as a result of racing conducted at and during the 6485
course of an agricultural exposition or fair, shall be deposited 6486
S. B. No. 197 Page 223
As Introduced
into the state treasury to the credit of the horse racing tax 6487
fund, which is hereby created for the use of the agricultural 6488
societies of the several counties in which the taxes originate. 6489
The state racing commission shall determine eligible permit 6490
holders for purposes of the preceding sentence, taking into 6491
account the breed of horse, the racing dates, the geographic 6492
proximity to the fair, and the best interests of Ohio racing. On 6493
the first day of any month on which there is money in the fund, 6494
the tax commissioner shall provide for payment to the treasurer 6495
of each agricultural society the amount of the taxes collected 6496
under this section upon racing conducted at and during the 6497
course of any exposition or fair conducted by the society. 6498
(L) From the tax paid under this section by harness track 6499
permit holders, the tax commissioner shall pay into the Ohio 6500
thoroughbred race fund a sum equal to a percentage of the amount 6501
wagered upon which the tax is paid. The percentage shall be 6502
determined by the tax commissioner and shall be rounded to the 6503
nearest one-hundredth. The percentage shall be such that, when 6504
multiplied by the amount wagered upon which tax was paid by the 6505
harness track permit holders in the most recent year for which 6506
final figures are available, it results in a sum that 6507
substantially equals the same amount of tax paid by the tax 6508
commissioner during that year into the Ohio fairs fund from 6509
taxes paid by thoroughbred permit holders. This division does 6510
not apply to county and independent fairs and agricultural 6511
societies. 6512
(M) Twenty-five per cent of the taxes levied on 6513
thoroughbred racing permit holders, harness racing permit 6514
holders, and quarter horse racing permit holders under this 6515

Section 383:
section, division (A) of section 3769.087 of the Revised Code, 6516

commissioner shall pay any money remaining, after the payment 6519
into the nursing home franchise permit fee fund and the 6520
reductions provided for in division (J) of this section and in 6521

Section 384:
section 3769.20 of the Revised Code, into the Ohio fairs fund, 6522
Ohio thoroughbred race fund, Ohio standardbred development fund, 6523
and state racing casino control commission operating fund as 6524
prescribed in this section and division (A) of section 3769.087 6525
of the Revised Code. The tax commissioner shall thereafter use 6526
and apply the balance of the money paid as a tax by any permit 6527
holder to cover any shortage in the accounts of such funds 6528
resulting from an insufficient payment as a tax by any other 6529

are simulcast from facilities located outside this state. If 7089
only one racing meeting of a particular breed of horse is being 7090
held, no fewer than nine live horse races shall be held on a 7091
live racing day. If, during the course of a racing meeting at a 7092
standardbred track, the racing secretary of the permit holder 7093
determines that there is an insufficient number of entries to 7094
have a full field of eight horses for each of nine races on a 7095
live racing program, then the racing secretary of the permit 7096
holder, after consultation with the Ohio harness horsemens 7097

which pari-mutuel wagering is conducted, including both live 7111
races and races simulcast from other facilities located either 7112
inside or outside this state, shall be part of a live racing 7113

(9) "Special racing event" means individual races in live 7137
racing programs or simulcast racing programs, and simulcast 7138
racing programs on special event days under division (C) of this 7139

Section 398:
section, conducted at facilities located outside this state for 7140
which the track, racing association, or state regulatory agency 7141
conducting such races charges a simulcast host a fee for the 7142
privilege of receiving a simulcast of such races into this state 7143
that is higher than the customary and regular fee charged for 7144
simulcast races because of the status or popularity of such 7145

(B)(1)(a) (A)(1)(a) The state racing commission shall, 7147
upon request by any permit holder, permit electronically 7148
televised simulcasts of horse races at the permit holder's track 7149
or enclosure on racing days authorized by the permit holder's 7150
permit. Except as provided in division (B)(A) of this section, 7151
the commission shall not permit the simulcast of any simulcast 7152
racing program conducted at tracks or facilities located outside 7153
this state unless the out-of-state simulcast racing program is 7154
available at the same signal rate to all permit holders, whether 7155
serving as simulcast hosts or simulcast guests, and all 7156
satellite facilities, in this state open and operating on that 7157
day. A permit holder or satellite facility may inform the 7158
commission that it waives the right to receive the simulcast of 7159
a simulcast racing program or a race in a simulcast racing 7160
program on that day and in this event the simulcast racing 7161
program or simulcast race shall be available to all other 7162
simulcast hosts, simulcast guests, and satellite facilities open 7163
and operating in this state on that day. 7164
(b) In order for a permit holder to offer simulcasts of 7165
horse races conducted at facilities located outside this state, 7166
the permit holder shall have conducted live racing programs 7167
during the immediately preceding calendar year on a number of 7168
days that is not less than the number of regular live racing 7169
days it conducted in calendar year 1991, not including 7170
additional racing days conducted in calendar year 1991 by the 7171
permit holder at a winterized facility under a permit issued 7172
under section 3769.07 of the Revised Code, as certified by the 7173
commission. In satisfying the foregoing requirement for live 7174
racing days during the immediately preceding calendar year, a 7175
permit holder may include the number of days on which live 7176
S. B. No. 197 Page 246

racing programs were conducted under a permit issued under 7177

Section 399:
section 3769.07 of the Revised Code for additional racing days 7178
at a winterized facility. In addition, in order for a permit 7179
holder to offer simulcasts of horse races conducted at 7180
facilities located outside this state, the permit holder shall 7181
offer all simulcasts of horse races conducted in this state made 7182
available to it. 7183
In order for a permit holder to offer simulcasts of races 7184
conducted at race tracks located outside this state at the same 7185
time and during the hours in which the live races of a live 7186
racing program are being conducted at its track, a permit holder 7187
conducting a thoroughbred live racing program shall obtain the 7188
consent of the thoroughbred horsemens association and a permit 7189
holder conducting a harness live racing program shall obtain the 7190
consent of the Ohio harness horsemens association. The consent 7191
of the horsemen's organization shall not be unreasonably 7192
withheld, and shall be consistent with the interest of 7193
preserving live racing in this state. If a horsemen's 7194
organization withholds its consent, the permit holder may file 7195
an objection with the commission, which shall promptly consider 7196
the objection and determine whether the horsemen's 7197
organization's action in withholding consent is without 7198
substantial merit and, if the commission so determines, shall 7199
authorize the permit holder to simulcast the simulcast racing 7200
programs. The determination of the commission is final. A permit 7201
holder, as a simulcast host, may offer simulcast racing programs 7202
at its track or enclosure of races conducted at tracks and 7203
facilities located outside this state prior to the commencement 7204
of, and following the conclusion of, its live races without 7205
obtaining the consent of a horsemen's organization under this 7206
division. 7207

(c) Division (B)(1)(b) (A)(1)(b) of this section remains 7208
in effect for each permit holder until the calendar year after 7209
that permit holder first receives a commission as a lottery 7210
sales agent for conducting video lottery terminal gaming on 7211
behalf of the state. 7212
(2) Notwithstanding section 3769.07 of the Revised Code 7213
and unless otherwise agreed to by the applicable horsemen's 7214
association and the permit holder, beginning in the calendar 7215
year after the permit holder first receives video lottery 7216
terminal income, one of the following applies as determined on a 7217
yearly basis: 7218
(a) If eleven per cent of the gross gaming revenue from 7219
video lottery terminals at the permit holder's facilities 7220
(either existing or relocated) in the previous calendar year 7221
exceeds fifteen million dollars, a permit holder shall conduct a 7222
minimum of one hundred twenty-five live racing days. 7223
(b) If eleven per cent of the gross gaming revenue from 7224
video lottery terminals at the permit holder's facilities 7225
(either existing or relocated) in the previous calendar year 7226
exceeds eleven million dollars, but is less than or equal to 7227
fifteen million dollars, a permit holder shall conduct a minimum 7228
of one hundred live racing days or the number of racing days 7229
applied for by the permit holder in calendar year 2012, 7230
whichever is greater. 7231
(c) If eleven per cent of the gross gaming revenue from 7232
video lottery terminals at the permit holder's facilities 7233
(either existing or relocated) in the previous calendar year is 7234
less than or equal to eleven million dollars, a permit holder 7235
shall conduct a minimum of seventy-five racing days or the 7236
number of racing days applied for by the permit holder for 7237
S. B. No. 197 Page 248
As Introduced
calendar year 2012, whichever is greater. 7238
In no case shall the minimum number of racing days for any 7239
permit holder exceed one hundred twenty-five racing days. 7240
(3) For the purposes of division (B)(2)(A)(2) of this 7241

Section 400:
section, for live racing conducted at a track with more than one 7242
permit, the minimum live racing days shall apply to those 7243
permits collectively and not as a single permit. 7244
(4) In addition to the required live racing days, a permit 7245
holder shall simulcast a simulcast racing program on a minimum 7246
of three hundred sixty days each calendar year. The permit 7247
holder shall simulcast all simulcast racing programs conducted 7248
in this state and made available to the permit holder and 7249
simulcast racing programs conducted outside this state. 7250
(5) The commission may make exception to the required 7251
minimum number of live racing days or simulcast racing program 7252
days in instances of natural disaster or other unexpected 7253
circumstances as defined by the commission, in its sole 7254
discretion. For any calendar year, the horsemen's association at 7255
each track may negotiate an agreement with the permit holder for 7256
that track to reduce the number of live racing days at that 7257
track to less than the minimum live racing days required by 7258
division (B)(2)(a)(A)(2)(a), (b), or (c) of this section, as 7259
applicable, subject to the approval of the commission. These 7260
negotiations shall not reduce the number of live racing days to 7261
less than fifty days per calendar year. 7262
(6) To satisfy the requirement of live racing days, a 7263
permit holder may include the number of days on which live 7264
racing programs were conducted under a permit issued under 7265

Section 401:
section 3769.07 of the Revised Code for racing days authorized 7266

(C)(B) The commission shall allocate to each track one 7268
racing day for each permit holder during each calendar year for 7269
the conduct of a live racing program on which a permit holder 7270
may conduct as few as one live horse race, with the remainder of 7271
the horse races on that racing day on which pari-mutuel wagering 7272
is conducted as part of the live racing program being simulcast 7273
from other tracks and facilities located either inside or 7274
outside this state. In addition, the commission may allocate to 7275
each permit holder racing days on which it may as part of a live 7276
racing program simulcast more than two horse races from 7277
facilities located outside this state if the horse races involve 7278
a national wagering pool and pari-mutuel wagering is conducted 7279
on the national wagering pool, but on such a racing day there 7280
shall in no event be more than two horse races simulcast from 7281
facilities located outside this state included in a live racing 7282
program on which separate pari-mutuel wagering is conducted. As 7283
used in this division, "national wagering pool" means an 7284
interstate or intrastate common pari-mutuel wagering pool 7285
involving two or more selections covering two or more horse 7286
races conducted at tracks located inside or outside this state. 7287
In emergency situations, the commission may authorize a 7288
live racing day at a track in which all horse races on that 7289
racing day on which pari-mutuel wagering is conducted are 7290
simulcast from tracks and facilities located either inside or 7291
outside this state with the consent of the thoroughbred 7292
horsemens association for a track conducting a thoroughbred live 7293
racing program and with the consent of the Ohio harness 7294
horsemens association for a track conducting a harness live 7295
racing program. If a horsemen's organization withholds its 7296
consent, the permit holder may file an objection with the 7297

determine whether the horsemen's organization's action in 7299
withholding consent is without substantial merit and, if the 7300
commission so determines, shall authorize the permit holder to 7301
simulcast the simulcast racing programs. The determination of 7302
the commission is final. 7303
(D)(C) On any day that a racing day has been applied for 7304
at any track in this state, each track in this state may operate 7305
as either a simulcast host or a simulcast guest and may conduct, 7306
with the approval of the state racing commission, pari-mutuel 7307
wagering on all simulcasts of races conducted inside this state 7308
made available to it plus all simulcasts of races conducted at 7309
facilities located outside this state as determined by the 7310
simulcast hosts. Except as otherwise provided in this section, 7311
any simulcast host or simulcast guest may receive and conduct 7312
simulcast racing programs that feature any breed of horse at any 7313
time of day, as authorized by the commission. Those persons 7314
holding state fair, county fair, or other fair permits shall not 7315
receive a simulcast racing program on which pari-mutuel wagering 7316
is conducted, except that a holder of a permit issued under 7317

Section 402:
section 3769.07 of the Revised Code that has been authorized by 7318
the commission to conduct races of the state fair, a county 7319
fair, or other fair at a commercial track may receive and 7320
conduct simulcast racing programs as a simulcast host or 7321
simulcast guest at the same time in conjunction with the live 7322
racing program of the state fair, county fair, or other fair 7323

simulcast hosts. In addition, a simulcast host and simulcast 7333
guest, with the approval of the commission, may also receive 7334
simulcast horse races and simulcast racing programs not agreed 7335
to by simulcast hosts. 7336
A simulcast host that normally operates during the day 7337
only may serve as a simulcast host for only day-simulcast racing 7338
programs, which include all simulcast racing programs that 7339
commence at a track located outside this state on or before four 7340

evening, but that under its permit conducts live racing programs 7346
during the day, may serve as a simulcast host for day-simulcast 7347
racing programs. A permit holder that is offering at its track 7348
simulcast racing programs that commence at a track located 7349
outside this state on or before four p.m. and simulcast racing 7350
programs that commence at a track located outside this state on 7351

the horsemen's organization shall not be unreasonably withheld 7446
and shall be consistent with the interest of preserving live 7447
racing in this state. If the horsemen's organization withholds 7448
its consent, the permit holder may file an objection with the 7449
state racing commission, which shall promptly consider the 7450

permit holder for such simulcasts, a permit holder shall retain 7508
for the costs of administration a fee in an amount equal to one 7509
per cent of the amount wagered on the races simulcast by the 7510
permit holder. From the remaining balance of the fee, one-half 7511

interstate or intrastate common wagering pool in a manner agreed 7550
to by the participating tracks and the host track. An interstate 7551

racing week, the collection and settlement agent shall pay and 7653
distribute to each simulcast host operating during that racing 7654
week its pro rata share of the fees collected from simulcast 7655

requirements of this section and sections 3769.089 and 3769.26 7773
of the Revised Code in the manner and to the extent set forth in 7774
the commission's order. In addition, the commission may make an 7775
assessment against the permit holder, satellite facility, or 7776

interest, shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed 7823
in section 5703.47 of the Revised Code and shall have the same 7824

service applicable to the project. In no event, however, shall 8145

(D) In order to qualify for the reduction in tax, a permit 8170
holder shall apply to the racing commission in such form as the 8171
commission may require and shall provide full details of the 8172
major capital improvement project, including plans and 8173
specifications, a schedule for the project's construction and 8174
completion, and a breakdown of proposed costs. In addition, the 8175
permit holder shall have commenced construction of the major 8176
capital improvement project or shall have had the application 8177
for the project approved by the racing commission prior to March 8178
29, 1988. The racing commission shall not approve an application 8179
unless the permit holder shows that a contract for the major 8180
capital improvement project has been let under an unrestricted 8181
competitive bidding procedure, unless the contract is exempted 8182
by the controlling board because of its unusual nature. In 8183
determining whether to approve an application, the racing 8184
commission shall consider whether the major capital improvement 8185
project will promote the safety, convenience, and comfort of the 8186
racing public and horse owners and generally tend toward the 8187
improvement of racing in this state. 8188
(E) If the major capital improvement project is approved 8189
by the racing commission and construction has started, the tax 8190
reduction may be authorized by the commission upon presentation 8191
of copies of paid bills in excess of five hundred thousand 8192
dollars. After the initial authorization, the permit holder 8193
shall present copies of paid bills in the amount of not less 8194
than five hundred thousand dollars. If the permit holder is in 8195
substantial compliance with the schedule for construction and 8196
completion of the major capital improvement project, the racing 8197
commission may authorize the continuance of the tax reduction 8198
upon the presentation of the additional paid bills in increments 8199
of five hundred thousand dollars. The racing commission may 8200

terminate the tax reduction if a permit holder fails to complete 8201
the major capital improvement project or fails to comply 8202
substantially with the schedule for construction and completion 8203
of the major capital improvement project. If the time for 8204
completion of the major capital improvement project is delayed 8205
by acts of God, strikes, or the unavailability of labor or 8206
materials, the time for completion as set forth in the schedule 8207
shall be extended by the period of the delay. If a permit holder 8208
fails to complete the major capital improvement project, the 8209
racing commission shall order the permit holder to repay to the 8210
state the total amount of tax reduced, unless the permit holder 8211
has spent at least six million dollars on the project. The 8212
normal tax paid by the permit holder under section 3769.08 of 8213
the Revised Code shall be increased by one per cent of the total 8214
amount wagered until the total amount of the additional tax 8215
collected equals the total amount of tax reduced. Any action 8216
taken by the racing commission pursuant to this section in 8217
terminating the tax adjustment or requiring repayment of the 8218
amount of tax reduced shall be subject to Chapter 119. of the 8219
Revised Code. 8220

structure. 8233
(G) The cost and expenses to which the tax reduction 8234
granted under this section applies shall be determined by 8235
generally accepted accounting principles and be verified by an 8236
audit of the permit holder's records, upon completion of the 8237
major capital improvement project, either by the racing 8238
commission or by an independent certified public accountant 8239
selected by the permit holder and approved by the commission. 8240

application, the permit holder shall submit evidence of payment 8254
of the cost of the cleanup, repair, or improvement. The 8255
commission shall approve the tax reduction in the amount of the 8256
cost to the permit holder, net of any insurance proceeds, of any 8257
cleanup, repair, or improvement the commission determines was 8258
required as a result of damage caused by the flood. The permit 8259

(D) The intent of the general assembly in enacting this 8337

Section 431:
section pursuant to Amended House Bill No. 639 of the 115th 8338
general assembly was to fulfill a legitimate government 8339
responsibility in a manner that would be more cost efficient and 8340
effective than direct state agency administration by permitting 8341
nonprofit corporations to be formed to establish health and 8342
retirement funds for the benefit of harness and thoroughbred 8343
horsemen, as it was determined that such persons were in need of 8344
such benefits. 8345

uniform minimum standard of honesty and integrity; 8369
(b) Facilitate the growth of the horse racing industry in 8370
each state that is a party to the compact and throughout the 8371
country by simplifying the licensing process for the individuals 8372

the duplicative and costly process of separate licensing by the 8374
applicable agency in each state that is a party to the compact; 8375
(c) Provide for participation in the compact by officials 8376
of the states that are parties to the compact, and permit those 8377

compact, to enter into contracts with governmental agencies and 8379
nongovernmental persons and entities to carry out the purposes 8380

investigation, other federal law enforcement agencies, the royal 8385
Canadian mounted police, law enforcement agencies of other 8386
nations, and state and local law enforcement agencies. 8387
(5) Both of the following apply under the compact: 8388
(a) No state that is party to the compact, including that 8389
state's racing commission or equivalent agency, is liable for 8390
the debts or other financial obligations incurred by the compact 8391

standards governing the issuance, denial, suspension, or 8404
revocation of a license issued under section 3769.03 of the 8405
Revised Code; 8406
(b) Prevent the enforcement of any statute or rule 8407

background investigation. 8504
No track shall knowingly contract with a person as the 8505
owner of the premises where a satellite facility is located, or 8506
knowingly employ a person as the operator or an employee of a 8507

races to be simulcast to all satellite facilities operating in 8550
this state. Except as otherwise provided in this division, each 8551
satellite facility shall receive simulcasts of and conduct pari- 8552

independent fair. 8563
Except as otherwise provided in this division, the 8564
commission shall not approve the establishment of a satellite 8565

more than fifty miles from one or more tracks if all of the 8569
holders of permits issued for those tracks consent in writing to 8570
the establishment of the satellite facility. The commission may 8571
approve the establishment of a satellite facility at a location 8572
within a radius of thirty-five miles of more than one race track 8573
if all holders of permits issued for those tracks consent in 8574
writing to the establishment of the satellite facility and, if 8575
the tracks are located completely within one county and the 8576
proposed satellite facility will be located within that county, 8577

in that county with the largest population, and the appropriate 8579
legislative authority that is required to approve the satellite 8580
facility under division (A)(1) of this section, approve the 8581
establishment of the new satellite facility. The commission may 8582
approve the establishment of a satellite facility at a location 8583

reception of simulcasts and the operation of the satellite 8594
facility. 8595
(E) All money wagered at the simulcast host, and all money 8596
wagered at all satellite facilities on races simulcast from the 8597
simulcast host, shall be included in a common pari-mutuel pool 8598
at the simulcast host. Except as otherwise provided in division 8599
(F)(6) of this section, the payment shall be the same for all 8600
winning tickets whether a wager is placed at a simulcast host or 8601
a satellite facility. Wagers placed at a satellite facility 8602
shall conform in denomination, character, terms, conditions, and 8603
in all other respects to wagers placed at the simulcast host for 8604
the same race. 8605
(F)(1) As used in division (F) of this section, "effective 8606
rate" means the effective gross tax percentage applicable at the 8607
simulcast host, determined in accordance with sections 3769.08 8608

be paid and the amount of commissions to be retained by permit 8613
holders, fifty per cent of the amount wagered at satellite 8614
facilities on a live racing program simulcast from a simulcast 8615
host shall be allocated to the permit holder's live race 8616

simulcast racing programs. The remainder of the amount wagered 8622
at a satellite facility on races simulcast from a simulcast host 8623
shall be allocated to the satellite facility. In computing the 8624
tax due on the amount allocated to the satellite facility, if 8625
there is more than one simulcast host for out-of-state simulcast 8626
racing programs, the effective rate applied by the satellite 8627

that pays the highest effective rate under section 3769.08 of 8629
the Revised Code on such simulcast racing programs. 8630

racing program. The permit holder at the simulcast host shall 8636
pay, in the manner prescribed under section 3769.103 of the 8637
Revised Code, as a tax, the tax specified in sections 3769.08 8638

tax shall be calculated using the effective rate, and the permit 8640
holder may retain as a commission the percentage of the amount 8641
wagered as specified in those sections. From the tax collected, 8642
the tax commissioner shall make distributions to the respective 8643
funds, and in the proper amounts, as required by sections 8644

Section 433:
3769.08 and 3769.087 of the Revised Code, as applicable. 8645

facility shall be paid as a tax each racing day to the tax 8654
commissioner for deposit into the nursing home franchise permit 8655
fee fund. 8656

effective rate, after payment of the tax specified in division 8658
(F)(4)(a) of this section, shall be retained by the satellite 8659
facility to pay for those costs associated with the reception of 8660
the simulcasts. 8661
(5) From the commission retained by a satellite facility 8662
after the deduction of the tax paid at the effective rate under 8663
division (F)(4) of this section, the satellite facility shall 8664
retain an amount equal to two and three-eighths per cent of the 8665
amount wagered that day on simulcast racing programs and the 8666
balance shall be divided as follows: 8667
(a) One-half shall be paid to the owner of the satellite 8668
facility; 8669
(b) One-half shall be paid to the state racing commission 8670
for deposit into the Ohio combined simulcast horse racing purse 8671
fund. 8672
(6) In addition to the commission retained under this 8673

Section 435:
section, a satellite facility shall retain two and one-half per 8674
cent of the amount that would otherwise be paid on each winning 8675
wager unless the retention of this amount would either cause or 8676
add to a minus pool. As used in division (F)(6) of this section, 8677
"minus pool" means a wagering pool in which a winning wager is 8678
paid off at less than one hundred ten per cent of the amount of 8679

shall pay, by check, draft, or money order, or by wire transfer 8684
of funds, out of the money retained on that day to the 8685
collection and settlement agent the required fee to be paid by 8686
the simulcast host to the tracks, racing associations, or state 8687
regulatory agencies located outside this state for simulcasts 8688
into this state computed and based on one-half of the amount 8689
wagered at the satellite facility that day on interstate 8690
simulcast racing programs. 8691
(G) No license, fee, or excise tax, other than as 8692
specified in division (F)(6) of this section, shall be assessed 8693
upon or collected from a satellite facility, the owners of a 8694
satellite facility, or the holders of permits issued for a track 8695
that has established a satellite facility by any county, 8696
township, municipal corporation, district, or other body having 8697
the authority to assess or collect a tax or fee. 8698
(H) In no case shall that portion of the commissions 8699
designated for purses from satellite facilities be less than 8700
that portion of those commissions designated for purses at the 8701
simulcast host. 8702
(I) It is the intention of the general assembly in 8703
enacting this section not to adversely affect the amounts paid 8704
into the Ohio thoroughbred race fund created under section 8705

Section 436:
3769.083 of the Revised Code. Therefore, each track that acts as 8706
a simulcast host under this section shall calculate, on a semi- 8707
annual basis during calendar years 1994, 1995, and 1996, its 8708
average daily contribution to the Ohio thoroughbred race fund 8709

daily contribution to the fund is less than the average daily 8712
contribution from the same track to the fund during the same 8713
six-month period of calendar year 1992, there shall be 8714
contributed to the fund an amount equal to the average daily 8715
shortfall multiplied by the number of days of live racing 8716
conducted during the six-month period in calendar year 1994, 8717
1995, or 1996, as applicable. The amount of such contribution 8718
shall be allocated among the simulcast host, the purse program 8719
at the simulcast host, and the satellite facilities for which 8720
the track served as the simulcast host, on a pro rata basis in 8721
proportion to the amounts contributed by them to the fund during 8722
such six-month period in calendar year 1994, 1995, or 1996, as 8723
applicable. 8724

account for the benefit of the state lottery. The director also 9446
may approve the obtaining of a surety bond to cover part of the 9447

approval of the commission by rule adopted under Chapter 119. of 9451
the Revised Code, that otherwise ensures the lottery's financial 9452

Section 714:
section applies only to the taxable year for which the election 18826

provides otherwise, this election, once made, is binding and 18828
irrevocable for the taxable year for which the election is made. 18829

(4) If a pass-through entity makes the election provided 18833
for under division (D) of this section, the pass-through entity 18834
shall be liable for any additional taxes, interest, interest 18835
penalty, or penalties imposed by this chapter if the tax 18836
commissioner finds that the single return does not reflect the 18837
correct tax due by the pass-through entity investors covered by 18838
that return. Nothing in this division shall be construed to 18839
limit or alter the liability, if any, imposed on pass-through 18840
entity investors for unpaid or underpaid taxes, interest, 18841
interest penalty, or penalties as a result of the pass-through 18842
entity's making the election provided for under division (D) of 18843
this section. For the purposes of division (D) of this section, 18844
"correct tax due" means the tax that would have been paid by the 18845
pass-through entity had the single return been filed in a manner 18846
reflecting the commissioner's findings. Nothing in division (D) 18847
of this section shall be construed to make or hold a pass- 18848

entity investor's income from a source other than the pass- 18850
through entity electing to file the single return. 18851

return for a taxable year, they shall file a joint return under 18853
this section for that taxable year, and their liabilities are 18854
joint and several, but, if the federal income tax liability of 18855
either spouse is determined on a separate federal income tax 18856
return, they shall file separate returns under this section. 18857
If either spouse is not required to file a federal income 18858
tax return and either or both are required to file a return 18859
pursuant to this chapter, they may elect to file separate or 18860
joint returns, and, pursuant to that election, their liabilities 18861

shall take. 18874

together with remittance made payable to the treasurer of state 18879
in the combined amount of the state and all school district 18880
income taxes shown to be due on the form. 18881
Upon good cause shown, the commissioner may extend the 18882
period for filing any notice or return required to be filed 18883
under this section and may adopt rules relating to extensions. 18884
If the extension results in an extension of time for the payment 18885
of any state or school district income tax liability with 18886
respect to which the return is filed, the taxpayer shall pay at 18887
the time the tax liability is paid an amount of interest 18888
computed at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of 18889
the Revised Code on that liability from the time that payment is 18890
due without extension to the time of actual payment. Except as 18891
provided in section 5747.132 of the Revised Code, in addition to 18892
all other interest charges and penalties, all taxes imposed 18893

until the day an assessment is issued under section 5747.13 of 18898
the Revised Code, whichever occurs first. 18899
If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to 18900
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by section 5747.02 of the 18901
Revised Code or any tax imposed under Chapter 5748. of the 18902
Revised Code, the commissioner may require returns and payments 18903
to be made otherwise than as provided in this section. 18904
To the extent that any provision in this division 18905
conflicts with any provision in section 5747.026 of the Revised 18906
Code, the provision in that section prevails. 18907
(H) The amounts withheld pursuant to section 5747.06, 18908

5747.062, 5747.063, 5747.064, 5747.065, or 5747.071 of the 18909
Revised Code shall be allowed to the ultimate recipient of the 18910
income as credits against payment of the appropriate taxes 18911
imposed on the ultimate recipient by section 5747.02 and under 18912
Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code. As used in this division, 18913
"ultimate recipient" means the person who is required to report 18914
income from which amounts are withheld pursuant to section 18915

Section 719:

this section. 18918

return under division (D) of this section and if any investor is 18920
required to file the annual return and make the payment of taxes 18921
required by this chapter on account of the investor's other 18922
income that is not included in a single return filed by a pass- 18923

return, the investor is entitled to a refundable credit equal to 18925
the investor's proportionate share of the tax paid by the pass- 18926
through entity on behalf of the investor. The investor shall 18927
claim the credit for the investor's taxable year in which or 18928
with which ends the taxable year of the pass-through entity. 18929
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow any credit 18930
provided in this chapter to be claimed more than once. For the 18931
purpose of computing any interest, penalty, or interest penalty, 18932
the investor shall be deemed to have paid the refundable credit 18933
provided by this division on the day that the pass-through 18934
entity paid the estimated tax or the tax giving rise to the 18935
credit. 18936
(J) The tax commissioner shall ensure that each return 18937
required to be filed under this section includes a box that the 18938
taxpayer may check to authorize a paid tax preparer who prepared 18939
the return to communicate with the department of taxation about 18940
matters pertaining to the return. The return or instructions 18941
accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box 18942
the taxpayer authorizes the department of taxation to contact 18943
the preparer concerning questions that arise during the 18944
processing of the return and authorizes the preparer only to 18945
provide the department with information that is missing from the 18946
return, to contact the department for information about the 18947
processing of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund 18948
or payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical 18949
errors, offsets, or return preparation that the taxpayer has 18950
received from the department and has shown to the preparer. 18951

an annual return under this section. Nothing in this division 18967
precludes such an owner from filing the annual return under this 18968

Section 721:

Sec. 5747.20. This section applies solely for the purposes 19020

Section 728:
5747.05 of the Revised Code and computing income taxable in this 19022
state under division (D) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code. 19023
All items of nonbusiness income or deduction shall be 19024
allocated in this state as follows: 19025
(A) All items of nonbusiness income or deduction taken 19026
into account in the computation of adjusted gross income for the 19027
taxable year by a resident shall be allocated to this state. 19028
(B) All items of nonbusiness income or deduction taken 19029
into account in the computation of adjusted gross income for the 19030
taxable year by a nonresident shall be allocated to this state 19031
as follows: 19032
(1) All items of compensation paid to an individual for 19033
personal services performed in this state who was a nonresident 19034
at the time of payment and all items of deduction directly 19035
allocated thereto shall be allocated to this state. 19036
(2) All gains or losses from the sale of real property, 19037
tangible personal property, or intangible property shall be 19038
allocated as follows: 19039
(a) Capital gains or losses from the sale or other 19040
S. B. No. 197 Page 655

transfer of real property are allocable to this state if the 19041
property is located physically in this state. 19042
(b) Capital gains or losses from the sale or other 19043
transfer of tangible personal property are allocable to this 19044
state if, at the time of such sale or other transfer, the 19045
property had its physical location in this state. 19046
(c) Capital gains or losses from the sale or other 19047
transfer of intangible personal property are allocable to this 19048
state if the taxpayer's domicile was in this state at the time 19049
of such sale or other transfer. 19050
(3) All rents and royalties of real or tangible personal 19051
property shall be allocated to this state as follows: 19052
(a) Rents and royalties derived from real property are 19053
allocable to this state if the property is physically located in 19054
this state. 19055
(b) Rents and royalties derived from tangible personal 19056
property are allocable to this state to the extent that such 19057
property is utilized in this state. 19058
The extent of utilization of tangible personal property in 19059
a state is determined by multiplying the rents or royalties 19060
derived from such property by a fraction, the numerator of which 19061
is the number of days of physical location of the property in 19062
this state during the rental or royalty period in the taxable 19063
year and the denominator of which is the number of days of 19064
physical location of the property everywhere during all rental 19065
or royalty periods in the taxable year. If the physical location 19066
of the property during the rental or royalty period is unknown 19067
or unascertainable by the nonresident, tangible personal 19068
property is utilized in the state in which the property was 19069

possession. 19071
(4) All patent and copyright royalties shall be allocated 19072

employed in production, fabrication, manufacturing, or other 19076
processing in the state, or to the extent that a patented 19077
product is produced in the state. If the basis of receipts from 19078
patent royalties does not permit allocation to states or if the 19079
accounting procedures do not reflect states of utilization, the 19080
patent is utilized in this state if the taxpayer's domicile was 19081
in this state at the time such royalties were paid or accrued. 19082
A copyright is utilized in a state to the extent that 19083
printing or other publication originates in the state. If the 19084
basis of receipts from copyright royalties does not permit 19085
allocation to states or if the accounting procedures do not 19086
reflect states of utilization, the copyright is utilized in this 19087
state if the taxpayer's domicile was in this state at the time 19088
such royalties were paid or accrued. 19089

appellant will result from the execution of the agency's order 800
pending determination of the appeal, the court may grant a 801
suspension and fix its terms. If an appeal is taken from the 802

grant a suspension and fix its terms if it appears to the court 812
that an unusual hardship to the appellant will result from the 813
execution of the agency's order pending determination of the 814
appeal and the health, safety, and welfare of the public will 815
not be threatened by suspension of the order. This provision 816
shall not be construed to limit the factors the court may 817
consider in determining whether to suspend an order of any other 818
agency pending determination of an appeal. 819

sections 119.01 to 119.13 of the Revised Code, the agency shall 874
prepare and certify to the court a complete record of the 875
proceedings in the case. Failure of the agency to comply within 876
the time allowed, upon motion, shall cause the court to enter a 877
finding in favor of the party adversely affected. Additional 878
time, however, may be granted by the court, not to exceed thirty 879
days, when it is shown that the agency has made substantial 880
effort to comply. The record shall be prepared and transcribed, 881
and the expense of it shall be taxed as a part of the costs on 882
the appeal. The appellant shall provide security for costs 883
satisfactory to the court of common pleas. Upon demand by any 884
interested party, the agency shall furnish at the cost of the 885
party requesting it a copy of the stenographic report of 886
testimony offered and evidence submitted at any hearing and a 887
copy of the complete record. 888

in accordance with this chapter. In addition, the board is not 894
required to prepare or transcribe the record of any of its 895

(L) Unless otherwise provided by law, in the hearing of 901

when satisfied that the additional evidence is newly discovered 905
and could not with reasonable diligence have been ascertained 906
prior to the hearing before the agency. 907

over all other actions. The hearing in the court of common pleas 920
shall proceed as in the trial of a civil action, and the court 921
shall determine the rights of the parties in accordance with the 922
laws applicable to a civil action. At the hearing, counsel may 923
be heard on oral argument, briefs may be submitted, and evidence 924
may be introduced if the court has granted a request for the 925
presentation of additional evidence. 926

absence of this finding, it may reverse, vacate, or modify the 932

the extent not in conflict with those rules, Chapter 2505. of 944

questions of law relating to the constitutionality, 946
construction, or interpretation of statutes and rules of the 947
agency, and, in the appeal, the court may also review and 948
determine the correctness of the judgment of the court of common 949
pleas that the order of the agency is not supported by any 950
reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in the entire 951

time to conduct the investigation if the attorney general 3708
commission has cause to believe that additional time is 3709
necessary to complete the investigation and has notified the 3710
applicant in writing about the specific concerns raised during 3711
the investigation. 3712

harness racing shall pay to the harness horsemen's purse pool a 6250
sum equal to fifty per cent of the pari-mutuel revenues retained 6251

(J)(1) To encourage the improvement of racing facilities 6309
for the benefit of the public, breeders, and horse owners, and 6310
to increase the revenue to the state from the increase in pari- 6311
mutuel wagering resulting from those improvements, the taxes 6312
paid by a permit holder to the state as provided for in this 6313
chapter shall be reduced by three-fourths of one per cent of the 6314
total amount wagered for those permit holders who make capital 6315
improvements to existing race tracks or construct new race 6316
tracks. The percentage of the reduction that may be taken each 6317
racing day shall equal seventy-five per cent of the taxes levied 6318
under divisions (B) and (C) of this section and section 3769.087 6319
of the Revised Code, and division (F)(2) of section 3769.26 of 6320
the Revised Code, as applicable, divided by the calculated 6321

this section and section 3769.087 of the Revised Code, and 6323
division (F)(2) of section 3769.26 of the Revised Code and the 6324
reduction provided for in this division. If the resulting 6325
percentage is less than one, that percentage shall be multiplied 6326

Otherwise, the permit holder shall receive the full reduction 6328
provided for in this division. The amount of the allowable 6329
reduction not received shall be carried forward and applied 6330
against future tax liability. After any reductions expire, any 6331
reduction carried forward shall be treated as a reduction as 6332
provided for in this division. 6333

If more than one permit holder is authorized to conduct 6334
racing at the facility that is being built or improved, the cost 6335
of the new race track or capital improvement shall be allocated 6336
between or among all the permit holders in the ratio that the 6337
permit holders' number of racing days bears to the total number 6338
of racing days conducted at the facility. 6339
A reduction for a new race track or a capital improvement 6340
shall start from the day racing is first conducted following the 6341
date actual construction of the new race track or each capital 6342
improvement is completed and the construction cost has been 6343
approved by the racing commission, unless otherwise provided in 6344
this section. A reduction for a new race track or a capital 6345
improvement shall continue for a period of twenty-five years for 6346
new race tracks and for fifteen years for capital improvements 6347
if the construction of the capital improvement or new race track 6348
commenced prior to March 29, 1988, and for a period of ten years 6349
for new race tracks or capital improvements if the construction 6350
of the capital improvement or new race track commenced on or 6351
after March 29, 1988, but before June 6, 2001, or until the 6352
total tax reduction reaches seventy per cent of the approved 6353
cost of the new race track or capital improvement, as allocated 6354
to each permit holder, whichever occurs first. A reduction for a 6355
new race track or a capital improvement approved after June 6, 6356
2001, shall continue until the total tax reduction reaches one 6357
hundred per cent of the approved cost of the new race track or 6358
capital improvement, as allocated to each permit holder. 6359
A reduction granted for a new race track or a capital 6360
improvement, the application for which was approved by the 6361
racing commission after March 29, 1988, but before June 6, 2001, 6362
shall not commence nor shall the ten-year period begin to run 6363
until all prior tax reductions with respect to the same race 6364

track have ended. The total tax reduction because of capital 6365
improvements shall not during any one year exceed for all permit 6366
holders using any one track three-fourths of one per cent of the 6367
total amount wagered, regardless of the number of capital 6368
improvements made. Several capital improvements to a race track 6369
may be consolidated in an application if the racing commission 6370
approved the application prior to March 29, 1988. No permit 6371
holder may receive a tax reduction for a capital improvement 6372
approved by the racing commission on or after March 29, 1988, at 6373
a race track until all tax reductions have ended for all prior 6374
capital improvements approved by the racing commission under 6375
this section or section 3769.20 of the Revised Code at that race 6376
track. If there are two or more permit holders operating 6377
meetings at the same track, they may consolidate their 6378
applications. The racing commission shall notify the tax 6379
commissioner when the reduction of tax begins and when it ends. 6380
Each fiscal year the racing commission shall submit a 6381
report to the tax commissioner, the office of budget and 6382
management, and the legislative service commission. The report 6383
shall identify each capital improvement project undertaken under 6384
this division and in progress at each race track, indicate the 6385
total cost of each project, state the tax reduction that 6386
resulted from each project during the immediately preceding 6387
fiscal year, estimate the tax reduction that will result from 6388
each project during the current fiscal year, state the total tax 6389
reduction that resulted from all such projects at all race 6390
tracks during the immediately preceding fiscal year, and 6391
estimate the total tax reduction that will result from all such 6392
projects at all race tracks during the current fiscal year. 6393
(2) In order to qualify for the reduction in tax, a permit 6394
holder shall apply to the racing commission in such form as the 6395

commission may require and shall provide full details of the new 6396
race track or capital improvement, including a schedule for its 6397
construction and completion, and set forth the costs and 6398
expenses incurred in connection with it. The racing commission 6399
shall not approve an application unless the permit holder shows 6400
that a contract for the new race track or capital improvement 6401
has been let under an unrestricted competitive bidding 6402
procedure, unless the contract is exempted by the controlling 6403
board because of its unusual nature. In determining whether to 6404
approve an application, the racing commission shall consider 6405
whether the new race track or capital improvement will promote 6406
the safety, convenience, and comfort of the racing public and 6407
horse owners and generally tend towards the improvement of 6408
racing in this state. 6409
(3) If a new race track or capital improvement is approved 6410
by the racing commission and construction has started, the tax 6411
reduction may be authorized by the commission upon presentation 6412
of copies of paid bills in excess of one hundred thousand 6413
dollars or ten per cent of the approved cost, whichever is 6414
greater. After the initial authorization, the permit holder 6415
shall present copies of paid bills. If the permit holder is in 6416
substantial compliance with the schedule for construction and 6417
completion of the new race track or capital improvement, the 6418
racing commission may authorize the continuation of the tax 6419
reduction upon the presentation of the additional paid bills. 6420
The total amount of the tax reduction authorized shall not 6421
exceed the percentage of the approved cost of the new race track 6422
or capital improvement specified in division (J)(1) of this 6423
section. The racing commission may terminate any tax reduction 6424
immediately if a permit holder fails to complete the new race 6425
track or capital improvement, or to substantially comply with 6426

S. B. No. 197 Page 221
As Introduced
the schedule for construction and completion of the new race 6427
track or capital improvement. If a permit holder fails to 6428
complete a new race track or capital improvement, the racing 6429
commission shall order the permit holder to repay to the state 6430
the total amount of tax reduced. The normal tax paid by the 6431
permit holder shall be increased by three-fourths of one per 6432
cent of the total amount wagered until the total amount of the 6433
additional tax collected equals the total amount of tax reduced. 6434
(4) As used in this section: 6435
(a) "Capital improvement" means an addition, replacement, 6436
or remodeling of a structural unit of a race track facility 6437
costing at least one hundred thousand dollars, including, but 6438
not limited to, the construction of barns used exclusively for 6439
the race track facility, backstretch facilities for horsemen, 6440
paddock facilities, new pari-mutuel and totalizator equipment 6441
and appurtenances to that equipment purchased by the track, new 6442
access roads, new parking areas, the complete reconstruction, 6443
reshaping, and leveling of the racing surface and appurtenances, 6444
the installation of permanent new heating or air conditioning, 6445
roof replacement or restoration, installations of a permanent 6446
nature forming a part of the track structure, and construction 6447
of buildings that are located on a permit holder's premises. 6448
"Capital improvement" does not include the cost of replacement 6449
of equipment that is not permanently installed, ordinary 6450
repairs, painting, and maintenance required to keep a race track 6451
facility in ordinary operating condition. 6452
(b) "New race track" includes the reconstruction of a race 6453
track damaged by fire or other cause that has been declared by 6454
the racing commission, as a result of the damage, to be an 6455
inadequate facility for the safe operation of horse racing. 6456

S. B. No. 197 Page 222
As Introduced
(c) "Approved cost" includes all debt service and interest 6457
costs that are associated with a capital improvement or new race 6458
track and that the racing commission approves for a tax 6459
reduction under division (J) of this section. 6460
(5) The racing commission shall not approve an application 6461
for a tax reduction under this section if it has reasonable 6462
cause to believe that the actions or negligence of the permit 6463
holder substantially contributed to the damage suffered by the 6464
track due to fire or other cause. The racing commission shall 6465
obtain any data or information available from a fire marshal, 6466
law enforcement official, or insurance company concerning any 6467
fire or other damage suffered by a track, prior to approving an 6468
application for a tax reduction. 6469
(6) The approved cost to which a tax reduction applies 6470
shall be determined by generally accepted accounting principles 6471
and verified by an audit of the permit holder's records upon 6472
completion of the project by the racing commission, or by an 6473
independent certified public accountant selected by the permit 6474
holder and approved by the commission. 6475
(K) No other license or excise tax or fee, except as 6476
provided in sections 3769.01 to 3769.14 of the Revised Code, 6477
shall be assessed or collected from such licensee by any county, 6478
township, district, municipal corporation, or other body having 6479
power to assess or collect a tax or fee. That portion of the tax 6480
paid under this section by permit holders for racing conducted 6481
at and during the course of an agricultural exposition or fair, 6482
and that portion of the tax that would have been paid by 6483
eligible permit holders into the nursing home franchise permit 6484
fee fund as a result of racing conducted at and during the 6485
course of an agricultural exposition or fair, shall be deposited 6486

As Introduced
into the state treasury to the credit of the horse racing tax 6487
fund, which is hereby created for the use of the agricultural 6488
societies of the several counties in which the taxes originate. 6489
The state racing commission shall determine eligible permit 6490
holders for purposes of the preceding sentence, taking into 6491
account the breed of horse, the racing dates, the geographic 6492
proximity to the fair, and the best interests of Ohio racing. On 6493
the first day of any month on which there is money in the fund, 6494
the tax commissioner shall provide for payment to the treasurer 6495
of each agricultural society the amount of the taxes collected 6496
under this section upon racing conducted at and during the 6497
course of any exposition or fair conducted by the society. 6498
(L) From the tax paid under this section by harness track 6499
permit holders, the tax commissioner shall pay into the Ohio 6500
thoroughbred race fund a sum equal to a percentage of the amount 6501
wagered upon which the tax is paid. The percentage shall be 6502
determined by the tax commissioner and shall be rounded to the 6503
nearest one-hundredth. The percentage shall be such that, when 6504
multiplied by the amount wagered upon which tax was paid by the 6505
harness track permit holders in the most recent year for which 6506
final figures are available, it results in a sum that 6507
substantially equals the same amount of tax paid by the tax 6508
commissioner during that year into the Ohio fairs fund from 6509
taxes paid by thoroughbred permit holders. This division does 6510
not apply to county and independent fairs and agricultural 6511
societies. 6512
(M) Twenty-five per cent of the taxes levied on 6513
thoroughbred racing permit holders, harness racing permit 6514
holders, and quarter horse racing permit holders under this 6515

the Ohio standardbred development commission, after a hearing 6940
and not later than the twentieth day of January, shall allocate 6941
and approve all available moneys for colt races for two-year-old 6942
and three-year-old colts and fillies, both trotting and pacing. 6943
Separate races for fillies shall be provided at each age and 6944
gait. Up to five races and a championship race shall be 6945
scheduled for each of the eight categories of age, sex, and 6946
gait. The allocations shall take into account the time of year 6947
that racing colts is feasible, the equity and continuity of the 6948
proposed dates for racing events, and the amounts to be added by 6949
the tracks, looking to the maximum benefit for those 6950
participating in the races. Representatives of the tracks and 6951
the Ohio harness horsemen's association shall be given an 6952
opportunity to be heard before the allocations are made. No 6953
races shall be contested earlier than the first day of May or 6954
later than the first day of November; all permit holders 6955
operating extended pari-mutuel meetings between those dates 6956
shall be entitled to at least three races. No funds for a race 6957
shall be allocated to and paid to a permit holder by the 6958
development commission unless the permit holder adds at least 6959
twenty-five per cent to the amount allocated by the development 6960
commission, and not less than five thousand dollars to each 6961
race. 6962
Colts and fillies eligible to the races shall be only 6963
those sired by a standardbred stallion that was registered with 6964
the state racing commission and stood in the state the entire 6965
breeding season of the year the colt or filly was conceived. 6966

If the development commission concludes that sufficient 6967
funds are available to add aged races without reducing purse 6968
levels of the colt and filly races, the development commission 6969
may allocate funds to four-year-old and up races of each sex and 6970
gait with Ohio eligibility required as set forth in this 6971
section. 6972

agent's commission as determined by the state lottery commission 7039
for conducting video lottery terminal gaming on behalf of the 7040
state be paid to the state racing commission for the benefit of 7041

than two horse races on which pari-mutuel wagering is conducted 7088
are simulcast from facilities located outside this state. If 7089
only one racing meeting of a particular breed of horse is being 7090
held, no fewer than nine live horse races shall be held on a 7091
live racing day. If, during the course of a racing meeting at a 7092
standardbred track, the racing secretary of the permit holder 7093
determines that there is an insufficient number of entries to 7094
have a full field of eight horses for each of nine races on a 7095
live racing program, then the racing secretary of the permit 7096
holder, after consultation with the Ohio harness horsemens 7097
association, may reduce the number of live races on that live 7098
racing program, as the racing secretary may determine. The 7099

association, may reduce the number of live races on that live 7107
racing program, as the racing secretary may determine. The 7108
racing secretary shall not reduce the live racing program to 7109
less than seven live races. No more than seventeen races on 7110
which pari-mutuel wagering is conducted, including both live 7111
races and races simulcast from other facilities located either 7112
inside or outside this state, shall be part of a live racing 7113

satellite facilities in this state; 7120
(b) Receiving a simulcast racing program for simulcasting 7121
to one or more simulcast guests and satellite facilities in this 7122

inside or outside this state that are included in a simulcast 7131
host's live racing program. 7132
(7) "Satellite facility" has the same meaning as in 7133
section 3769.25 of the Revised Code. 7134
(8) "Collection and settlement agent" has the same meaning 7135
as in section 3769.0810 of the Revised Code. 7136
(9) "Special racing event" means individual races in live 7137
racing programs or simulcast racing programs, and simulcast 7138
racing programs on special event days under division (C) of this 7139
section, conducted at facilities located outside this state for 7140
which the track, racing association, or state regulatory agency 7141
conducting such races charges a simulcast host a fee for the 7142
privilege of receiving a simulcast of such races into this state 7143
that is higher than the customary and regular fee charged for 7144
simulcast races because of the status or popularity of such 7145

races. 7146
(B)(1)(a) (A)(1)(a) The state racing commission shall, 7147
upon request by any permit holder, permit electronically 7148
televised simulcasts of horse races at the permit holder's track 7149
or enclosure on racing days authorized by the permit holder's 7150
permit. Except as provided in division (B)(A) of this section, 7151
the commission shall not permit the simulcast of any simulcast 7152
racing program conducted at tracks or facilities located outside 7153
this state unless the out-of-state simulcast racing program is 7154
available at the same signal rate to all permit holders, whether 7155
serving as simulcast hosts or simulcast guests, and all 7156
satellite facilities, in this state open and operating on that 7157
day. A permit holder or satellite facility may inform the 7158
commission that it waives the right to receive the simulcast of 7159
a simulcast racing program or a race in a simulcast racing 7160
program on that day and in this event the simulcast racing 7161
program or simulcast race shall be available to all other 7162
simulcast hosts, simulcast guests, and satellite facilities open 7163
and operating in this state on that day. 7164
(b) In order for a permit holder to offer simulcasts of 7165
horse races conducted at facilities located outside this state, 7166
the permit holder shall have conducted live racing programs 7167
during the immediately preceding calendar year on a number of 7168
days that is not less than the number of regular live racing 7169
days it conducted in calendar year 1991, not including 7170
additional racing days conducted in calendar year 1991 by the 7171
permit holder at a winterized facility under a permit issued 7172
under section 3769.07 of the Revised Code, as certified by the 7173
commission. In satisfying the foregoing requirement for live 7174
racing days during the immediately preceding calendar year, a 7175
permit holder may include the number of days on which live 7176

S. B. No. 197 Page 246
As Introduced
racing programs were conducted under a permit issued under 7177
section 3769.07 of the Revised Code for additional racing days 7178
at a winterized facility. In addition, in order for a permit 7179
holder to offer simulcasts of horse races conducted at 7180
facilities located outside this state, the permit holder shall 7181
offer all simulcasts of horse races conducted in this state made 7182
available to it. 7183
In order for a permit holder to offer simulcasts of races 7184
conducted at race tracks located outside this state at the same 7185
time and during the hours in which the live races of a live 7186
racing program are being conducted at its track, a permit holder 7187
conducting a thoroughbred live racing program shall obtain the 7188
consent of the thoroughbred horsemens association and a permit 7189
holder conducting a harness live racing program shall obtain the 7190
consent of the Ohio harness horsemens association. The consent 7191
of the horsemen's organization shall not be unreasonably 7192
withheld, and shall be consistent with the interest of 7193
preserving live racing in this state. If a horsemen's 7194
organization withholds its consent, the permit holder may file 7195
an objection with the commission, which shall promptly consider 7196
the objection and determine whether the horsemen's 7197
organization's action in withholding consent is without 7198
substantial merit and, if the commission so determines, shall 7199
authorize the permit holder to simulcast the simulcast racing 7200
programs. The determination of the commission is final. A permit 7201
holder, as a simulcast host, may offer simulcast racing programs 7202
at its track or enclosure of races conducted at tracks and 7203
facilities located outside this state prior to the commencement 7204
of, and following the conclusion of, its live races without 7205
obtaining the consent of a horsemen's organization under this 7206
division. 7207

As Introduced
(c) Division (B)(1)(b) (A)(1)(b) of this section remains 7208
in effect for each permit holder until the calendar year after 7209
that permit holder first receives a commission as a lottery 7210
sales agent for conducting video lottery terminal gaming on 7211
behalf of the state. 7212
(2) Notwithstanding section 3769.07 of the Revised Code 7213
and unless otherwise agreed to by the applicable horsemen's 7214
association and the permit holder, beginning in the calendar 7215
year after the permit holder first receives video lottery 7216
terminal income, one of the following applies as determined on a 7217
yearly basis: 7218
(a) If eleven per cent of the gross gaming revenue from 7219
video lottery terminals at the permit holder's facilities 7220
(either existing or relocated) in the previous calendar year 7221
exceeds fifteen million dollars, a permit holder shall conduct a 7222
minimum of one hundred twenty-five live racing days. 7223
(b) If eleven per cent of the gross gaming revenue from 7224
video lottery terminals at the permit holder's facilities 7225
(either existing or relocated) in the previous calendar year 7226
exceeds eleven million dollars, but is less than or equal to 7227
fifteen million dollars, a permit holder shall conduct a minimum 7228
of one hundred live racing days or the number of racing days 7229
applied for by the permit holder in calendar year 2012, 7230
whichever is greater. 7231
(c) If eleven per cent of the gross gaming revenue from 7232
video lottery terminals at the permit holder's facilities 7233
(either existing or relocated) in the previous calendar year is 7234
less than or equal to eleven million dollars, a permit holder 7235
shall conduct a minimum of seventy-five racing days or the 7236
number of racing days applied for by the permit holder for 7237

S. B. No. 197 Page 248
As Introduced
calendar year 2012, whichever is greater. 7238
In no case shall the minimum number of racing days for any 7239
permit holder exceed one hundred twenty-five racing days. 7240
(3) For the purposes of division (B)(2)(A)(2) of this 7241
section, for live racing conducted at a track with more than one 7242
permit, the minimum live racing days shall apply to those 7243
permits collectively and not as a single permit. 7244
(4) In addition to the required live racing days, a permit 7245
holder shall simulcast a simulcast racing program on a minimum 7246
of three hundred sixty days each calendar year. The permit 7247
holder shall simulcast all simulcast racing programs conducted 7248
in this state and made available to the permit holder and 7249
simulcast racing programs conducted outside this state. 7250
(5) The commission may make exception to the required 7251
minimum number of live racing days or simulcast racing program 7252
days in instances of natural disaster or other unexpected 7253
circumstances as defined by the commission, in its sole 7254
discretion. For any calendar year, the horsemen's association at 7255
each track may negotiate an agreement with the permit holder for 7256
that track to reduce the number of live racing days at that 7257
track to less than the minimum live racing days required by 7258
division (B)(2)(a)(A)(2)(a), (b), or (c) of this section, as 7259
applicable, subject to the approval of the commission. These 7260
negotiations shall not reduce the number of live racing days to 7261
less than fifty days per calendar year. 7262
(6) To satisfy the requirement of live racing days, a 7263
permit holder may include the number of days on which live 7264
racing programs were conducted under a permit issued under 7265
section 3769.07 of the Revised Code for racing days authorized 7266

at a winterized facility. 7267
(C)(B) The commission shall allocate to each track one 7268
racing day for each permit holder during each calendar year for 7269
the conduct of a live racing program on which a permit holder 7270
may conduct as few as one live horse race, with the remainder of 7271
the horse races on that racing day on which pari-mutuel wagering 7272
is conducted as part of the live racing program being simulcast 7273
from other tracks and facilities located either inside or 7274
outside this state. In addition, the commission may allocate to 7275
each permit holder racing days on which it may as part of a live 7276
racing program simulcast more than two horse races from 7277
facilities located outside this state if the horse races involve 7278
a national wagering pool and pari-mutuel wagering is conducted 7279
on the national wagering pool, but on such a racing day there 7280
shall in no event be more than two horse races simulcast from 7281
facilities located outside this state included in a live racing 7282
program on which separate pari-mutuel wagering is conducted. As 7283
used in this division, "national wagering pool" means an 7284
interstate or intrastate common pari-mutuel wagering pool 7285
involving two or more selections covering two or more horse 7286
races conducted at tracks located inside or outside this state. 7287
In emergency situations, the commission may authorize a 7288
live racing day at a track in which all horse races on that 7289
racing day on which pari-mutuel wagering is conducted are 7290
simulcast from tracks and facilities located either inside or 7291
outside this state with the consent of the thoroughbred 7292
horsemens association for a track conducting a thoroughbred live 7293
racing program and with the consent of the Ohio harness 7294
horsemens association for a track conducting a harness live 7295
racing program. If a horsemen's organization withholds its 7296
consent, the permit holder may file an objection with the 7297

commission, which shall promptly consider the objection and 7298
determine whether the horsemen's organization's action in 7299
withholding consent is without substantial merit and, if the 7300
commission so determines, shall authorize the permit holder to 7301
simulcast the simulcast racing programs. The determination of 7302
the commission is final. 7303
(D)(C) On any day that a racing day has been applied for 7304
at any track in this state, each track in this state may operate 7305
as either a simulcast host or a simulcast guest and may conduct, 7306
with the approval of the state racing commission, pari-mutuel 7307
wagering on all simulcasts of races conducted inside this state 7308
made available to it plus all simulcasts of races conducted at 7309
facilities located outside this state as determined by the 7310
simulcast hosts. Except as otherwise provided in this section, 7311
any simulcast host or simulcast guest may receive and conduct 7312
simulcast racing programs that feature any breed of horse at any 7313
time of day, as authorized by the commission. Those persons 7314
holding state fair, county fair, or other fair permits shall not 7315
receive a simulcast racing program on which pari-mutuel wagering 7316
is conducted, except that a holder of a permit issued under 7317
section 3769.07 of the Revised Code that has been authorized by 7318
the commission to conduct races of the state fair, a county 7319
fair, or other fair at a commercial track may receive and 7320
conduct simulcast racing programs as a simulcast host or 7321
simulcast guest at the same time in conjunction with the live 7322
racing program of the state fair, county fair, or other fair 7323
permit holder conducted at its track. 7324
The simulcast hosts, with the approval of the state racing 7325
commission, shall determine which simulcast racing programs 7326
offered by race tracks located outside this state will be 7327
simulcast at their tracks and at all simulcast hosts, simulcast 7328

receive all approved simulcast racing programs offered by 7332
simulcast hosts. In addition, a simulcast host and simulcast 7333
guest, with the approval of the commission, may also receive 7334
simulcast horse races and simulcast racing programs not agreed 7335
to by simulcast hosts. 7336
A simulcast host that normally operates during the day 7337
only may serve as a simulcast host for only day-simulcast racing 7338
programs, which include all simulcast racing programs that 7339
commence at a track located outside this state on or before four 7340
p.m. A simulcast host that normally operates during the evening 7341
only may serve as a simulcast host for only evening-simulcast 7342
racing programs, which include all simulcast racing programs 7343
that commence at a track located outside this state on or after 7344
three p.m. A simulcast host that normally operates during the 7345
evening, but that under its permit conducts live racing programs 7346
during the day, may serve as a simulcast host for day-simulcast 7347
racing programs. A permit holder that is offering at its track 7348
simulcast racing programs that commence at a track located 7349
outside this state on or before four p.m. and simulcast racing 7350
programs that commence at a track located outside this state on 7351
or after three p.m. may serve as a simulcast host for both the 7352
day-simulcast racing program and the evening-simulcast racing 7353
program only if no other permit holder is serving as a simulcast 7354

simulcast guests in this state shall receive from each simulcast 7361
host and each simulcast guest receiving the simulcast an 7362
intrastate simulcast fee of one and three-eighths per cent of 7363
the amounts wagered on such simulcast racing program at its 7364
facilities. The simulcast hosts and simulcast guests receiving 7365
such simulcast racing program shall pay the intrastate simulcast 7366
fee to the collection and settlement agent, and the fee shall be 7367
disbursed by the agent, at the time and in the manner provided 7368
in section 3769.0810 of the Revised Code. 7369
(E)(1)(D)(1) The moneys wagered on simulcast racing 7370
programs on a racing day shall be separated from the moneys 7371
wagered on the live racing program on that racing day. From the 7372
moneys wagered on the simulcast races, each permit holder may 7373
retain as a commission the percentage of the amount wagered as 7374
specified in sections 3769.08 and 3769.087 of the Revised Code, 7375
as applicable, and shall pay, in the manner prescribed under 7376
section 3769.103 of the Revised Code, as a tax, the tax 7377
specified in sections 3769.08 and 3769.087 of the Revised Code, 7378
as applicable. From the tax collected, the tax commissioner 7379
shall make the distributions to the respective funds, and in the 7380
proper amounts, as required by sections 3769.08 and 3769.087 of 7381

(E)(2)(D)(2) of this section, from the amount remaining after 7383
the payment of state taxes on the moneys wagered on live racing 7384
programs and on the moneys wagered on simulcast racing programs, 7385
a permit holder shall retain an amount equal to two and three- 7386
eighths per cent of the amount wagered on live racing programs 7387
and on intrastate and interstate simulcast racing programs 7388

reception and transmission of simulcasts and the administrative 7393
cost of the conduct of live racing programs and simulcast racing 7394
programs. From the remaining balance, one-half shall be retained 7395
by the permit holder for purses. On a day when a permit holder 7396
conducts a live racing program, all purse money generated from 7397
wagering on live racing programs and on simulcast racing 7398
programs at its track shall be used for that permit holder's 7399
purse account. On a day when a permit holder operates as a 7400
simulcast host with no live racing program, or operates as a 7401
simulcast guest, all purse money generated from wagering on 7402
intrastate and interstate simulcast racing programs shall be 7403
paid to the state racing commission for deposit into the Ohio 7404
combined simulcast horse racing purse fund created under this 7405
section. In addition, on a day when a permit holder serves as a 7406
simulcast host for a satellite facility, all purse money 7407
generated from amounts wagered at the satellite facility 7408
allocated to the permit holder under section 3769.26 of the 7409
Revised Code shall be paid to the commission for deposit into 7410
the Ohio simulcast horse racing purse fund. 7411

in any such event the amount to be retained as a fee by the 7418
permit holder under division (E)(1)(D)(1) of this section shall 7419
be one and seven-eighths per cent until such time as the number 7420
of satellite facilities specified in division (E)(2)(D)(2) of 7421

racing event and other simulcast hosts, simulcast guests, and 7432
satellite facilities receiving the special racing event shall 7433
not retain the fee provided under division (E)(1)(D)(1) or (2) 7434

special racing event an amount equal to the fee charged by the 7436
track, racing association, or state regulatory agency 7437
simulcasting the special racing event to the simulcast host. 7438
From the remaining balance, one-half shall be retained by the 7439
permit holder for purses in the manner provided in division (E) 7440
(1)(D)(1) of this section. 7441
A permit holder proposing to simulcast a special racing 7442
event as a simulcast host shall advise its horsemen's 7443
organization of the proposed schedule of the special racing 7444
event and obtain its consent to this schedule. The consent of 7445
the horsemen's organization shall not be unreasonably withheld 7446
and shall be consistent with the interest of preserving live 7447
racing in this state. If the horsemen's organization withholds 7448
its consent, the permit holder may file an objection with the 7449
state racing commission, which shall promptly consider the 7450
objection and determine whether the organization's action in 7451
withholding consent is without substantial merit and, if the 7452

commission so determines, shall authorize the permit holder to 7453
simulcast the special racing event. The determination of the 7454

be used by the commission for the costs of administering this 7462
division and the balance shall be distributed among permit 7463
holders no less frequently than monthly to each permit holder's 7464
purse account on order of the commission. 7465

receive a share of each distribution of the Ohio combined 7467
simulcast horse racing purse fund in the same percentage, 7468
rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of the amount of each 7469
distribution, as the average total amount wagered at the track 7470
on racing days at which live racing programs were conducted, 7471
including the amount allocated to the track under section 7472
3769.26 of the Revised Code for live races, during the five 7473
calendar years immediately preceding the year for which the 7474
distribution is made bears to the average annual total amount 7475
wagered at all tracks in the state operating under permits 7476
issued by the state racing commission under section 3769.07, 7477

distributed to the purse account of each permit holder for each 7490
race meeting. 7491
The commission shall cause to be kept accurate records of 7492
its administration of the fund, including all administrative 7493
expenses incurred by it and charged to the fund, and of 7494
distributions to permit holders. These records are public 7495
records available for inspection at any time during the regular 7496
business hours of the commission by any permit holder or 7497
horsemen's organization, by an authorized agent of the permit 7498
holder or horsemen's organization, or by any other person. 7499
(G)(F) Upon the approval of the commission, a permit 7500
holder conducting live racing programs may transmit 7501
electronically televised simulcasts of horse races conducted at 7502
the permit holder's track to racing associations, tracks, and 7503
facilities located outside this state for the conduct of pari- 7504
mutuel wagering thereon, at the times, on the terms, and for the 7505
fee agreed upon by the permit holder and the receiving racing 7506
association, track, or facility. From the fees paid to the 7507
permit holder for such simulcasts, a permit holder shall retain 7508
for the costs of administration a fee in an amount equal to one 7509
per cent of the amount wagered on the races simulcast by the 7510
permit holder. From the remaining balance of the fee, one-half 7511

tracks either inside or outside this state to conduct, 7532
supervise, and participate in interstate and intrastate common 7533
pari-mutuel wagering pools on those races in the manner provided 7534

in accordance with the rules that govern the host track and 7548
shall be distributed among the tracks participating in the 7549
interstate or intrastate common wagering pool in a manner agreed 7550
to by the participating tracks and the host track. An interstate 7551
common pari-mutuel wagering pool formed under division (H)(3)(G) 7552

(2) Within five business days after the close of each 7652
racing week, the collection and settlement agent shall pay and 7653
distribute to each simulcast host operating during that racing 7654
week its pro rata share of the fees collected from simulcast 7655

issue an emergency order prohibiting the permit holder, 7767
satellite facility, or agent, as the case may be, from serving 7768
as a simulcast host or simulcast guest or from receiving any 7769
simulcast racing program, and conducting wagering thereon, at 7770
its track or satellite facility, until such time as the permit 7771
holder, satellite facility, or agent complies with the 7772
requirements of this section and sections 3769.089 and 3769.26 7773
of the Revised Code in the manner and to the extent set forth in 7774
the commission's order. In addition, the commission may make an 7775
assessment against the permit holder, satellite facility, or 7776

service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by 7788
certified mail, a petition for reassessment in writing, signed 7789

knowledge of the facts, the assessment shall become conclusive 7791
and the amount of the assessment, together with interest on it, 7792
shall be due and payable from the party assessed to the 7793
commission. The petition shall indicate the objections of the 7794
party assessed, but additional objections may be raised in 7795

Unless the petitioner waives a hearing, the commission 7798
shall assign a time and place for the hearing on the petition 7799
and notify the petitioner of the time and place of the hearing 7800
by personal service or certified mail, but the commission may 7801
continue the hearing from time to time if necessary. 7802
The commission may make such correction to its assessment 7803
as it finds proper. The commission shall serve a copy of its 7804
final determination on the petitioner by personal service or 7805
certified mail, and its decision in the matter is final, subject 7806

Franklin county. The clerk, immediately upon the filing of such 7818
entry, shall enter a judgment for the state against the party 7819
assessed in the amount shown on the entry. 7820
From the date of the filing of the entry in the clerk's 7821
office, any unpaid portion of the assessment, including the 7822
interest, shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed 7823
in section 5703.47 of the Revised Code and shall have the same 7824
effect as other judgments. Execution shall issue upon the 7825
judgment upon request of the commission, and all laws applicable 7826
to sales on execution apply to sales made under the judgment. 7827
If the judgment is entered against the collection and 7828
settlement agent, the commission may immediately proceed against 7829
the agent's bond and surety for the full amount of the judgment 7830
and interest on it. 7831

less than thirty-five hundred signatures of qualified electors, 8083
requesting that there be submitted at a general election or at a 8084
special election, at the discretion of the board, the issue, 8085

county for a period of __________ (not to exceed five) years?", 8087
the board shall submit such issue to the electors of said county 8088
in the manner provided by section 3505.06 of the Revised Code. 8089
If a majority of the electors voting on said issue vote "yes" 8090
thereon, the state racing commission shall have no jurisdiction 8091
thereafter to license meetings in said county for the number of 8092
years, not exceeding five, specified in said petition. If a 8093
majority of the electors voting on said issue or question vote 8094

fee fund, shall be reduced by one per cent of the total amount 8109
wagered for those permit holders who carry out a major capital 8110
improvement project. The percentage of the reduction that may be 8111
taken each racing day shall equal seventy-five per cent of the 8112
amount of the taxes levied under divisions (B) and (C) of 8113
section 3769.08, section 3769.087, and division (F)(2) of 8114
section 3769.26 of the Revised Code, as applicable, divided by 8115
the calculated amount each fund should receive under divisions 8116
(B) and (C) of section 3769.08, section 3769.087, and division 8117
(F)(2) of section 3769.26 of the Revised Code and the reduction 8118
provided for in this section. If the resulting percentage is 8119
less than one, that percentage shall be multiplied by the amount 8120
of the reduction provided for in this section. Otherwise, the 8121
permit holder shall receive the full reduction provided for in 8122
this section. The amount of the allowable reduction not received 8123
shall be carried forward and added to any other reduction 8124
balance and applied against future tax liability. After any 8125
reductions expire, any reduction carried forward shall be 8126
treated as a reduction as provided for in this section. If the 8127
amount of allowable reduction exceeds the amount of taxes 8128
derived from a permit holder, the amount of the allowable 8129
reduction not used may be carried forward and applied against 8130
future tax liability. 8131
If more than one permit holder is authorized to conduct 8132
racing at the facility that is being improved, the cost of the 8133
major capital improvement project shall be allocated between or 8134
among all the permit holders in the ratio that each permit 8135
holder's number of racing days bears to the total number of 8136
racing days conducted at the facility. 8137
A reduction for a major capital improvement project shall 8138
start from the day racing is first conducted following the date 8139

on which the major capital improvement project is completed and 8140
the construction cost has been approved by the state racing 8141
commission, except as otherwise provided in division (E) of this 8142
section, and shall continue until the total tax reduction equals 8143
the cost of the major capital improvement project plus debt 8144
service applicable to the project. In no event, however, shall 8145
any tax reduction, excluding any reduction balances, be 8146
permitted under this section after December 31, 2017. The total 8147
tax reduction because of the major capital improvement project 8148
shall not during any one year exceed for all permit holders 8149
using any one track one per cent of the total amount wagered. 8150
The racing commission shall notify the tax commissioner when the 8151
reduction of tax begins and when it ends. 8152
(B) Each fiscal year, the racing commission shall submit a 8153
report to the tax commissioner, the office of budget and 8154
management, and the legislative service commission. The report 8155
shall identify each capital improvement project undertaken under 8156
this section and in progress at each race track, indicate the 8157
total cost of each project, state the tax reduction that 8158
resulted from each project during the immediately preceding 8159
fiscal year, estimate the tax reduction that will result from 8160
each project during the current fiscal year, state the total tax 8161
reduction that resulted from all such projects at all race 8162
tracks during the immediately preceding fiscal year, and 8163
estimate the total tax reduction that will result from all such 8164
projects at all race tracks during the current fiscal year. 8165
(C) The tax reduction granted pursuant to this section 8166

(D) In order to qualify for the reduction in tax, a permit 8170
holder shall apply to the racing commission in such form as the 8171
commission may require and shall provide full details of the 8172
major capital improvement project, including plans and 8173
specifications, a schedule for the project's construction and 8174
completion, and a breakdown of proposed costs. In addition, the 8175
permit holder shall have commenced construction of the major 8176
capital improvement project or shall have had the application 8177
for the project approved by the racing commission prior to March 8178
29, 1988. The racing commission shall not approve an application 8179
unless the permit holder shows that a contract for the major 8180
capital improvement project has been let under an unrestricted 8181
competitive bidding procedure, unless the contract is exempted 8182
by the controlling board because of its unusual nature. In 8183
determining whether to approve an application, the racing 8184
commission shall consider whether the major capital improvement 8185
project will promote the safety, convenience, and comfort of the 8186
racing public and horse owners and generally tend toward the 8187
improvement of racing in this state. 8188
(E) If the major capital improvement project is approved 8189
by the racing commission and construction has started, the tax 8190
reduction may be authorized by the commission upon presentation 8191
of copies of paid bills in excess of five hundred thousand 8192
dollars. After the initial authorization, the permit holder 8193
shall present copies of paid bills in the amount of not less 8194
than five hundred thousand dollars. If the permit holder is in 8195
substantial compliance with the schedule for construction and 8196
completion of the major capital improvement project, the racing 8197
commission may authorize the continuance of the tax reduction 8198
upon the presentation of the additional paid bills in increments 8199
of five hundred thousand dollars. The racing commission may 8200

S. B. No. 197 Page 280
As Introduced
terminate the tax reduction if a permit holder fails to complete 8201
the major capital improvement project or fails to comply 8202
substantially with the schedule for construction and completion 8203
of the major capital improvement project. If the time for 8204
completion of the major capital improvement project is delayed 8205
by acts of God, strikes, or the unavailability of labor or 8206
materials, the time for completion as set forth in the schedule 8207
shall be extended by the period of the delay. If a permit holder 8208
fails to complete the major capital improvement project, the 8209
racing commission shall order the permit holder to repay to the 8210
state the total amount of tax reduced, unless the permit holder 8211
has spent at least six million dollars on the project. The 8212
normal tax paid by the permit holder under section 3769.08 of 8213
the Revised Code shall be increased by one per cent of the total 8214
amount wagered until the total amount of the additional tax 8215
collected equals the total amount of tax reduced. Any action 8216
taken by the racing commission pursuant to this section in 8217
terminating the tax adjustment or requiring repayment of the 8218
amount of tax reduced shall be subject to Chapter 119. of the 8219
Revised Code. 8220
(F) As used in this section, "major capital improvement 8221
project" means the renovation, reconstruction, or remodeling, 8222

installations of a permanent nature forming a part of the track 8232
structure. 8233
(G) The cost and expenses to which the tax reduction 8234
granted under this section applies shall be determined by 8235
generally accepted accounting principles and be verified by an 8236
audit of the permit holder's records, upon completion of the 8237
major capital improvement project, either by the racing 8238
commission or by an independent certified public accountant 8239
selected by the permit holder and approved by the commission. 8240
(H) This section and section 3769.201 of the Revised Code 8241
govern any tax reduction granted to a permit holder for the cost 8242
to the permit holder of any cleanup, repair, or improvement 8243
required as a result of damage caused by the 1997 Ohio river 8244
flood to the place, track, or enclosure for which the permit is 8245
issued. 8246
Sec. 3769.201. The holder of a permit issued under section 8247
3769.06 of the Revised Code may apply to the state racing 8248
commission for the tax reduction available under section 3769.20 8249
of the Revised Code for the cost to the permit holder of any 8250
cleanup, repair, or improvement required as a result of damage 8251
caused by the 1997 Ohio river flood to the place, track, or 8252
enclosure for which the permit is issued. As part of the 8253
application, the permit holder shall submit evidence of payment 8254
of the cost of the cleanup, repair, or improvement. The 8255
commission shall approve the tax reduction in the amount of the 8256
cost to the permit holder, net of any insurance proceeds, of any 8257
cleanup, repair, or improvement the commission determines was 8258
required as a result of damage caused by the flood. The permit 8259
holder need not have followed unrestricted competitive bidding 8260
procedures as required under section 3769.20 of the Revised Code 8261

to qualify for the reduction under this section. 8262
The permit holder shall claim the tax reduction under this 8263
section in the same manner as if it were a tax reduction for a 8264
major capital improvement project under section 3769.20 of the 8265
Revised Code. The percentage of the reduction that may be taken 8266
each racing day shall equal the percentage allowed for a 8267
reduction under section 3769.20 of the Revised Code. A reduction 8268
under this section shall be in addition to, and shall be taken 8269
after completion of, a reduction approved under section 3769.20 8270
or division (J) of section 3769.08 of the Revised Code. A permit 8271
holder shall not take a reduction under this section for a 8272
repair or improvement for which a reduction is taken under 8273
section 3769.20 or division (J) of section 3769.08 of the 8274
Revised Code. 8275
Sec. 3769.21. (A) A corporation may be formed pursuant to 8276
Chapter 1702. of the Revised Code to establish a thoroughbred 8277
horsemen's health and retirement fund and a corporation may be 8278
formed pursuant to Chapter 1702. of the Revised Code to 8279
establish a harness horsemen's health and retirement fund to be 8280
administered for the benefit of horsemen. As used in this 8281
section, "horsemen" includes any person involved in the owning, 8282
breeding, training, grooming, or racing of horses which race in 8283
Ohio, except for the owners or managers of race tracks. For 8284
purposes of the thoroughbred horsemen's health and retirement 8285
fund, "horsemen" also does not include trainers and grooms who 8286
are not members of the thoroughbred horsemen's organization in 8287
this state. No more than one corporation to establish a 8288
thoroughbred horsemen's health and retirement fund and no more 8289
than one corporation to establish a harness horsemen's health 8290
and retirement fund may be established in Ohio pursuant to this 8291
section. The trustees of the corporation formed to establish a 8292

S. B. No. 197 Page 283
As Introduced
thoroughbred horsemen's health and retirement fund shall have 8293
the discretion to determine which horsemen shall benefit from 8294
such fund. 8295
(B) The articles of incorporation of both of the 8296
corporations described in division (A) of this section shall 8297
provide for at least the following: 8298
(1) The corporation shall be governed by, and the health 8299
and retirement fund shall be administered by, a board of three 8300
trustees appointed pursuant to division (C) of this section for 8301
staggered three-year terms. 8302
(2) The board of trustees shall adopt and administer a 8303
plan to provide health benefits, retirement benefits, or both to 8304
either thoroughbred or harness horsemen. 8305
(3) The sum paid to the corporation pursuant to division 8306
(G) or (H) of section 3769.08 of the Revised Code shall be used 8307
exclusively to establish and administer the health and 8308
retirement fund, and to finance benefits paid to horsemen 8309
pursuant to the plan adopted under division (B)(2) of this 8310
section. 8311
(4) The articles of incorporation and code of regulations 8312
of the corporation may be amended at any time by the board of 8313
trustees pursuant to the method set forth in the articles of 8314
incorporation and code of regulations, except that no amendment 8315
shall be adopted which is inconsistent with this section. 8316
(C) Within sixty days after the formation of each of the 8317
corporations described in division (A) of this section, the 8318
state racing The commission shall appoint the members of the 8319
board boards of trustees of that corporation the corporations 8320
described in division (A) of this section. Vacancies shall be 8321

filled by the state racing commission in the same manner as 8322
initial appointments. Each trustee of the thoroughbred 8323
horsemen's health and retirement fund appointed by the 8324
commission shall be active as a thoroughbred horseman while 8325
serving a term as a trustee and shall have been active as a 8326
thoroughbred horseman for at least five years immediately prior 8327
to the commencement of any such term. Each trustee of the 8328
harness horsemen's health and retirement fund appointed by the 8329
commission shall be active as a harness horseman while serving a 8330
term as a trustee and shall have been active as a harness 8331
horseman for at least five years immediately prior to the 8332
commencement of any such term. The incorporators of either such 8333
corporation may serve as initial trustees until the state racing 8334
commission acts pursuant to this section to make these 8335
appointments. 8336
(D) The intent of the general assembly in enacting this 8337
section pursuant to Amended House Bill No. 639 of the 115th 8338
general assembly was to fulfill a legitimate government 8339
responsibility in a manner that would be more cost efficient and 8340
effective than direct state agency administration by permitting 8341
nonprofit corporations to be formed to establish health and 8342
retirement funds for the benefit of harness and thoroughbred 8343
horsemen, as it was determined that such persons were in need of 8344
such benefits. 8345
Sec. 3769.22. (A) The general assembly finds and declares 8346
all of the following: 8347

state in which they may conduct business. 8357
(3) The compact authorizes the individuals described in 8358
division (A)(2) of this section to be licensed in occupational 8359

uniform minimum standard of honesty and integrity; 8369
(b) Facilitate the growth of the horse racing industry in 8370
each state that is a party to the compact and throughout the 8371
country by simplifying the licensing process for the individuals 8372
described in division (A)(4)(a) of this section and by reducing 8373
the duplicative and costly process of separate licensing by the 8374
applicable agency in each state that is a party to the compact; 8375
(c) Provide for participation in the compact by officials 8376
of the states that are parties to the compact, and permit those 8377
officials, through the compact committee established by the 8378
compact, to enter into contracts with governmental agencies and 8379
nongovernmental persons and entities to carry out the purposes 8380

S. B. No. 197 Page 286

of the compact; 8381
(d) Establish the compact committee as an interstate 8382
governmental entity authorized to request and receive criminal 8383
record history information from the federal bureau of 8384
investigation, other federal law enforcement agencies, the royal 8385
Canadian mounted police, law enforcement agencies of other 8386
nations, and state and local law enforcement agencies. 8387
(5) Both of the following apply under the compact: 8388
(a) No state that is party to the compact, including that 8389
state's racing commission or equivalent agency, is liable for 8390
the debts or other financial obligations incurred by the compact 8391
committee. 8392
(b) No official of a state that is a party to the compact 8393
or employee of the compact committee is personally liable for 8394
any act the official or employee performs or omits to perform in 8395
good faith while carrying out the official's or employee's 8396
responsibilities and duties under the compact. 8397
(B)(1) The state racing commission is hereby authorized to 8398
enter into and participate in the compact described in division 8399
(A) of this section for the purposes described in that division. 8400
(2) The participation of this state and the commission in 8401
the compact shall not have any of the following consequences: 8402
(a) Result in the diminution of any applicable existing 8403
standards governing the issuance, denial, suspension, or 8404
revocation of a license issued under section 3769.03 of the 8405
Revised Code; 8406
(b) Prevent the enforcement of any statute or rule 8407
affecting the holder of any such license; 8408

S. B. No. 197 Page 287
As Introduced
(c) Relieve any individual or entity of its duty to obtain 8409

perform in good faith while carrying out the official's or 8416
employee's responsibilities and duties under the compact. 8417
(3) The commission shall designate an individual to 8418
represent this state and the commission on the compact committee 8419
in the administration of the compact. 8420

(2) Prior to a track's establishing satellite facilities 8468
under this section, the permit holders at that track shall agree 8469
among themselves regarding their respective rights and 8470
obligations with respect to those satellite facilities. 8471
(3)(a) Any track that desires to establish a satellite 8472

notification to all other tracks in this state, and the 8478
commission shall, within forty-five days after receiving the 8479
notification, hold a hearing on the track's intent to establish 8480
a satellite facility. At this hearing the commission shall 8481
consider the evidence presented and determine whether the 8482

investigation on each person who is the owner of a premises 8498
where a satellite facility is proposed to be located or who is 8499
proposed to be the operator or an employee of a satellite 8500
facility. The commission shall adopt rules in accordance with 8501
Chapter 119. of the Revised Code that specify the specific 8502
information the commission shall collect in conducting such a 8503
background investigation. 8504
No track shall knowingly contract with a person as the 8505
owner of the premises where a satellite facility is located, or 8506
knowingly employ a person as the operator or an employee of a 8507
satellite facility, who has been convicted of or pleaded guilty 8508
to a gambling offense that is a felony or any other felony under 8509
the laws of this state, any other state, or the United States 8510
that the commission determines to be related to fitness to be 8511

track that violates any of these prohibitions. 8515
(b) Each track that receives the notification described in 8516
division (A)(3)(a) of this section shall notify the commission 8517
and the track that desires to establish the satellite facility, 8518
within thirty days after receiving the notification from the 8519

in the joint ownership of the facility. Ownership shall be 8521
distributed equally among the tracks that choose to participate 8522
in the joint ownership of the facility unless the participating 8523
tracks agree to and contract otherwise. Tracks that fail to 8524
respond to the commission and the track that desires to 8525
establish the satellite facility within this thirty-day period 8526
regarding the ownership of the particular satellite facility are 8527

track in existence on September 27, 1994, does not establish 8530
both of the satellite facilities it is authorized to establish 8531
under division (A) of this section, another track, with the 8532
approval of the racing commission, may establish in accordance 8533
with this section a number of additional satellite facilities 8534

permit holder in this state shall allow the races that it 8539
conducts, and the races conducted outside this state that it 8540
receives as a simulcast host, to be simulcast to all satellite 8541
facilities operating in this state and shall take all action 8542
necessary to supply its simulcast and wagering information to 8543
these satellite facilities. A permit holder at a track where the 8544
average daily amount wagered for all race meetings during 8545
calendar year 1990 did not exceed two hundred fifty thousand 8546
dollars may elect not to simulcast its races to the satellite 8547
facilities. If a permit holder at such a track chooses to 8548
simulcast its races to satellite facilities, it shall allow its 8549
races to be simulcast to all satellite facilities operating in 8550
this state. Except as otherwise provided in this division, each 8551
satellite facility shall receive simulcasts of and conduct pari- 8552
mutuel wagering on all live racing programs being conducted at 8553
any track in this state and on all agreed simulcast racing 8554
programs, as provided in division (D)(C) of section 3769.089 of 8555
the Revised Code, conducted in other states that are received by 8556
simulcast in this state, without regard to the breed of horse 8557
competing in the race or the time of day of the race. 8558

No satellite facility may receive simulcasts of horse 8559
races during the same hours that a county fair or independent 8560
fair located within the same county as the satellite facility is 8561
conducting pari-mutuel wagering on horse races at that county or 8562
independent fair. 8563
Except as otherwise provided in this division, the 8564
commission shall not approve the establishment of a satellite 8565
facility within a radius of fifty miles of any track. The 8566
commission may approve the establishment of a satellite facility 8567
at a location within a radius of at least thirty-five but not 8568
more than fifty miles from one or more tracks if all of the 8569
holders of permits issued for those tracks consent in writing to 8570
the establishment of the satellite facility. The commission may 8571
approve the establishment of a satellite facility at a location 8572
within a radius of thirty-five miles of more than one race track 8573
if all holders of permits issued for those tracks consent in 8574
writing to the establishment of the satellite facility and, if 8575
the tracks are located completely within one county and the 8576
proposed satellite facility will be located within that county, 8577
if both the legislative authority of the municipal corporation 8578
in that county with the largest population, and the appropriate 8579
legislative authority that is required to approve the satellite 8580
facility under division (A)(1) of this section, approve the 8581
establishment of the new satellite facility. The commission may 8582
approve the establishment of a satellite facility at a location 8583
within a radius of less than twenty miles from an existing 8584
satellite facility if the owner of the existing satellite 8585
facility consents in writing to the establishment of the new 8586
satellite facility. 8587
A satellite facility shall not receive simulcasts of horse 8588
races conducted outside this state on any day when no simulcast 8589

host is operating. 8590
(D) Each simulcast host is responsible for paying all 8591
costs associated with the up-link for simulcasts. Each satellite 8592
facility is responsible for paying all costs associated with the 8593
reception of simulcasts and the operation of the satellite 8594
facility. 8595
(E) All money wagered at the simulcast host, and all money 8596
wagered at all satellite facilities on races simulcast from the 8597
simulcast host, shall be included in a common pari-mutuel pool 8598
at the simulcast host. Except as otherwise provided in division 8599
(F)(6) of this section, the payment shall be the same for all 8600
winning tickets whether a wager is placed at a simulcast host or 8601
a satellite facility. Wagers placed at a satellite facility 8602
shall conform in denomination, character, terms, conditions, and 8603
in all other respects to wagers placed at the simulcast host for 8604
the same race. 8605
(F)(1) As used in division (F) of this section, "effective 8606
rate" means the effective gross tax percentage applicable at the 8607
simulcast host, determined in accordance with sections 3769.08 8608

(2) For the purposes of calculating the amount of taxes to 8612
be paid and the amount of commissions to be retained by permit 8613
holders, fifty per cent of the amount wagered at satellite 8614
facilities on a live racing program simulcast from a simulcast 8615
host shall be allocated to the permit holder's live race 8616
wagering at that simulcast host that conducts the live racing 8617
program, and fifty per cent of the amount wagered at satellite 8618
facilities on simulcast racing programs conducted outside this 8619

state shall be allocated to, and apportioned equally among, the 8620
permit holders acting as simulcast hosts for the out-of-state 8621
simulcast racing programs. The remainder of the amount wagered 8622
at a satellite facility on races simulcast from a simulcast host 8623
shall be allocated to the satellite facility. In computing the 8624
tax due on the amount allocated to the satellite facility, if 8625
there is more than one simulcast host for out-of-state simulcast 8626
racing programs, the effective rate applied by the satellite 8627
facility shall be the tax rate applicable to the simulcast host 8628
that pays the highest effective rate under section 3769.08 of 8629
the Revised Code on such simulcast racing programs. 8630
(3) The portion of the amount wagered that is allocated to 8631
a simulcast host under division (F)(2) of this section shall be 8632
treated, for the purposes of calculating the amount of taxes to 8633
be paid and commissions to be retained, as having been wagered 8634
at the simulcast host on a live racing program or on a simulcast 8635
racing program. The permit holder at the simulcast host shall 8636
pay, in the manner prescribed under section 3769.103 of the 8637
Revised Code, as a tax, the tax specified in sections 3769.08 8638
and 3769.087 of the Revised Code, as applicable, except that the 8639
tax shall be calculated using the effective rate, and the permit 8640
holder may retain as a commission the percentage of the amount 8641
wagered as specified in those sections. From the tax collected, 8642
the tax commissioner shall make distributions to the respective 8643
funds, and in the proper amounts, as required by sections 8644
3769.08 and 3769.087 of the Revised Code, as applicable. 8645
(4) From the portion of the amount wagered that is 8646
allocated to a satellite facility under division (F)(2) of this 8647
section, the satellite facility may retain as a commission the 8648
amount specified in section 3769.08 or 3769.087 of the Revised 8649

effective rate as follows: 8652
(a) One per cent of such amount allocated to the satellite 8653
facility shall be paid as a tax each racing day to the tax 8654
commissioner for deposit into the nursing home franchise permit 8655
fee fund. 8656
(b) The remaining balance of the taxes calculated at the 8657
effective rate, after payment of the tax specified in division 8658
(F)(4)(a) of this section, shall be retained by the satellite 8659
facility to pay for those costs associated with the reception of 8660
the simulcasts. 8661
(5) From the commission retained by a satellite facility 8662
after the deduction of the tax paid at the effective rate under 8663
division (F)(4) of this section, the satellite facility shall 8664
retain an amount equal to two and three-eighths per cent of the 8665
amount wagered that day on simulcast racing programs and the 8666
balance shall be divided as follows: 8667
(a) One-half shall be paid to the owner of the satellite 8668
facility; 8669
(b) One-half shall be paid to the state racing commission 8670
for deposit into the Ohio combined simulcast horse racing purse 8671
fund. 8672
(6) In addition to the commission retained under this 8673
section, a satellite facility shall retain two and one-half per 8674
cent of the amount that would otherwise be paid on each winning 8675
wager unless the retention of this amount would either cause or 8676
add to a minus pool. As used in division (F)(6) of this section, 8677
"minus pool" means a wagering pool in which a winning wager is 8678
paid off at less than one hundred ten per cent of the amount of 8679

the tax commissioner for deposit into the nursing home franchise 8681
permit fee fund. 8682
(7) At the close of each day, each satellite facility 8683
shall pay, by check, draft, or money order, or by wire transfer 8684
of funds, out of the money retained on that day to the 8685
collection and settlement agent the required fee to be paid by 8686
the simulcast host to the tracks, racing associations, or state 8687
regulatory agencies located outside this state for simulcasts 8688
into this state computed and based on one-half of the amount 8689
wagered at the satellite facility that day on interstate 8690
simulcast racing programs. 8691
(G) No license, fee, or excise tax, other than as 8692
specified in division (F)(6) of this section, shall be assessed 8693
upon or collected from a satellite facility, the owners of a 8694
satellite facility, or the holders of permits issued for a track 8695
that has established a satellite facility by any county, 8696
township, municipal corporation, district, or other body having 8697
the authority to assess or collect a tax or fee. 8698
(H) In no case shall that portion of the commissions 8699
designated for purses from satellite facilities be less than 8700
that portion of those commissions designated for purses at the 8701
simulcast host. 8702
(I) It is the intention of the general assembly in 8703
enacting this section not to adversely affect the amounts paid 8704
into the Ohio thoroughbred race fund created under section 8705
3769.083 of the Revised Code. Therefore, each track that acts as 8706
a simulcast host under this section shall calculate, on a semi- 8707
annual basis during calendar years 1994, 1995, and 1996, its 8708
average daily contribution to the Ohio thoroughbred race fund 8709

S. B. No. 197 Page 297

created under section 3769.083 of the Revised Code on those days 8710
on which the track conducted live horse racing. If this average 8711
daily contribution to the fund is less than the average daily 8712
contribution from the same track to the fund during the same 8713
six-month period of calendar year 1992, there shall be 8714
contributed to the fund an amount equal to the average daily 8715
shortfall multiplied by the number of days of live racing 8716
conducted during the six-month period in calendar year 1994, 8717
1995, or 1996, as applicable. The amount of such contribution 8718
shall be allocated among the simulcast host, the purse program 8719
at the simulcast host, and the satellite facilities for which 8720
the track served as the simulcast host, on a pro rata basis in 8721
proportion to the amounts contributed by them to the fund during 8722
such six-month period in calendar year 1994, 1995, or 1996, as 8723
applicable. 8724

(A)(10)(a) of this section, "dependent" includes a person who 17284
otherwise would be a "qualifying relative" and thus a 17285
"dependent" under section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code but 17286
for the fact that the person fails to meet the income and 17287
support limitations under section 152(d)(1)(B) and (C) of the 17288
Internal Revenue Code. 17289
(11)(a) Deduct any amount included in federal adjusted 17290

reimbursement or refund of expenses that in any year the 17292
taxpayer had deducted as an itemized deduction pursuant to 17293
section 63 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable United 17294
States department of the treasury regulations. The deduction 17295
otherwise allowed under division (A)(11)(a) of this section 17296
shall be reduced to the extent the reimbursement is attributable 17297
to an amount the taxpayer deducted under this section in any 17298
taxable year. 17299
(b) Add any amount not otherwise included in Ohio adjusted 17300
gross income for any taxable year to the extent that the amount 17301

adjusted gross income in any taxable year. 17304
(12) Deduct any portion of the deduction described in 17305
section 1341(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, for repaying 17306

included in the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for a prior 17310
taxable year and did not qualify for a credit under division (A) 17311
or (B) of section 5747.05 of the Revised Code for that year; 17312
(b) It does not otherwise reduce the taxpayer's adjusted 17313

net investment earnings of, a medical savings account during the 17316
taxable year, in accordance with section 3924.66 of the Revised 17317

otherwise deducted or excluded for the current or any other 17320
taxable year from the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income. 17321
(14)(a) Add an amount equal to the funds withdrawn from a 17322
medical savings account during the taxable year, and the net 17323

were used for any purpose other than to reimburse an account 17325
holder for, or to pay, eligible medical expenses, in accordance 17326
with section 3924.66 of the Revised Code; 17327
(b) Add the amounts distributed from a medical savings 17328
account under division (A)(2) of section 3924.68 of the Revised 17329

computation of the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income as 17335
required to be reported for the taxpayer's taxable year under 17336

convincing evidence, complete information about the location and 18222
cost of the physical assets of the lower pass-through entity is 18223
not available to the upper level pass-through entity, then 18224
solely for purposes of ascertaining if a gain or loss 18225
constitutes a qualifying trust amount, the upper level pass- 18226
through entity shall be deemed as owning no equity of the lower 18227
level pass-through entity for each day during the upper level 18228
pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year in which or with 18229
which ends the lower level pass-through entity's calendar or 18230

amounts resulting from the adjustment under this division in the 18405
preceding year, adding the resulting product to the 18406

(4) If a pass-through entity makes the election provided 18833
for under division (D) of this section, the pass-through entity 18834
shall be liable for any additional taxes, interest, interest 18835
penalty, or penalties imposed by this chapter if the tax 18836
commissioner finds that the single return does not reflect the 18837
correct tax due by the pass-through entity investors covered by 18838
that return. Nothing in this division shall be construed to 18839
limit or alter the liability, if any, imposed on pass-through 18840
entity investors for unpaid or underpaid taxes, interest, 18841
interest penalty, or penalties as a result of the pass-through 18842
entity's making the election provided for under division (D) of 18843
this section. For the purposes of division (D) of this section, 18844
"correct tax due" means the tax that would have been paid by the 18845
pass-through entity had the single return been filed in a manner 18846
reflecting the commissioner's findings. Nothing in division (D) 18847
of this section shall be construed to make or hold a pass- 18848
through entity liable for tax attributable to a pass-through 18849
entity investor's income from a source other than the pass- 18850
through entity electing to file the single return. 18851
(E) If a husband and wife file a joint federal income tax 18852
return for a taxable year, they shall file a joint return under 18853
this section for that taxable year, and their liabilities are 18854
joint and several, but, if the federal income tax liability of 18855
either spouse is determined on a separate federal income tax 18856
return, they shall file separate returns under this section. 18857
If either spouse is not required to file a federal income 18858
tax return and either or both are required to file a return 18859
pursuant to this chapter, they may elect to file separate or 18860
joint returns, and, pursuant to that election, their liabilities 18861
are separate or joint and several. If a husband and wife file 18862
separate returns pursuant to this chapter, each must claim the 18863

(F) Each return or notice required to be filed under this 18867
section shall contain the signature of the taxpayer or the 18868
taxpayer's duly authorized agent and of the person who prepared 18869
the return for the taxpayer, and shall include the taxpayer's 18870
social security number. Each return shall be verified by a 18871
declaration under the penalties of perjury. The tax commissioner 18872
shall prescribe the form that the signature and declaration 18873
shall take. 18874
(G) Each return or notice required to be filed under this 18875
section shall be made and filed as required by section 5747.04 18876
of the Revised Code, on or before the fifteenth day of April of 18877
each year, on forms that the tax commissioner shall prescribe, 18878
together with remittance made payable to the treasurer of state 18879
in the combined amount of the state and all school district 18880
income taxes shown to be due on the form. 18881
Upon good cause shown, the commissioner may extend the 18882
period for filing any notice or return required to be filed 18883
under this section and may adopt rules relating to extensions. 18884
If the extension results in an extension of time for the payment 18885
of any state or school district income tax liability with 18886
respect to which the return is filed, the taxpayer shall pay at 18887
the time the tax liability is paid an amount of interest 18888
computed at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of 18889
the Revised Code on that liability from the time that payment is 18890
due without extension to the time of actual payment. Except as 18891
provided in section 5747.132 of the Revised Code, in addition to 18892
all other interest charges and penalties, all taxes imposed 18893

until the day an assessment is issued under section 5747.13 of 18898
the Revised Code, whichever occurs first. 18899
If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to 18900
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by section 5747.02 of the 18901
Revised Code or any tax imposed under Chapter 5748. of the 18902
Revised Code, the commissioner may require returns and payments 18903
to be made otherwise than as provided in this section. 18904
To the extent that any provision in this division 18905
conflicts with any provision in section 5747.026 of the Revised 18906
Code, the provision in that section prevails. 18907
(H) The amounts withheld pursuant to section 5747.06, 18908
5747.062, 5747.063, 5747.064, 5747.065, or 5747.071 of the 18909
Revised Code shall be allowed to the ultimate recipient of the 18910
income as credits against payment of the appropriate taxes 18911
imposed on the ultimate recipient by section 5747.02 and under 18912
Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code. As used in this division, 18913
"ultimate recipient" means the person who is required to report 18914
income from which amounts are withheld pursuant to section 18915
5747.06, 5747.062, 5747.063, 5747.064, 5747.065, or 5747.071 of 18916

(I) If a pass-through entity elects to file a single 18919
return under division (D) of this section and if any investor is 18920

return, the investor is entitled to a refundable credit equal to 18925
the investor's proportionate share of the tax paid by the pass- 18926
through entity on behalf of the investor. The investor shall 18927
claim the credit for the investor's taxable year in which or 18928
with which ends the taxable year of the pass-through entity. 18929
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow any credit 18930
provided in this chapter to be claimed more than once. For the 18931
purpose of computing any interest, penalty, or interest penalty, 18932
the investor shall be deemed to have paid the refundable credit 18933
provided by this division on the day that the pass-through 18934
entity paid the estimated tax or the tax giving rise to the 18935
credit. 18936
(J) The tax commissioner shall ensure that each return 18937
required to be filed under this section includes a box that the 18938
taxpayer may check to authorize a paid tax preparer who prepared 18939
the return to communicate with the department of taxation about 18940
matters pertaining to the return. The return or instructions 18941
accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box 18942
the taxpayer authorizes the department of taxation to contact 18943
the preparer concerning questions that arise during the 18944
processing of the return and authorizes the preparer only to 18945
provide the department with information that is missing from the 18946
return, to contact the department for information about the 18947
processing of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund 18948
or payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical 18949
errors, offsets, or return preparation that the taxpayer has 18950
received from the department and has shown to the preparer. 18951

(L) If, for the taxable year, a nonresident or trust that 18961
is the owner of an electing pass-through entity, as defined in 18962
section 5747.38 of the Revised Code, does not have Ohio adjusted 18963
gross income or, in the case of a trust, modified Ohio taxable 18964
income other than from one or more electing pass-through 18965
entities, the nonresident or trust shall not be required to file 18966
an annual return under this section. Nothing in this division 18967
precludes such an owner from filing the annual return under this 18968
section, utilizing the refundable credit under section 5747.39 18969
of the Revised Code equal to the owner's proportionate share of 18970
the tax levied under section 5747.38 of the Revised Code and 18971
paid by the electing pass-through entity, and making the payment 18972

the debt owed under division (A) of this section, it may be 18995
applied in partial satisfaction of the debt. If the amount 18996
refundable is greater than the amount of that debt, the amount 18997
remaining after satisfaction of the debt shall be refunded. If 18998
the person has more than one debt listed in division (A) of this 18999
section, any debt subject to section 5739.33 or division (G) of 19000
section 5747.07 of the Revised Code or arising under section 19001
5747.063 or 5747.064 of the Revised Code shall be satisfied 19002

Code, this section applies only to debts that have become final. 19005
(D) The tax commissioner may charge each respective agency 19006
of the state for the commissioner's cost in applying refunds to 19007
debts due to the state and may charge the attorney general for 19008
the commissioner's cost in applying refunds to certified claims. 19009
(E) The commissioner may promulgate rules to implement 19010
this section. The rules may address, among other things, 19011

5747.05 of the Revised Code and computing income taxable in this 19022
state under division (D) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code. 19023
All items of nonbusiness income or deduction shall be 19024
allocated in this state as follows: 19025
(A) All items of nonbusiness income or deduction taken 19026
into account in the computation of adjusted gross income for the 19027
taxable year by a resident shall be allocated to this state. 19028
(B) All items of nonbusiness income or deduction taken 19029
into account in the computation of adjusted gross income for the 19030
taxable year by a nonresident shall be allocated to this state 19031

personal services performed in this state who was a nonresident 19034

allocated thereto shall be allocated to this state. 19036
(2) All gains or losses from the sale of real property, 19037
tangible personal property, or intangible property shall be 19038

(b) Capital gains or losses from the sale or other 19043
transfer of tangible personal property are allocable to this 19044
state if, at the time of such sale or other transfer, the 19045
property had its physical location in this state. 19046
(c) Capital gains or losses from the sale or other 19047
transfer of intangible personal property are allocable to this 19048

(a) Rents and royalties derived from real property are 19053
allocable to this state if the property is physically located in 19054
this state. 19055
(b) Rents and royalties derived from tangible personal 19056
property are allocable to this state to the extent that such 19057
property is utilized in this state. 19058
The extent of utilization of tangible personal property in 19059
a state is determined by multiplying the rents or royalties 19060
derived from such property by a fraction, the numerator of which 19061
is the number of days of physical location of the property in 19062
this state during the rental or royalty period in the taxable 19063
year and the denominator of which is the number of days of 19064
physical location of the property everywhere during all rental 19065
or royalty periods in the taxable year. If the physical location 19066
of the property during the rental or royalty period is unknown 19067
or unascertainable by the nonresident, tangible personal 19068
property is utilized in the state in which the property was 19069

employed in production, fabrication, manufacturing, or other 19076
processing in the state, or to the extent that a patented 19077
product is produced in the state. If the basis of receipts from 19078
patent royalties does not permit allocation to states or if the 19079
accounting procedures do not reflect states of utilization, the 19080
patent is utilized in this state if the taxpayer's domicile was 19081
in this state at the time such royalties were paid or accrued. 19082
A copyright is utilized in a state to the extent that 19083
printing or other publication originates in the state. If the 19084
basis of receipts from copyright royalties does not permit 19085
allocation to states or if the accounting procedures do not 19086
reflect states of utilization, the copyright is utilized in this 19087
state if the taxpayer's domicile was in this state at the time 19088
such royalties were paid or accrued. 19089
