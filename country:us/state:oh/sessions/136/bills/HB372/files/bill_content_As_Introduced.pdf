(2) Upon consideration of the relevant evidence raised at 264
trial, the testimony, other evidence, statement of the offender, 265
arguments of counsel, and, if applicable, the reports submitted 266
pursuant to division (D)(1) of this section, the trial jury, if 267
the offender was tried by a jury, shall determine whether the 268

outweigh the mitigating factors, the trial jury shall recommend 274

a sentencing hearing is held pursuant to this section is not 448
final until the opinion is filed. 449
(G)(1) Whenever the court or a panel of three judges 450
imposes a sentence of death for an offense committed before 451
January 1, 1995, the clerk of the court in which the judgment is 452
rendered shall make and retain a copy of the entire record in 453
the case, and shall deliver the original of the entire record in 454
the case to the appellate court. 455

States, the governor-elect or lieutenant governor-elect of this 476

jury, or panel of three judges shall consider, and weigh against 560

duress, coercion, or strong provocation; 569
(3) Whether, at the time of committing the offense, the 570
offender, because of a mental disease or defect, lacked 571

H. B. No. 372 Page 21

whether the offender should be sentenced to death. 583
(C) The defendant shall be given great latitude in the 584
presentation of evidence of the factors listed in division (B) 585
of this section and of any other factors in mitigation of the 586
imposition of the sentence of death. 587
The existence of any of the mitigating factors listed in 588
division (B) of this section does not preclude the imposition of 589
a sentence of death on the offender but shall be weighed 590
pursuant to divisions (D)(2) and (3) of section 2929.03 of the 591
Revised Code by the trial court, trial jury, or the panel of 592
three judges against the aggravating circumstances the offender 593
was found guilty of committing. 594
Section 2. That existing sections 2903.01, 2929.03, and 595
2929.04 of the Revised Code are hereby repealed. 596
Section 3. This act shall be known as the Larry Henderson 597
Act. 598
Section 4. Section 2929.03 of the Revised Code is 599
presented in this act as a composite of the section as amended 600
by both H.B. 136 and S.B. 256 of the 133rd General Assembly. The 601
General Assembly, applying the principle stated in division (B) 602
of section 1.52 of the Revised Code that amendments are to be 603
harmonized if reasonably capable of simultaneous operation, 604
finds that the composite is the resulting version of the section 605
in effect prior to the effective date of the section as 606
presented in this act. 607
