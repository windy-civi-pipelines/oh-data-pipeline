spouse, and dependents. No deduction for medical care insurance 2221
under division (A)(10)(a) of this section shall be allowed 2222
either to any taxpayer who is eligible to participate in any 2223
subsidized health plan maintained by any employer of the 2224
taxpayer or of the taxpayer's spouse, or to any taxpayer who is 2225
entitled to, or on application would be entitled to, benefits 2226
under part A of Title XVIII of the "Social Security Act," 49 2227
Stat. 620 (1935), 42 U.S.C. 301, as amended. For the purposes of 2228
division (A)(10)(a) of this section, "subsidized health plan" 2229
means a health plan for which the employer pays any portion of 2230
the plan's cost. The deduction allowed under division (A)(10)(a) 2231

during the taxable year, the amount the taxpayer paid during the 2237
taxable year, not compensated for by any insurance or otherwise, 2238
for medical care of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, and 2239
dependents, to the extent the expenses exceed seven and one-half 2240
per cent of the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income. 2241
(c) For purposes of division (A)(10) of this section, 2242
"medical care" has the meaning given in section 213 of the 2243
Internal Revenue Code, subject to the special rules, 2244
limitations, and exclusions set forth therein, and "qualified 2245
long-term care" has the same meaning given in section 7702B(c) 2246
of the Internal Revenue Code. Solely for purposes of division 2247
(A)(10)(a) of this section, "dependent" includes a person who 2248
otherwise would be a "qualifying relative" and thus a 2249
"dependent" under section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code but 2250
for the fact that the person fails to meet the income and 2251
support limitations under section 152(d)(1)(B) and (C) of the 2252
Internal Revenue Code. 2253
(11)(a) Deduct any amount included in federal adjusted 2254
gross income solely because the amount represents a 2255
reimbursement or refund of expenses that in any year the 2256
taxpayer had deducted as an itemized deduction pursuant to 2257
section 63 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable United 2258
States department of the treasury regulations. The deduction 2259
otherwise allowed under division (A)(11)(a) of this section 2260
shall be reduced to the extent the reimbursement is attributable 2261
to an amount the taxpayer deducted under this section in any 2262
taxable year. 2263
(b) Add any amount not otherwise included in Ohio adjusted 2264
gross income for any taxable year to the extent that the amount 2265

is attributable to the recovery during the taxable year of any 2266
amount deducted or excluded in computing federal or Ohio 2267
adjusted gross income in any taxable year. 2268
(12) Deduct any portion of the deduction described in 2269
section 1341(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, for repaying 2270
previously reported income received under a claim of right, that 2271
meets both of the following requirements: 2272
(a) It is allowable for repayment of an item that was 2273
included in the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for a prior 2274
taxable year and did not qualify for a credit under division (A) 2275
or (B) of section 5747.05 of the Revised Code for that year; 2276
(b) It does not otherwise reduce the taxpayer's adjusted 2277
gross income for the current or any other taxable year. 2278
(13) Deduct an amount equal to the deposits made to, and 2279
net investment earnings of, a medical savings account during the 2280
taxable year, in accordance with section 3924.66 of the Revised 2281
Code. The deduction allowed by division (A)(13) of this section 2282
does not apply to medical savings account deposits and earnings 2283
otherwise deducted or excluded for the current or any other 2284
taxable year from the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income. 2285
(14)(a) Add an amount equal to the funds withdrawn from a 2286
medical savings account during the taxable year, and the net 2287
investment earnings on those funds, when the funds withdrawn 2288
were used for any purpose other than to reimburse an account 2289
holder for, or to pay, eligible medical expenses, in accordance 2290
with section 3924.66 of the Revised Code; 2291
(b) Add the amounts distributed from a medical savings 2292
account under division (A)(2) of section 3924.68 of the Revised 2293
Code during the taxable year. 2294

(a) The amount was deducted or excluded from the 2298
computation of the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income as 2299
required to be reported for the taxpayer's taxable year under 2300
the Internal Revenue Code; 2301
(b) The amount resulted in a reduction of the taxpayer's 2302
federal adjusted gross income as required to be reported for any 2303
of the taxpayer's taxable years under the Internal Revenue Code. 2304
(16) Deduct the amount contributed by the taxpayer to an 2305
individual development account program established by a county 2306
department of job and family services pursuant to sections 2307
329.11 to 329.14 of the Revised Code for the purpose of matching 2308
funds deposited by program participants. On request of the tax 2309

(ii) The trust's qualifying investment income, as defined 3091
in section 5747.012 of the Revised Code, but only to the extent 3092
the qualifying investment income does not otherwise constitute 3093
modified business income and does not otherwise constitute a 3094
qualifying trust amount. 3095
(b) The qualifying trust amount multiplied by a fraction, 3096

income satisfying the descriptions in divisions (B)(2) to (5) of 3117
section 5747.20 of the Revised Code, except as otherwise 3118
provided in division (AA)(4)(c)(ii) of this section. With 3119
respect to a trust or portion of a trust that is not a resident 3120
as ascertained in accordance with division (I)(3)(d) of this 3121
section, the trust's portion of modified nonbusiness income 3122
recognized from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of a 3123
debt interest in or equity interest in a section 5747.212 3124
entity, as defined in section 5747.212 of the Revised Code, 3125
without regard to division (A) of that section, shall not be 3126

the Revised Code but shall be apportioned to this state in 3128
accordance with division (B) of section 5747.212 of the Revised 3129
Code without regard to division (A) of that section. 3130

under divisions (AA)(4)(a) and (c) of this section do not fairly 3132
represent the modified Ohio taxable income of the trust in this 3133
state, the alternative methods described in division (C) of 3134
section 5747.21 of the Revised Code may be applied in the manner 3135
and to the same extent provided in that section. 3136

controlled group on the last day of the qualifying investee's 3145
fiscal or calendar year ending immediately prior to the date on 3146
which the trust recognizes the gain or loss, then "qualifying 3147
investee" includes all persons in the qualifying controlled 3148
group on such last day. 3149
(ii) If the qualifying investee, or if the qualifying 3150
investee and any members of the qualifying controlled group of 3151

loss, separately or cumulatively own, directly or indirectly, on 3155
the last day of the qualifying investee's fiscal or calendar 3156
year ending immediately prior to the date on which the trust 3157
recognizes the qualifying trust amount, more than fifty per cent 3158
of the equity of a pass-through entity, then the qualifying 3159
investee and the other members are deemed to own the 3160
proportionate share of the pass-through entity's physical assets 3161
which the pass-through entity directly or indirectly owns on the 3162
last day of the pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year 3163

fiscal or calendar year ending immediately prior to the date on 3165
which the trust recognizes the qualifying trust amount. 3166

section, "upper level pass-through entity" means a pass-through 3168
entity directly or indirectly owning any equity of another pass- 3169

An upper level pass-through entity, whether or not it is 3172
also a qualifying investee, is deemed to own, on the last day of 3173
the upper level pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year, 3174
the proportionate share of the lower level pass-through entity's 3175
physical assets that the lower level pass-through entity 3176
directly or indirectly owns on the last day of the lower level 3177
pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year ending within or 3178
with the last day of the upper level pass-through entity's 3179

upper level pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year in 3183
which or with which ends the calendar or fiscal year of the 3184
lower level pass-through entity and if, based upon clear and 3185
convincing evidence, complete information about the location and 3186
cost of the physical assets of the lower pass-through entity is 3187
not available to the upper level pass-through entity, then 3188
solely for purposes of ascertaining if a gain or loss 3189
constitutes a qualifying trust amount, the upper level pass- 3190
through entity shall be deemed as owning no equity of the lower 3191
level pass-through entity for each day during the upper level 3192
pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year in which or with 3193
which ends the lower level pass-through entity's calendar or 3194
fiscal year. Nothing in division (AA)(5)(a)(iii) of this section 3195
shall be construed to provide for any deduction or exclusion in 3196
computing any trust's Ohio taxable income. 3197
(b) With respect to a trust that is not a resident for the 3198
taxable year and with respect to a part of a trust that is not a 3199
resident for the taxable year, "qualifying investee" for that 3200
taxable year does not include a C corporation if both of the 3201
