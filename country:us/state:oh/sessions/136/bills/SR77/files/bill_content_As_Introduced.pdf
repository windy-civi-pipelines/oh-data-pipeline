Honoring the Village of Millersport on its
Bicentennial.
WHEREAS, The members of the Senate of the 136th General Assembly 1
of Ohio are pleased to recognize the Village of Millersport on the 2
jubilant occasion of its Two Hundredth Anniversary; and 3
WHEREAS, This is, indeed, an auspicious milestone, and celebration 4
is certainly in order. Since its inception two hundred years ago, the 5
Village of Millersport has experienced dramatic growth and change, and 6
yet, commendably, even as its residents have exuberantly embraced the 7
promise of a bright future, they have never relinquished their 8
appreciation for the worthiest virtues of the past. Without 9
sacrificing their sense of tradition in the name of progress, the 10
people of Millersport have managed to nurture a fresh perspective and 11
a positive outlook that endear this distinctive place to all who know 12
it well; and 13
WHEREAS, Two centuries after it was founded, Millersport still 14
radiates vitality, optimism, and a charm all its own, and its success 15
is a testament to the collective pride shared by the villageâ€™s astute 16
leadership, hard-working public servants, and civic-minded residents. 17
Clearly, it is a place of many engaging qualities, and its schools, 18
businesses, and organizations both embody and thrive upon the values 19
of which our flag is an emblem; and 20
WHEREAS, Every state depends upon such vibrant, durable 21
communities as Millersport for its own survival and stability. 22
Although it has known adversity and tribulation, the village also has 23
been favored with its share of blessings. In the years to come, 24
Millersport is sure to remain on its admirable course and to continue 25
to transform challenges into opportunities; therefore be it 26
