Honoring Hotel Lakeside on the occasion of its
Sesquicentennial.
General Assembly of Ohio are pleased to congratulate Hotel Lakeside on 2
the memorable occasion of its One Hundred Fiftieth Anniversary 3
celebration and rededication ceremony; and 4
WHEREAS, Recognition of this prestigious milestone is, indeed, a 5
fitting tribute to Hotel Lakeside, for since its establishment fifteen 6
decades ago, this historic building has achieved a praiseworthy record 7
of service to the community. Indeed, it is considered by many to be a 8
cornerstone of the Lakeside Chautauqua region, and its success is a 9
fine reflection not only on the edifice itself but also on the 10
countless local residents that have joined to celebrate this 11
anniversary; and 12
WHEREAS, By welcoming innumerable people to the Lake Erie area, 13
Hotel Lakeside has enhanced the quality of life within the surrounding 14
area, and it has earned the gratitude and respect of the community and 15
guests it has so capably served. We are confident that as this site 16
begins a new chapter in its existence, it will continue in the 17
tradition of excellence which has been the hallmark of the hotel; and 18
WHEREAS, In this modern era, in which the durability of goods and 19
values is often measured in months and days rather than in years and 20
decades, it is not only enlightening but also satisfying to discover 21
that some representations of the past still remain for future 22
generations to admire. Indeed, Hotel Lakeside stands as a bridge 23
connecting the present and the past, and such a venerable and 24
distinguished landmark is deserving of high praise; therefore be it 25
