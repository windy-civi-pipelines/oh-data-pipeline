that form: 213

section 2919.12 of the Revised Code. The failure of a physician 248
to satisfy the conditions of division (B) of this section prior 249

as described in division (G) of this section; 253

H. B. No. 347 Page 10
As Introduced

in relation to an elective abortion until the informed consent 257
requirements are met in accordance with this section. 258
(G)(1) Subject to divisions (G)(3) and (4) of this 259
section, any physician who performs or induces an abortion with 260
actual knowledge that the conditions specified in division (B) 261

indifference as to whether those conditions have been satisfied 263
or who causes any person to sustain injury, death, or loss to 264
person or property as a result of negligent, reckless, or 265
intentional conduct is liable in statutory, compensatory, and 266
exemplary damages, court costs, and attorney's fees in a civil 267
action to any interested party. 268
(2)(a) In the event the claimant prevails in an action 269
brought under this section, the court shall award the following: 270
(i) Statutory damages in the amount of at least one 271
hundred thousand dollars for each claim brought by the 272
interested party in which the interested party prevailed; 273

of the Revised Code; 275
(iii) Punitive or exemplary damages authorized under 276
section 2315.21 of the Revised Code; 277
(iv) Court costs and attorney's fees. 278
(b) The court additionally may enter any injunctive or 279
other equitable relief that it considers appropriate. 280

H. B. No. 347 Page 11

contrary, no court shall award costs or attorney's fees to a 282
defendant in an action brought under this section. 283
(3) The following shall be affirmative defenses in a civil 284
action authorized under this section: 285
(a) The physician performed or induced the abortion under 286
the circumstances described in division (C) of this section. 287
(b) The physician made an objectively reasonable and good 288
faith effort to satisfy the conditions specified in division (B) 289
of this section. 290
(c) For an action brought in relation to a drug-induced 291
abortion in which informed consent requirements were not met, 292
the defendant reasonably believed, after conducting a reasonable 293
investigation, that the drug was intended for lawful, on-label 294
use rather than for the purpose of inducing an abortion. 295
(4) The following are not affirmative defenses in a civil 296
action authorized under this section: 297
(a) Ignorance or mistake of the law; 298
(b) A defendant's belief that the requirements under this 299
section are or were unconstitutional; 300
(c) A defendant's reliance on any state or federal court 301
decision that is not binding on the court in which the action 302
has been brought; 303
(d) Non-mutual issue preclusion or non-mutual claim 304
preclusion; 305
(e) If the informed consent requirements have not been 306
met, the voluntary consent of the unborn child's mother to the 307
elective abortion; 308

H. B. No. 347 Page 12
As Introduced
(f) Any claim that the enforcement of this chapter or the 309
imposition of civil liability against the defendant violates a 310
third party's constitutional rights. 311
(5) Nothing in this section shall preclude an interested 312
party from either of the following: 313
(a) Bringing any additional civil action or claim arising 314
out of the circumstances that are the basis for an action under 315
this section; 316
(b) Being awarded statutory damages pursuant to additional 317
civil actions or claims. 318
(6) Nothing in this section shall be construed to impose 319
liability on any speech or conduct protected by the first 320
amendment to the United States Constitution, as made applicable 321
to the states through interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment 322
to the United States Constitution by the supreme court of the 323
United States, or by the Ohio Constitution. 324
(7) A pregnant woman on whom an elective abortion is 325
performed or induced or attempted to be performed or induced is 326
not liable under this section. 327
(H) Any provision of this section held to be invalid or 328
unenforceable by its terms, or as applied to any person or 329
circumstance held invalid or unenforceable by its terms, shall 330
be construed so as to give it the maximum effect permitted by 331
law. If such holding wholly invalidates or renders the provision 332
unenforceable, the provision is severable and does not affect 333
the remainder of the provisions of this section or how the 334
remainder of the provisions in this section apply to any other 335
person not similarly situated or to other, dissimilar 336
circumstances. 337

of the Revised Code. 341
(J) The state medical board may adopt rules in accordance 342
with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code to specify any adverse 343
physical or psychological condition arising from the performance 344
or inducement of an abortion for the purpose of the definition 345
of complications as set forth in division (A)(2) of this 346
section. 347
