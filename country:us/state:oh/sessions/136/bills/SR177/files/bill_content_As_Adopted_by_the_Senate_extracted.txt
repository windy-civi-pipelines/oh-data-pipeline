have been involved with its operations are to be applauded on their 21
tremendous efforts. Indeed, this venture convincingly demonstrates how 22
very much can be accomplished by a group of conscientious people with 23
clear objectives and firm resolve, and it is through the work of 24
citizens such as these that Ohio continues to be a pleasant place in 25
which to live; therefore be it 26
