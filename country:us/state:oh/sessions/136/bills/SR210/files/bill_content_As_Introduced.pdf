Honoring Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge 136 on its
One Hundred Twenty-fifth Anniversary.
WHEREAS, The members of the Senate of the 136th General Assembly 1
of Ohio are pleased to congratulate Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge 136 2
on the auspicious occasion of its One Hundredth Twenty-fifth 3
Anniversary; and 4
WHEREAS, Celebration of this prestigious milestone is, indeed, a 5
fitting tribute to Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge 136. Established in 6
1900, the organization was created to support the Croat community that 7
was emerging in the area, and over the past twelve and a half decades, 8
it has experienced tremendous growth and success. Clearly, this pillar 9
of the community is deserving of high praise, and its accomplishments 10
are a justifiable source of pride and an excellent reflection not only 11
on the group itself but also on all those who sustain it; and 12
WHEREAS, Since its inception, Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge 136 13
has enhanced the quality of life for generations of families in the 14
Lorain Croatian community, and it has become the source of numerous 15
beneficial initiatives. Its generous contributions have earned it the 16
appreciation and respect of countless thankful residents, and we are 17
certain that as this exemplary institution maintains its unfaltering 18
dedication to service, it will continue in the tradition of excellence 19
that has become its hallmark; and 20
WHEREAS, All those associated with Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge 21
136 are to be commended for their foresight, dedication, and selfless 22
donations of time, energy, and ability far beyond what was required or 23
expected. These fine people have gained the esteem and admiration of 24
many and have set an example of concerned and responsible citizenship 25
worthy of emulation; therefore be it 26
