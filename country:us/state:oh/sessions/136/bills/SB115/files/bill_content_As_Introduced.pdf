qualification that contain the information that it considers 1236

refusal by the division to register securities. 1252
(E) If it appears to the division that substantially the 1253
only consideration to be paid for any of the securities to be 1254
qualified is to be intangible property of doubtful value, the 1255
division may require that the securities be delivered in escrow 1256
to a bank in this state under the terms that the division may 1257
reasonably prescribe or require to prevent a deceitful 1258
misrepresentation or sale of the securities; that the securities 1259
be subordinated in favor of those sold for sound value until 1260
they have a value bearing a reasonable relation to the value of 1261
those sold for sound value; or that a legend of warning 1262
specifying the considerations paid or to be paid for the 1263
securities be stamped or printed on all advertisements, 1264
circulars, pamphlets, or subscription blanks used in connection 1265
with the sale of any securities of the same issuer; or it may 1266
impose a combination of any two or more of these requirements. 1267

(G)(1) The division, at any time, as a prerequisite to 1271
qualification, may make an examination of the issuer of 1272
securities sought to be qualified. The applicant for 1273
qualification of any securities may be required by the division 1274
to advance sufficient funds to pay all or any part of the actual 1275
expenses of that examination, an itemized statement of which 1276
shall be furnished the applicant. 1277
(2) If (2)(a) Subject to division (G)(2)(b) of this 1278
section, if the division finds that the business of the issuer 1279
is not fraudulently conducted, that the proposed offer or 1280
disposal of securities is not on grossly unfair terms, that the 1281
plan of issuance and sale of the securities referred to in the 1282
proposed offer or disposal would not defraud or deceive, or tend 1283
to defraud or deceive, purchasers, and that division (B)(10) of 1284
this section applies and has been complied with, the division 1285
shall notify the applicant of its findings, and, upon payment of 1286
a registration fee of one-tenth of one per cent of the aggregate 1287
price at which the securities are to be sold to the public in 1288
this state, which fee, however, shall in no case be less than 1289
one hundred or more than one thousand dollars, the division 1290
shall register the qualification of the securities. 1291
(b) To eliminate and preclude excessive and duplicative 1292
rules and regulations that stand in the way of job creation, the 1293
division shall not condition or delay any registration due to 1294
any noncompliance or partial compliance with any requirement, 1295
formal or informal rule, or principle of law or policy of the 1296
division that is inconsistent with, or more stringent or 1297
burdensome than, federal law and rule require. 1298

qualification or in refusing to do so. Subsequent to any such 1302
action by the division, the person who filed the application may 1303
file with the consent of the division one or more amendments to 1304
it that shall become effective upon the making by the division 1305
of the findings enumerated in division (G) of this section; the 1306
giving of notice of those findings to the applicant by the 1307
division; and the payment by the applicant of the additional fee 1308
that would have been payable had the application, as it 1309
previously became effective, contained the amendment. 1310
(I) When any securities have been qualified and the fees 1311
for the qualification have been paid as provided in this 1312
section, any licensed dealer subsequently may sell the 1313
securities under the qualification, so long as the qualification 1314
remains in full force, and any dealer of that nature that 1315
desires may file with the division a written notice of intention 1316
to sell the securities or any designated portion of them. For 1317
that filing, no fee need be paid. 1318

commission, if all of the following conditions are satisfied: 1363
(1) No stop order is in effect, no proceeding is pending 1364

Revised Code; 1367
(2) The registration statement has been on file with the 1368
division for at least fifteen days or for such shorter period as 1369
the division by rule or otherwise permits; provided, that if the 1370
registration statement is not filed with the division within 1371
five days of the initial filing with the securities and exchange 1372

(4) The division has received a registration fee of one- 1382

statement became effective, or when the offering may otherwise 1389
be commenced in accordance with the rules, regulations, or 1390
orders of the securities and exchange commission, and of the 1391
contents of the price amendment, if any, and shall promptly file 1392
the price amendment. 1393

required copies of the price amendment, the division may enter a 1401
provisional stop order retroactively denying effectiveness to 1402

there is compliance with this division, provided the division 1404
promptly notifies the issuer or its representative by telephone, 1405
and promptly confirms by letter when it notifies by telephone, 1406
of the entry of the order. If the issuer or its representative 1407

notice and price amendment filing, the stop order is void as of 1409
the time of its entry. The division may by rule or otherwise 1410
waive either or both of the conditions specified in divisions 1411

commenced in accordance with the rules, regulations, or orders 1414
of the securities and exchange commission, before all of the 1415
conditions specified in divisions (C) and (D) of this section 1416

federal registration statement is expected to become effective, 1421
or when the offering may otherwise be commenced in accordance 1422
with the rules, regulations, or orders of the securities and 1423
exchange commission, the division shall promptly advise the 1424
issuer or its representative by telephone, at the issuer's 1425
expense, whether all of the conditions have been satisfied or 1426
whether the division then contemplates the institution of a 1427
proceeding under section 1707.13 or 1707.23 of the Revised Code, 1428
but such advice does not preclude the institution of such a 1429
proceeding at any time. 1430
(E) To eliminate and preclude excessive and duplicative 1431
rules and regulations that stand in the way of job creation, the 1432
division shall not condition or delay any registration under 1433
this section, or enter any stop order respecting any such 1434
registration, due to any noncompliance or partial compliance 1435
with any requirement, formal or informal rule, or principle of 1436
law or policy of the division that is inconsistent with, or more 1437
stringent or burdensome than, federal law and rule require. 1438

concerning a registration under this section. 1440
(G) The division shall not issue any written guidance or 1441
interpretation, policy statement, advisory opinion, standard, or 1442
similar statement concerning registration by coordination, other 1443

1707.06, 1707.08, 1707.09, or 1707.091 of the Revised Code, or 1483
division (A) of this section, a notice filing shall be submitted 1484
to the division together with a consent to service of process 1485
pursuant to section 1707.11 of the Revised Code and a filing fee 1486

section shall consist of any document filed with the securities 1489
and exchange commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, 1490
together with annual or periodic reports of the value of the 1491
securities sold or offered to be sold to persons located in this 1492
state. 1493
(D) A notice filing submitted under this section shall be 1494
effective for thirteen months. 1495
Sec. 1707.13. (A) The division of securities may suspend 1496
the registration by description or by qualification of any 1497
securities, or the right of any dealers or of the issuer, or of 1498
both, to buy, sell, or deal in any particular security whether 1499
it is registered, qualified, or exempt or even though 1500
transactions in it are registered or exempt, if the division 1501
finds that the issuer has violated sections 1707.01 to 1707.50, 1502
inclusive, of the Revised Code, or any lawful order or 1503
requirement of the division, has fraudulently conducted its 1504
business, or has been engaged in or is engaged or about to 1505
engage in deceptive or fraudulent acts, practices, or 1506
transactions; that such security is being disposed of or 1507

purchased on grossly unfair terms, in such manner as to deceive 1508
or defraud or as to tend to deceive or defraud purchasers or 1509
sellers, or in disregard of the lawful rules and regulations of 1510
the division applicable to such security or to transactions 1511
therein; or, in the case of securities being sold under a 1512
registration or qualification, that the issuer is insolvent. 1513
(B) To eliminate and preclude excessive and duplicative 1514
rules and regulations that stand in the way of job creation, the 1515
division shall not suspend, revoke, condition, or delay any 1516
registration of securities, or enter any stop order respecting 1517
any registration of securities due to noncompliance or partial 1518
compliance with any requirement, formal or informal rule, or 1519
principle of law or policy of the division that is inconsistent 1520
with, or more stringent or burdensome than, federal law and rule 1521
require. 1522
(C) Notice of such suspension shall be mailed by the 1523
division to the issuer and to all licensed dealers concerned. 1524
Such notice shall specify the particular security whose 1525
registration is being suspended and shall set a date, not more 1526
than ten days later than the date of the order of suspension, 1527
for a hearing on the continuation or revocation of such 1528
suspension. For good cause the division may continue such 1529
hearing on application of any interested party. In conducting 1530
such hearing the division shall have all the authority and 1531
powers set forth in section 1707.23 of the Revised Code. 1532
Following such hearing the division shall either confirm or 1533
revoke such suspension. No such suspension shall invalidate any 1534
sale of securities made prior thereto; and the rights of persons 1535
defrauded by any sale shall in no wise be impaired. 1536
(D) If the issuer of a security refuses to permit an 1537

examination to be made by the division of its books, records, 1538
and property, or refuses to furnish the division any information 1539
which it may lawfully require under sections 1707.01 to 1707.50, 1540
inclusive, of the Revised Code, such refusal is a sufficient 1541
ground for the division to suspend the registration by 1542
description or by qualification of such security, or the right 1543
of any dealers or of the issuer, or of both, to buy, sell, or 1544
deal in such security. 1545
If any interested party desires an investigation at a 1546
place other than the office of the division, such person may be 1547
required by the division to advance sufficient funds to pay the 1548
actual expenses of such investigation. 1549
Whenever the division determines, upon hearing, that any 1550
application for qualification was made, or that any securities 1551
or any transaction was registered by description, by a person 1552
who knew that untrue statements were contained in such 1553
application or description, the division may proceed under 1554
sections 1707.19, 1707.23, and 1707.44 of the Revised Code, or 1555
any of them, against the person who filed such application or 1556
such registration by description. 1557
Sec. 1707.23. (A) Whenever it appears to the division of 1558

any person has engaged in, is engaged in, or is about to engage 1560
in any practice declared to be illegal or prohibited by this 1561
chapter or rules adopted under this chapter by the division, or 1562
defined as fraudulent in this chapter or rules adopted under 1563
this chapter by the division, or any other deceptive scheme or 1564
practice in connection with the sale of securities, or acting as 1565

investors, the division may do any of the following: 1572
(A) (1) Require any person to file with it, on such forms 1573
as it prescribes, an original or additional statement or report 1574
in writing, under oath or otherwise, as to any facts or 1575

investment adviser, investment adviser representative, bureau of 1579

portal operator, and any of their agents, employees, partners, 1588
officers, directors, members, or shareholders, wherever located, 1589
under oath; and examine and produce records, books, documents, 1590
accounts, and papers as the division deems material or relevant 1591
to the inquiry; 1592
(C) (3) Require the attendance of witnesses, and the 1593
production of books, records, and papers, as are required either 1594
by the division or by any party to a hearing before the 1595
division, and for that purpose issue a subpoena for any witness, 1596
or a subpoena duces tecum to compel the production of any books, 1597

service or by certified mail, return receipt requested. If the 1599
subpoena is returned because of inability to deliver, or if no 1600
return is received within thirty days of the date of mailing, 1601
the subpoena may be served by ordinary mail. If no return of 1602
ordinary mail is received within thirty days after the date of 1603
mailing, service shall be deemed to have been made. If the 1604
subpoena is returned because of inability to deliver, the 1605
division may designate a person or persons to effect either 1606
personal or residence service upon the witness. The person 1607
designated to effect personal or residence service under this 1608
division may be the sheriff of the county in which the witness 1609
resides or may be found or any other duly designated person. The 1610
fees and mileage of the person serving the subpoena shall be the 1611
same as those allowed by the courts of common pleas in criminal 1612
cases, and shall be paid from the funds of the division. Fees 1613
and mileage for the witness shall be determined under section 1614
119.094 of the Revised Code, and shall be paid from the funds of 1615
the division upon request of the witness following the hearing. 1616
(D) (4) Initiate criminal proceedings under section 1617
1707.042 or 1707.44 of the Revised Code or rules adopted under 1618
those sections by the division by laying before the prosecuting 1619
attorney of the proper county any evidence of criminality which 1620
comes to its knowledge; and in the event of the neglect or 1621
refusal of the prosecuting attorney to prosecute such 1622
violations, or at the request of the prosecuting attorney, the 1623
division shall submit the evidence to the attorney general, who 1624
may proceed in the prosecution with all the rights, privileges, 1625
and powers conferred by law on prosecuting attorneys, including 1626
the power to appear before grand juries and to interrogate 1627
witnesses before such grand juries. 1628

or require any investment advisers immediately to furnish to the 1632
division copies of brochures, advertisements, publications, 1633
analyses, reports, or other writings that they publish or 1634
distribute; 1635
(F) (6) Require any dealers to mail to the division, prior 1636

(G) (7) Issue and cause to be served by certified mail 1641
upon all persons affected an order requiring the person or 1642
persons to cease and desist from the acts or practices appearing 1643

rules adopted under this chapter by the division. The order 1645
shall state specifically the section or sections of this chapter 1646
or the rule or rules adopted under this chapter by the division 1647
that appear to the division to have been violated and the facts 1648
constituting the violation. If after the issuance of the order 1649
it appears to the division that any person or persons affected 1650
by the order have engaged in any act or practice from which the 1651
person or persons shall have been required, by the order, to 1652
cease and desist, the director of commerce may apply to the 1653
court of common pleas of any county for, and upon proof of the 1654
validity of the order of the division, the delivery of the order 1655
to the person or persons affected, and of the illegality and the 1656
continuation of the acts or practices that are the subject of 1657
the order, the court may grant an injunction implementing the 1658

information is sought would violate this chapter if the 1664
activities had occurred in this state. 1665
(I) (9) The remedies provided by this section are 1666
cumulative and concurrent with any other remedy provided in this 1667
chapter, and the exercise of one remedy does not preclude or 1668
require the exercise of any other remedy. 1669
(B) To eliminate and preclude excessive and duplicative 1670
rules and regulations that stand in the way of job creation, the 1671
division shall not suspend, revoke, condition, or delay any 1672
registration of securities, or enter any stop order respecting 1673
any registration of securities due to any noncompliance or 1674
partial compliance with any requirement, formal or informal 1675
rule, or principle of law or policy of the division that is 1676
inconsistent with, or more stringent or burdensome than, federal 1677
law and rule require. 1678
Sec. 1707.39. When any securities have been sold without 1679
compliance with sections 1707.01 to 1707.50 of the Revised Code, 1680
or any former law in force at the time of such sale, any 1681
interested person may apply in writing to the division of 1682
securities for the qualification of such securities under such 1683
sections. If it appears to the division that no person has been 1684
defrauded, prejudiced, or damaged by such noncompliance or sale 1685
and that no person will be defrauded, prejudiced, or damaged by 1686
such qualification, the division may permit such securities to 1687
be so qualified upon the payment of a fee of one hundred dollars 1688
plus a fee of one-fifth of one per cent of the aggregate price 1689

applicant to advance sufficient funds to pay the actual expenses 1693
of an examination or investigation by the division, whether to 1694
be conducted in this state or outside this state. An itemized 1695
statement of such expenses shall be furnished to the applicant. 1696
Such qualification shall estop the division from 1697
proceeding under division (D)(A)(4) of section 1707.23 of the 1698
Revised Code against anyone who has violated division (C)(1) of 1699
section 1707.44 of the Revised Code for acts within the scope of 1700
