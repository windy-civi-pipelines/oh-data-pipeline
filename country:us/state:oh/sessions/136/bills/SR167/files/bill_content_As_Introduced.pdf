Honoring St. Mary’s Byzantine Catholic Church on its
Quasquicentennial.
WHEREAS, The members of the Senate of the 136th General Assembly 1
of Ohio are pleased to pay tribute to St. Mary’s Byzantine Catholic 2
Church on the auspicious occasion of its One Hundred Twenty-fifth 3
Anniversary; and 4
WHEREAS, Recognition of this significant milestone is a fitting 5
tribute to St. Mary’s Byzantine Catholic Church, for over the past one 6
hundred twenty-five years, it has attained a praiseworthy record of 7
service. The achievements of this fine house of worship are a 8
justifiable source of pride and an excellent reflection not only on 9
the church itself but also on its devoted pastor, the Reverend John 10
Welch, on its members, and on the Greater Youngstown community; and 11
WHEREAS, The first and mother church for all other Byzantine 12
Catholic churches in Mahoning, Trumbull, Columbiana, and Mercer 13
counties, St. Mary’s Byzantine Catholic Church has enhanced the 14
quality of life in the area since its inception, and its generous 15
contributions have earned it the gratitude and respect of the many 16
citizens it has so capably served. We are certain that in the years to 17
come, the church will maintain the tradition of spiritual 18
enlightenment that has long been its hallmark; and 19
WHEREAS, The members of the St. Mary’s Byzantine Catholic Church 20
have long been actively involved in, and concerned about, the events 21
in their community, and this celebration offers them a unique 22
opportunity to share their memories and to reflect on the benefits of 23
life in their close-knit community. The congregation can, indeed, be 24
proud of their church, for they have built on the best traditions of 25
the past to ensure a peaceful and robust future; therefore be it 26
