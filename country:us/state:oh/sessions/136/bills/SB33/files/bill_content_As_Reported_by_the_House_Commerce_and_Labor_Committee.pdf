contracting public authority upon completion of the public 113
improvement and prior to final payment therefor an affidavit 114
stating that the contractor or subcontractor has fully complied 115
with sections 4115.03 to 4115.16 of the Revised Code. 116
Sec. 4123.54. (A) Except as otherwise provided in this 117
division or divisions (I) and (K) of this section, every 118
employee, who is injured or who contracts an occupational 119

course of employment, wherever the injury has occurred or 122
occupational disease has been contracted, is entitled to receive 123
the compensation for loss sustained on account of the injury, 124
occupational disease, or death, and the medical, nurse, and 125
hospital services and medicines, and the amount of funeral 126
expenses in case of death, as are provided by this chapter. The 127
compensation and benefits shall be provided, as applicable, 128
directly from the employee's self-insuring employer as provided 129
in section 4123.35 of the Revised Code or from the state 130
insurance fund. An employee or dependent is not entitled to 131
receive compensation or benefits under this division if the 132
employee's injury or occupational disease is either of the 133
following: 134
(1) Purposely self-inflicted; 135
(2) Caused by the employee being intoxicated, under the 136

S. B. No. 33 Page 6

influence of a controlled substance not prescribed by a 137
physician, certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse specialist, 138
or certified nurse practitioner, or under the influence of 139
marihuana if being intoxicated, under the influence of a 140
controlled substance not prescribed by a physician, certified 141
nurse-midwife, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse 142
practitioner, or under the influence of marihuana was the 143
proximate cause of the injury. 144
(B) For the purpose of this section, provided that an 145
employer has posted written notice to employees that the results 146
of, or the employee's refusal to submit to, any chemical test 147
described under this division may affect the employee's 148
eligibility for compensation and benefits pursuant to this 149
chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code, there is a 150
rebuttable presumption that an employee is intoxicated, under 151
the influence of a controlled substance not prescribed by the 152
employee's physician, certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse 153
specialist, or certified nurse practitioner, or under the 154
influence of marihuana and that being intoxicated, under the 155
influence of a controlled substance not prescribed by the 156
employee's physician, certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse 157

(1) When any one or more of the following is true: 161
(a) The employee, through a qualifying chemical test 162
administered within eight hours of an injury, is determined to 163
have an alcohol concentration level equal to or in excess of the 164
levels established in divisions (A)(1)(b) to (i) of section 165
4511.19 of the Revised Code. 166

S. B. No. 33 Page 7
As Reported by the House Commerce and Labor Committee
(b) The employee, through a qualifying chemical test 167
administered within thirty-two hours of an injury, is determined 168
to have a controlled substance not prescribed by the employee's 169
physician, certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse specialist, 170
or certified nurse practitioner or marihuana in the employee's 171
system at a level equal to or in excess of the cutoff 172
concentration level for the particular substance as provided in 173
section 40.87 of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 49 174
C.F.R. 40.87, as amended. 175
(c) The employee, through a qualifying chemical test 176
administered within thirty-two hours of an injury, is determined 177
to have barbiturates, benzodiazepines, or methadone in the 178
employee's system that tests above levels established by 179
laboratories certified by the United States department of health 180
and human services. 181
(2) When the employee refuses to submit to a requested 182
chemical test, on the condition that that employee is or was 183
given notice that the refusal to submit to any chemical test 184
described in division (B)(1) of this section may affect the 185
employee's eligibility for compensation and benefits under this 186
chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code. 187
(C)(1) For purposes of division (B) of this section, a 188
chemical test is a qualifying chemical test if it is 189
administered to an employee after an injury under at least one 190
of the following conditions: 191
(a) When the employee's employer had reasonable cause to 192
suspect that the employee may be intoxicated, under the 193
influence of a controlled substance not prescribed by the 194
employee's physician, certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse 195
specialist, or certified nurse practitioner, or under the 196

S. B. No. 33 Page 8

influence of marihuana; 197

4511.191 of the Revised Code, and not at the request of the 199
employee's employer; 200
(c) At the request of a licensed physician, certified 201
nurse-midwife, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse 202
practitioner who is not employed by the employee's employer, and 203
not at the request of the employee's employer. 204
(2) As used in division (C)(1)(a) of this section, 205
"reasonable cause" means, but is not limited to, evidence that 206
an employee is or was using alcohol, a controlled substance, or 207
marihuana drawn from specific, objective facts and reasonable 208
inferences drawn from these facts in light of experience and 209
training. These facts and inferences may be based on, but are 210
not limited to, any of the following: 211
(a) Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of 212
use, possession, or distribution of alcohol, a controlled 213
substance, or marihuana, or of the physical symptoms of being 214
under the influence of alcohol, a controlled substance, or 215

changes in affect; or dynamic mood swings; 218
(b) A pattern of abnormal conduct, erratic or aberrant 219
behavior, or deteriorating work performance such as frequent 220
absenteeism, excessive tardiness, or recurrent accidents, that 221
appears to be related to the use of alcohol, a controlled 222
substance, or marihuana, and does not appear to be attributable 223
to other factors; 224
(c) The identification of an employee as the focus of a 225

S. B. No. 33 Page 9
As Reported by the House Commerce and Labor Committee
criminal investigation into unauthorized possession, use, or 226
trafficking of a controlled substance or marihuana; 227
(d) A report of use of alcohol, a controlled substance, or 228
marihuana provided by a reliable and credible source; 229
(e) Repeated or flagrant violations of the safety or work 230
rules of the employee's employer, that are determined by the 231
employee's supervisor to pose a substantial risk of physical 232
injury or property damage and that appear to be related to the 233
use of alcohol, a controlled substance, or marihuana and that do 234
not appear attributable to other factors. 235
(D) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect 236
the rights of an employer to test employees for alcohol or 237
controlled substance abuse. 238
(E) For the purpose of this section, laboratories 239
certified by the United States department of health and human 240
services or laboratories that meet or exceed the standards of 241
that department for laboratory certification shall be used for 242
processing the test results of a qualifying chemical test. 243
(F) The written notice required by division (B) of this 244
section shall be the same size or larger than the proof of 245
workers' compensation coverage furnished by the bureau of 246
workers' compensation and shall be posted by the employer in the 247
same location as the proof of workers' compensation coverage or 248
the certificate of self-insurance. An employer may post the 249
written notice required by division (B) of this section on the 250
internet in a manner that is accessible to the employer's 251
employees. 252
(G) If a condition that pre-existed an injury is 253
substantially aggravated by the injury, and that substantial 254

S. B. No. 33 Page 10
As Reported by the House Commerce and Labor Committee
aggravation is documented by objective diagnostic findings, 255
objective clinical findings, or objective test results, no 256
compensation or benefits are payable because of the pre-existing 257
condition once that condition has returned to a level that would 258
have existed without the injury. 259
(H)(1) Whenever, with respect to an employee of an 260
employer who is subject to and has complied with this chapter, 261
there is possibility of conflict with respect to the application 262
of workers' compensation laws because the contract of employment 263
is entered into and all or some portion of the work is or is to 264
be performed in a state or states other than Ohio, the employer 265
and the employee may agree to be bound by the laws of this state 266
or by the laws of some other state in which all or some portion 267
of the work of the employee is to be performed. The agreement 268
shall be in writing and shall be filed with the bureau of 269
workers' compensation within ten days after it is executed and 270
shall remain in force until terminated or modified by agreement 271
of the parties similarly filed. If the agreement is to be bound 272
by the laws of this state and the employer has complied with 273
this chapter, then the employee is entitled to compensation and 274
benefits regardless of where the injury occurs or the disease is 275
contracted and the rights of the employee and the employee's 276
dependents under the laws of this state are the exclusive remedy 277
against the employer on account of injury, disease, or death in 278
the course of and arising out of the employee's employment. If 279
the agreement is to be bound by the laws of another state and 280
the employer has complied with the laws of that state, the 281
rights of the employee and the employee's dependents under the 282
laws of that state are the exclusive remedy against the employer 283
on account of injury, disease, or death in the course of and 284
arising out of the employee's employment without regard to the 285

S. B. No. 33 Page 11
As Reported by the House Commerce and Labor Committee
place where the injury was sustained or the disease contracted. 286
If an employer and an employee enter into an agreement under 287
this division, the fact that the employer and the employee 288
entered into that agreement shall not be construed to change the 289
status of an employee whose continued employment is subject to 290
the will of the employer or the employee, unless the agreement 291
contains a provision that expressly changes that status. 292
(2) If an employee or the employee's dependents receive an 293
award of compensation or benefits under this chapter or Chapter 294
4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for the same injury, 295
occupational disease, or death for which the employee or the 296
employee's dependents previously pursued or otherwise elected to 297
accept workers' compensation benefits and received a decision on 298
the merits as defined in section 4123.542 of the Revised Code 299
under the laws of another state or recovered damages under the 300
laws of another state, the claim shall be disallowed and the 301
administrator or any self-insuring employer, by any lawful 302
means, may collect from the employee or the employee's 303
dependents any of the following: 304
(a) The amount of compensation or benefits paid to or on 305
behalf of the employee or the employee's dependents by the 306
administrator or a self-insuring employer pursuant to this 307
chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code 308
for that award; 309
(b) Any interest, attorney's fees, and costs the 310
administrator or the self-insuring employer incurs in collecting 311
that payment. 312
(3) If an employee or the employee's dependents receive an 313
award of compensation or benefits under this chapter or Chapter 314
4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code and subsequently 315

S. B. No. 33 Page 12
As Reported by the House Commerce and Labor Committee
pursue or otherwise elect to accept workers' compensation 316
benefits or damages under the laws of another state for the same 317
injury, occupational disease, or death the claim under this 318
chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code 319
shall be disallowed. The administrator or a self-insuring 320
employer, by any lawful means, may collect from the employee or 321
the employee's dependents or other-states' insurer any of the 322
following: 323
(a) The amount of compensation or benefits paid to or on 324
behalf of the employee or the employee's dependents by the 325
administrator or the self-insuring employer pursuant to this 326
chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code 327
for that award; 328
(b) Any interest, costs, and attorney's fees the 329
administrator or the self-insuring employer incurs in collecting 330
that payment; 331
(c) Any costs incurred by an employer in contesting or 332
responding to any claim filed by the employee or the employee's 333
dependents for the same injury, occupational disease, or death 334
that was filed after the original claim for which the employee 335
or the employee's dependents received a decision on the merits 336
as described in section 4123.542 of the Revised Code. 337
(4) If the employee's employer pays premiums into the 338
state insurance fund, the administrator shall not charge the 339
amount of compensation or benefits the administrator collects 340
pursuant to division (H)(2) or (3) of this section to the 341
employer's experience. If the administrator collects any costs 342
incurred by an employer in contesting or responding to any claim 343
pursuant to division (H)(2) or (3) of this section, the 344
administrator shall forward the amount collected to that 345

S. B. No. 33 Page 13
As Reported by the House Commerce and Labor Committee
employer. If the employee's employer is a self-insuring 346
employer, the self-insuring employer shall deduct the amount of 347
compensation or benefits the self-insuring employer collects 348
pursuant to this division from the paid compensation the self- 349
insuring employer reports to the administrator under division 350
(L) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code. 351
(5) If an employee is a resident of a state other than 352
this state and is insured under the workers' compensation law or 353
similar laws of a state other than this state, the employee and 354
the employee's dependents are not entitled to receive 355
compensation or benefits under this chapter, on account of 356
injury, disease, or death arising out of or in the course of 357
employment while temporarily within this state, and the rights 358
of the employee and the employee's dependents under the laws of 359
the other state are the exclusive remedy against the employer on 360
account of the injury, disease, or death. 361
(6) An employee, or the dependent of an employee, who 362
elects to receive compensation and benefits under this chapter 363
or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for a 364
claim may not receive compensation and benefits under the 365
workers' compensation laws of any state other than this state 366
for that same claim. For each claim submitted by or on behalf of 367
an employee, the administrator or, if the employee is employed 368
by a self-insuring employer, the self-insuring employer, shall 369
request the employee or the employee's dependent to sign an 370
election that affirms the employee's or employee's dependent's 371
acceptance of electing to receive compensation and benefits 372
under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the 373
Revised Code for that claim that also affirmatively waives and 374
releases the employee's or the employee's dependent's right to 375
file for and receive compensation and benefits under the laws of 376

S. B. No. 33 Page 14
As Reported by the House Commerce and Labor Committee
any state other than this state for that claim. The employee or 377
employee's dependent shall sign the election form within twenty- 378
eight days after the administrator or self-insuring employer 379
submits the request or the administrator or self-insuring 380
employer shall dismiss that claim. 381
In the event a workers' compensation claim has been filed 382
in another jurisdiction on behalf of an employee or the 383
dependents of an employee, and the employee or dependents 384
subsequently elect to receive compensation, benefits, or both 385
under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the 386
Revised Code, the employee or dependent shall withdraw or refuse 387
acceptance of the workers' compensation claim filed in the other 388
jurisdiction in order to pursue compensation or benefits under 389
the laws of this state. If the employee or dependents were 390
awarded workers' compensation benefits or had recovered damages 391
under the laws of the other state, any compensation and benefits 392
awarded under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of 393
the Revised Code shall be paid only to the extent to which those 394
payments exceed the amounts paid under the laws of the other 395
state. If the employee or dependent fails to withdraw or to 396
refuse acceptance of the workers' compensation claim in the 397
other jurisdiction within twenty-eight days after a request made 398
by the administrator or a self-insuring employer, the 399
administrator or self-insuring employer shall dismiss the 400
employee's or employee's dependents' claim made in this state. 401
(I) If an employee who is covered under the federal 402
"Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act," 98 Stat. 1639, 403
33 U.S.C. 901 et seq., is injured or contracts an occupational 404
disease or dies as a result of an injury or occupational 405
disease, and if that employee's or that employee's dependents' 406
claim for compensation or benefits for that injury, occupational 407

S. B. No. 33 Page 15
As Reported by the House Commerce and Labor Committee
disease, or death is subject to the jurisdiction of that act, 408
the employee or the employee's dependents are not entitled to 409
apply for and shall not receive compensation or benefits under 410
this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code. The rights 411
of such an employee and the employee's dependents under the 412
federal "Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act," 98 413
Stat. 1639, 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq., are the exclusive remedy 414
against the employer for that injury, occupational disease, or 415
death. 416
(J) Compensation or benefits are not payable to a claimant 417
or a dependent during the period of confinement of the claimant 418
or dependent in any state or federal correctional institution, 419
or in any county jail in lieu of incarceration in a state or 420
federal correctional institution, whether in this or any other 421
state for conviction of violation of any state or federal 422
criminal law. 423
(K) An employer, upon the approval of the administrator, 424
may provide for workers' compensation coverage for the 425
employer's employees who are professional athletes and coaches 426
by submitting to the administrator proof of coverage under a 427
league policy issued under the laws of another state under 428
either of the following circumstances: 429
(1) The employer administers the payroll and workers' 430
compensation insurance for a professional sports team subject to 431
a collective bargaining agreement, and the collective bargaining 432
agreement provides for the uniform administration of workers' 433
compensation benefits and compensation for professional 434
athletes. 435
