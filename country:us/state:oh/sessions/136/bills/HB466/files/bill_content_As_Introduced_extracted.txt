limitation will be insufficient to provide an adequate amount 452
for the necessary requirements of such district within the 453
county, and that it is necessary to levy a tax in excess of such 454
limitation in order to provide the board of health with 455
sufficient funds to carry out such health program. Such 456
resolution shall be filed with the board of elections not later 457
than four p.m. of the ninetieth day before the day of election. 458
Such resolution shall specify the amount of increase in 459
rate which it is necessary to levy and the number of years 460

be for a longer period than ten years. 462
The resolution shall conform to section 5705.191 of the 463
Revised Code and be certified and submitted in the manner 464
provided in section 5705.25 of the Revised Code, provided that 465
the proposal shall be placed on the ballot at the next primary 466
or general election occurring more than ninety days after the 467
