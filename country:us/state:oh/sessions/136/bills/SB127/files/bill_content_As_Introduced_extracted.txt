S. B. No. 127 Page 63
As Introduced
this chapter requiring sponsors of community schools to report 1793
data or information to the department of education and 1794
workforce. 1795
(2) The entity is not rated as "ineffective" under 1796
division (B)(6) of this section. 1797
(3) Except as set forth in sections 3314.021 and 3314.027 1798
of the Revised Code, the entity has received approval from and 1799
entered into an agreement with the department pursuant to 1800
section 3314.015 of the Revised Code. 1801
(B)(1) The department shall develop and implement an 1802
evaluation system that annually rates and assigns an overall 1803
rating to each entity that sponsors a community school. The 1804
department, not later than the first day of February of each 1805
year, shall post on the department's web site the framework for 1806
the evaluation system, including technical documentation that 1807
the department intends to use to rate sponsors for the next 1808
school year. The department shall solicit public comment on the 1809
evaluation system for thirty consecutive days. Not later than 1810
the first day of April of each year, the department shall 1811
compile and post on the department's web site all public 1812
comments that were received during the public comment period. 1813

site by the fifteenth day of July of each school year. Any 1815
changes to the evaluation system after that date shall take 1816
effect the following year. The evaluation system shall be based 1817
on the following components: 1818
(a) Academic performance of students enrolled in community 1819
schools sponsored by the same entity. The academic performance 1820
component shall be derived from the performance measures 1821
prescribed for the state report cards under section 3302.03 or 1822

S. B. No. 127 Page 64
As Introduced
3314.017 of the Revised Code, and shall be based on the 1823
performance of the schools for the school year for which the 1824
evaluation is conducted. In addition to the academic performance 1825
for a specific school year, the academic performance component 1826
shall also include year-to-year changes in the overall sponsor 1827
portfolio. For a community school for which no graded 1828
performance measures are applicable or available, the department 1829
shall use nonreport card performance measures specified in the 1830
contract between the community school and the sponsor under 1831
division (A)(4) of section 3314.03 of the Revised Code. 1832
(b) Adherence by a sponsor to the quality practices 1833
prescribed by the department under division (B)(3) of this 1834
section. For a sponsor that was rated "effective" or "exemplary" 1835
on its most recent rating, the department may evaluate that 1836
sponsor's adherence to quality practices once over a period of 1837
three years. If the department elects to evaluate a sponsor once 1838
over a period of three years, the most recent rating for a 1839
sponsor's adherence to quality practices shall be used when 1840
determining an annual overall rating conducted under this 1841
section. 1842
(c) Compliance with all applicable laws and administrative 1843
rules by an entity that sponsors a community school. 1844
Under the evaluation system prescribed under division (B) 1845
(1) of this section, the department shall not assign an overall 1846
rating of "ineffective" or lower to an entity that sponsors a 1847
community school solely because that entity received no points 1848
on one of the components prescribed under that division. 1849
(2) In calculating an academic performance component, the 1850
department shall exclude all community schools that have been in 1851
operation for not more than two full school years and all 1852

students are children with disabilities receiving special 1855
education and related services in accordance with Chapter 3323. 1856
of the Revised Code. However, the academic performance of the 1857
community schools described in division (B)(2) of section 1858
3314.35 of the Revised Code in which a majority of the enrolled 1859
students are children with disabilities receiving special 1860
education and related services in accordance with Chapter 3323. 1861
of the Revised Code shall be reported, but shall not be used as 1862
a factor when determining a sponsoring entity's rating under 1863
this section. 1864
(3) The department, in consultation with entities that 1865
sponsor community schools, shall prescribe quality practices for 1866
community school sponsors and develop an instrument to measure 1867
adherence to those quality practices. The quality practices 1868
shall be based on standards developed by the national 1869
association of charter school authorizers or any other 1870
nationally organized community school organization. 1871
(4)(a) The department may permit peer review of a 1872
sponsor's adherence to the quality practices prescribed under 1873
division (B)(3) of this section. Peer reviewers shall be limited 1874
to individuals employed by sponsors rated "effective" or 1875
"exemplary" on the most recent ratings conducted under this 1876
section. 1877
(b) The department shall require individuals participating 1878
in peer review under division (B)(4)(a) of this section to 1879

(5) The director of education and workforce shall adopt 1886
rules in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code 1887
prescribing standards for measuring compliance with applicable 1888
laws and rules under division (B)(1)(c) of this section. 1889
(6) The department annually shall rate all entities that 1890
sponsor community schools as either "exemplary," "effective," 1891
"ineffective," or "poor," based on the components prescribed by 1892
division (B) of this section, where each component is weighted 1893
equally. A separate rating shall be given by the department for 1894
each component of the evaluation system. 1895
The department shall publish the ratings between the first 1896
day of October and the fifteenth day of November. 1897
Prior to the publication of the final ratings, the 1898
department shall designate and provide notice of a period of at 1899
least ten business days during which each sponsor may review the 1900
information used by the department to determine the sponsor's 1901
rating on the components prescribed by division (B)(1) of this 1902
section. If the sponsor believes there is an error in the 1903
department's evaluation, the sponsor may request adjustments to 1904
the rating of any of those components based on documentation 1905
previously submitted as part of an evaluation. The sponsor shall 1906
provide to the department any necessary evidence or information 1907
to support the requested adjustments. The department shall 1908
review the evidence and information, determine whether an 1909
adjustment is valid, and promptly notify the sponsor of its 1910
determination and reasons. If any adjustments to the data could 1911
result in a change to the rating on the applicable component or 1912

timelines, and data required for the evaluation system. The 1918
first training session shall occur not later than March 2, 2016. 1919
Beginning in 2018, the training shall be made available to each 1920
