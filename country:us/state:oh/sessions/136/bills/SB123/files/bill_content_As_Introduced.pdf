(B)(1) Upon request by any person and subject to division 554
(B)(8) of this section, all public records responsive to the 555
request shall be promptly prepared and made available for 556
inspection to the requester at all reasonable times during 557
regular business hours. Subject to division (B)(8) of this 558
section, upon request by any person, a public office or person 559
responsible for public records shall make copies of the 560
requested public record available to the requester at cost and 561
within a reasonable period of time. 562
When considering whether a state or local law enforcement 563
agency promptly prepared a video record for inspection or 564
provided a video record for production within a reasonable 565

period of time, in addition to any other factors, a court shall 566
consider the time required for a state or local law enforcement 567
agency to retrieve, download, review, redact, seek legal advice 568
regarding, and produce the video record. Notwithstanding Except 569
as specified in division (B)(11) of this section, 570
notwithstanding any other requirement set forth in Chapter 149. 571
of the Revised Code, a state or local law enforcement agency may 572
charge a requester the actual cost associated with preparing a 573
video record for inspection or production, not to exceed 574
seventy-five dollars per hour of video produced, nor seven 575
hundred fifty dollars total. As used in this division, "actual 576
cost," with respect to video records only, means all costs 577
incurred by the state or local law enforcement agency in 578
reviewing, blurring or otherwise obscuring, redacting, 579
uploading, or producing the video records, including but not 580
limited to the storage medium on which the record is produced, 581
staff time, and any other relevant overhead necessary to comply 582
with the request. A state or local law enforcement agency may 583
include in its public records policy the requirement that a 584
requester pay the estimated actual cost before beginning the 585
process of preparing a video record for inspection or 586
production. Where a state or local law enforcement agency 587
imposes such a requirement, its obligation to produce a video or 588
make it available for inspection begins once the estimated 589
actual cost is paid in full by the requester. A state or local 590
law enforcement agency shall provide the requester with the 591
estimated actual cost within five business days of receipt of 592
the public records request. If the actual cost exceeds the 593
estimated actual cost, a state or local law enforcement agency 594
may charge a requester for the difference upon fulfilling a 595
request for video records if the requester is notified in 596
advance that the actual cost may be up to twenty per cent higher 597

S. B. No. 123 Page 22
As Introduced
than the estimated actual cost. A state or local law enforcement 598
agency shall not charge a requester a difference that exceeds 599
twenty per cent of the estimated actual cost. 600
If a public record contains information that is exempt 601
from the duty to permit public inspection or to copy the public 602
record, the public office or the person responsible for the 603
public record shall make available all of the information within 604
the public record that is not exempt. When making that public 605
record available for public inspection or copying that public 606
record, the public office or the person responsible for the 607
public record shall notify the requester of any redaction or 608
make the redaction plainly visible. A redaction shall be deemed 609
a denial of a request to inspect or copy the redacted 610
information, except if federal or state law authorizes or 611
requires a public office to make the redaction. When the auditor 612
of state receives a request to inspect or to make a copy of a 613
record that was provided to the auditor of state for purposes of 614
an audit, but the original public office has asserted to the 615
auditor of state that the record is not a public record, the 616
auditor of state may handle the requests by directing the 617
requestor to the original public office that provided the record 618
to the auditor of state. 619
(2) To facilitate broader access to public records, a 620
public office or the person responsible for public records shall 621
organize and maintain public records in a manner that they can 622
be made available for inspection or copying in accordance with 623
division (B) of this section. A public office also shall have 624
available a copy of its current records retention schedule at a 625
location readily available to the public. If a requester makes 626
an ambiguous or overly broad request or has difficulty in making 627
a request for copies or inspection of public records under this 628

S. B. No. 123 Page 23
As Introduced
section such that the public office or the person responsible 629
for the requested public record cannot reasonably identify what 630
public records are being requested, the public office or the 631
person responsible for the requested public record may deny the 632
request but shall provide the requester with an opportunity to 633
revise the request by informing the requester of the manner in 634
which records are maintained by the public office and accessed 635
in the ordinary course of the public office's or person's 636
duties. 637
(3) If a request is ultimately denied, in part or in 638
whole, the public office or the person responsible for the 639
requested public record shall provide the requester with an 640
explanation, including legal authority, setting forth why the 641
request was denied. If the initial request was provided in 642
writing, the explanation also shall be provided to the requester 643
in writing. The explanation shall not preclude the public office 644
or the person responsible for the requested public record from 645
relying upon additional reasons or legal authority in defending 646
an action commenced under division (C) of this section. 647
(4) Unless specifically required or authorized by state or 648
federal law or in accordance with division (B) of this section, 649
no public office or person responsible for public records may 650
limit or condition the availability of public records by 651
requiring disclosure of the requester's identity or the intended 652
use of the requested public record. Any requirement that the 653
requester disclose the requester's identity or the intended use 654
of the requested public record constitutes a denial of the 655
request. 656
(5) A public office or person responsible for public 657
records may ask a requester to make the request in writing, may 658

S. B. No. 123 Page 24
As Introduced
ask for the requester's identity, and may inquire about the 659
intended use of the information requested, but may do so only 660
after disclosing to the requester that a written request is not 661
mandatory, that the requester may decline to reveal the 662
requester's identity or the intended use, and when a written 663
request or disclosure of the identity or intended use would 664
benefit the requester by enhancing the ability of the public 665
office or person responsible for public records to identify, 666
locate, or deliver the public records sought by the requester. 667
(6) If any person requests a copy of a public record in 668
accordance with division (B) of this section, the public office 669
or person responsible for the public record may require the 670
requester to pay in advance the cost involved in providing the 671
copy of the public record in accordance with the choice made by 672
the requester under this division. The public office or the 673
person responsible for the public record shall permit the 674
requester to choose to have the public record duplicated upon 675
paper, upon the same medium upon which the public office or 676
person responsible for the public record keeps it, or upon any 677
other medium upon which the public office or person responsible 678
for the public record determines that it reasonably can be 679
duplicated as an integral part of the normal operations of the 680
public office or person responsible for the public record. When 681
the requester makes a choice under this division, the public 682
office or person responsible for the public record shall provide 683
a copy of it in accordance with the choice made by the 684
requester. Nothing in this section requires a public office or 685
person responsible for the public record to allow the requester 686
of a copy of the public record to make the copies of the public 687
record. 688
(7)(a) Upon a request made in accordance with division (B) 689

of this section and subject to division (B)(6) of this section, 690
a public office or person responsible for public records shall 691
transmit a copy of a public record to any person by United 692
States mail or by any other means of delivery or transmission 693
within a reasonable period of time after receiving the request 694
for the copy. The public office or person responsible for the 695
public record may require the person making the request to pay 696
in advance the cost of postage if the copy is transmitted by 697
United States mail or the cost of delivery if the copy is 698
transmitted other than by United States mail, and to pay in 699
advance the costs incurred for other supplies used in the 700
mailing, delivery, or transmission. 701
(b) Any public office may adopt a policy and procedures 702
that it will follow in transmitting, within a reasonable period 703
of time after receiving a request, copies of public records by 704
United States mail or by any other means of delivery or 705
transmission pursuant to division (B)(7) of this section. A 706
public office that adopts a policy and procedures under division 707
(B)(7) of this section shall comply with them in performing its 708
duties under that division. 709
(c) In any policy and procedures adopted under division 710
(B)(7) of this section: 711
(i) A public office may limit the number of records 712
requested by a person that the office will physically deliver by 713
United States mail or by another delivery service to ten per 714
month, unless the person certifies to the office in writing that 715
the person does not intend to use or forward the requested 716
records, or the information contained in them, for commercial 717
purposes; 718
(ii) A public office that chooses to provide some or all 719

of its public records on a web site that is fully accessible to 720
and searchable by members of the public at all times, other than 721
during acts of God outside the public office's control or 722
maintenance, and that charges no fee to search, access, 723
download, or otherwise receive records provided on the web site, 724
may limit to ten per month the number of records requested by a 725
person that the office will deliver in a digital format, unless 726
the requested records are not provided on the web site and 727
unless the person certifies to the office in writing that the 728
person does not intend to use or forward the requested records, 729
or the information contained in them, for commercial purposes. 730
(iii) For purposes of division (B)(7) of this section, 731
"commercial" shall be narrowly construed and does not include 732
reporting or gathering news, reporting or gathering information 733
to assist citizen oversight or understanding of the operation or 734
activities of government, or nonprofit educational research. 735
(8) A public office or person responsible for public 736
records is not required to permit a person who is incarcerated 737
pursuant to a criminal conviction or a juvenile adjudication to 738
inspect or to obtain a copy of any public record concerning a 739
criminal investigation or prosecution or concerning what would 740
be a criminal investigation or prosecution if the subject of the 741
investigation or prosecution were an adult, unless the request 742
to inspect or to obtain a copy of the record is for the purpose 743
of acquiring information that is subject to release as a public 744
record under this section and the judge who imposed the sentence 745
or made the adjudication with respect to the person, or the 746
judge's successor in office, finds that the information sought 747
in the public record is necessary to support what appears to be 748
a justiciable claim of the person. As used in this division, 749

person allegedly aggrieved may, subject to the requirements of 822
division (C)(2) of this section, do only one of the following, 823
and not both: 824

(3) If a requester transmits a written request by hand 854
delivery, electronic submission, or certified mail to inspect or 855
receive copies of any public record in a manner that fairly 856

requester shall be entitled to recover the amount of statutory 860
damages set forth in this division if a court determines that 861
the public office or the person responsible for public records 862
failed to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 863

failed to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 873
(B) of this section, beginning with the day on which the 874
requester files a mandamus action to recover statutory damages, 875
up to a maximum of one thousand dollars. The award of statutory 876
damages shall not be construed as a penalty, but as compensation 877
for injury arising from lost use of the requested information. 878
The existence of this injury shall be conclusively presumed. The 879
award of statutory damages shall be in addition to all other 880
remedies authorized by this section. 881
The court may reduce an award of statutory damages or not 882
award statutory damages if the court determines both of the 883
following: 884
(a) That, based on the ordinary application of statutory 885
law and case law as it existed at the time of the conduct or 886
threatened conduct of the public office or person responsible 887
for the requested public records that allegedly constitutes a 888
failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 889
(B) of this section and that was the basis of the mandamus 890
action, a well-informed public office or person responsible for 891
the requested public records reasonably would believe that the 892
conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or person 893
responsible for the requested public records did not constitute 894
a failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with 895
division (B) of this section; 896
(b) That a well-informed public office or person 897
responsible for the requested public records reasonably would 898
believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of the public 899
office or person responsible for the requested public records 900

would serve the public policy that underlies the authority that 901
is asserted as permitting that conduct or threatened conduct. 902

this section, the following apply: 904
(a)(i) If the court orders the public office or the person 905
responsible for the public record to comply with division (B) of 906
this section, the court shall determine and award to the relator 907
all court costs, which shall be construed as remedial and not 908
punitive. 909
(ii) If the court makes a determination described in 910
division (C)(4)(b)(iii) of this section, the court shall 911
determine and award to the relator all court costs, which shall 912
be construed as remedial and not punitive. 913
(b) If the court renders a judgment that orders the public 914
office or the person responsible for the public record to comply 915
with division (B) of this section or if the court determines any 916
of the following, the court may award reasonable attorney's fees 917
to the relator, subject to division (C)(5) of this section: 918
(i) The public office or the person responsible for the 919
public records failed to respond affirmatively or negatively to 920
the public records request in accordance with the time allowed 921
under division (B) of this section. 922
(ii) The public office or the person responsible for the 923
public records promised to permit the relator to inspect or 924
receive copies of the public records requested within a 925
specified period of time but failed to fulfill that promise 926
within that specified period of time. 927
(iii) The public office or the person responsible for the 928
public records acted in bad faith when the office or person 929

S. B. No. 123 Page 33
As Introduced
voluntarily made the public records available to the relator for 930
the first time after the relator commenced the mandamus action, 931
but before the court issued any order concluding whether or not 932
the public office or person was required to comply with division 933
(B) of this section. No discovery may be conducted on the issue 934
of the alleged bad faith of the public office or person 935
responsible for the public records. This division shall not be 936
construed as creating a presumption that the public office or 937
the person responsible for the public records acted in bad faith 938
when the office or person voluntarily made the public records 939
available to the relator for the first time after the relator 940
commenced the mandamus action, but before the court issued any 941
order described in this division. 942
(c) The court shall not award attorney's fees to the 943
relator if the court determines both of the following: 944
(i) That, based on the ordinary application of statutory 945
law and case law as it existed at the time of the conduct or 946
threatened conduct of the public office or person responsible 947
for the requested public records that allegedly constitutes a 948
failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 949
(B) of this section and that was the basis of the mandamus 950
action, a well-informed public office or person responsible for 951
the requested public records reasonably would believe that the 952
conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or person 953
responsible for the requested public records did not constitute 954
a failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with 955
division (B) of this section; 956
(ii) That a well-informed public office or person 957
responsible for the requested public records reasonably would 958
believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of the public 959

S. B. No. 123 Page 34
As Introduced
office or person responsible for the requested public records 960
would serve the public policy that underlies the authority that 961
is asserted as permitting that conduct or threatened conduct. 962
(5) All of the following apply to any award of reasonable 963
attorney's fees awarded under division (C)(4)(b) of this 964
section: 965
(a) The fees shall be construed as remedial and not 966
punitive. 967
(b) The fees awarded shall not exceed the total of the 968
reasonable attorney's fees incurred before the public record was 969
made available to the relator and the fees described in division 970
(C)(5)(c) of this section. 971
(c) Reasonable attorney's fees shall include reasonable 972
fees incurred to produce proof of the reasonableness and amount 973
of the fees and to otherwise litigate entitlement to the fees. 974
(d) The court may reduce the amount of fees awarded if the 975
court determines that, given the factual circumstances involved 976
with the specific public records request, an alternative means 977
should have been pursued to more effectively and efficiently 978
resolve the dispute that was subject to the mandamus action 979
filed under division (C)(1) of this section. 980
(6) If the court does not issue a writ of mandamus under 981
division (C) of this section and the court determines at that 982
time that the bringing of the mandamus action was frivolous 983
conduct as defined in division (A) of section 2323.51 of the 984
Revised Code, the court may award to the public office all court 985
costs, expenses, and reasonable attorney's fees, as determined 986
by the court. 987
(D) Chapter 1347. of the Revised Code does not limit the 988

S. B. No. 123 Page 35
As Introduced
provisions of this section. 989
(E)(1) To ensure that all employees of public offices are 990
appropriately educated about a public office's obligations under 991
division (B) of this section, all elected officials or their 992
appropriate designees shall attend training approved by the 993
attorney general as provided in section 109.43 of the Revised 994
Code. A future official may satisfy the requirements of this 995
division by attending the training before taking office, 996
provided that the future official may not send a designee in the 997
future official's place. 998
(2) All public offices shall adopt a public records policy 999
in compliance with this section for responding to public records 1000
requests. In adopting a public records policy under this 1001
division, a public office may obtain guidance from the model 1002
public records policy developed and provided to the public 1003
office by the attorney general under section 109.43 of the 1004
Revised Code. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the 1005
policy may not limit the number of public records that the 1006
public office will make available to a single person, may not 1007
limit the number of public records that it will make available 1008
during a fixed period of time, and may not establish a fixed 1009
period of time before it will respond to a request for 1010
inspection or copying of public records, unless that period is 1011
less than eight hours. 1012
The public office shall distribute the public records 1013
policy adopted by the public office under this division to the 1014
employee of the public office who is the records custodian or 1015
records manager or otherwise has custody of the records of that 1016
office. The public office shall require that employee to 1017
acknowledge receipt of the copy of the public records policy. 1018

S. B. No. 123 Page 36
As Introduced
The public office shall create a poster that describes its 1019
public records policy and shall post the poster in a conspicuous 1020
place in the public office and in all locations where the public 1021
office has branch offices. The public office may post its public 1022
records policy on the internet web site of the public office if 1023
the public office maintains an internet web site. A public 1024
office that has established a manual or handbook of its general 1025
policies and procedures for all employees of the public office 1026
shall include the public records policy of the public office in 1027
the manual or handbook. 1028
(F)(1) The bureau of motor vehicles may adopt rules 1029
pursuant to Chapter 119. of the Revised Code to reasonably limit 1030
the number of bulk commercial special extraction requests made 1031
by a person for the same records or for updated records during a 1032
calendar year. The rules may include provisions for charges to 1033
be made for bulk commercial special extraction requests for the 1034
actual cost of the bureau, plus special extraction costs, plus 1035
ten per cent. The bureau may charge for expenses for redacting 1036
information, the release of which is prohibited by law. 1037
(2) As used in division (F)(1) of this section: 1038
(a) "Actual cost" means the cost of depleted supplies, 1039
records storage media costs, actual mailing and alternative 1040
delivery costs, or other transmitting costs, and any direct 1041
equipment operating and maintenance costs, including actual 1042
costs paid to private contractors for copying services. 1043
(b) "Bulk commercial special extraction request" means a 1044
request for copies of a record for information in a format other 1045
than the format already available, or information that cannot be 1046
extracted without examination of all items in a records series, 1047
class of records, or database by a person who intends to use or 1048

S. B. No. 123 Page 37
As Introduced
forward the copies for surveys, marketing, solicitation, or 1049
resale for commercial purposes. "Bulk commercial special 1050
extraction request" does not include a request by a person who 1051
gives assurance to the bureau that the person making the request 1052
does not intend to use or forward the requested copies for 1053
surveys, marketing, solicitation, or resale for commercial 1054
purposes. 1055
(c) "Commercial" means profit-seeking production, buying, 1056
or selling of any good, service, or other product. 1057
(d) "Special extraction costs" means the cost of the time 1058
spent by the lowest paid employee competent to perform the task, 1059
the actual amount paid to outside private contractors employed 1060
by the bureau, or the actual cost incurred to create computer 1061
programs to make the special extraction. "Special extraction 1062
costs" include any charges paid to a public agency for computer 1063
or records services. 1064
(3) For purposes of divisions (F)(1) and (2) of this 1065
section, "surveys, marketing, solicitation, or resale for 1066
commercial purposes" shall be narrowly construed and does not 1067
include reporting or gathering news, reporting or gathering 1068
information to assist citizen oversight or understanding of the 1069
operation or activities of government, or nonprofit educational 1070
research. 1071
(G) A request by a defendant, counsel of a defendant, or 1072
any agent of a defendant in a criminal action that public 1073
records related to that action be made available under this 1074
section shall be considered a demand for discovery pursuant to 1075
the Criminal Rules, except to the extent that the Criminal Rules 1076
plainly indicate a contrary intent. The defendant, counsel of 1077
the defendant, or agent of the defendant making a request under 1078

S. B. No. 123 Page 38
As Introduced
this division shall serve a copy of the request on the 1079
prosecuting attorney, director of law, or other chief legal 1080
officer responsible for prosecuting the action. 1081
(H)(1) Any portion of a body-worn camera or dashboard 1082
camera recording described in divisions (A)(17)(b) to (h) of 1083
this section may be released by consent of the subject of the 1084
recording or a representative of that person, as specified in 1085
those divisions, only if either of the following applies: 1086
(a) The recording will not be used in connection with any 1087
probable or pending criminal proceedings; 1088
(b) The recording has been used in connection with a 1089
criminal proceeding that was dismissed or for which a judgment 1090
has been entered pursuant to Rule 32 of the Rules of Criminal 1091
Procedure, and will not be used again in connection with any 1092
probable or pending criminal proceedings. 1093
(2) If a public office denies a request to release a 1094
restricted portion of a body-worn camera or dashboard camera 1095
recording, as defined in division (A)(17) of this section, any 1096
person may file a mandamus action pursuant to this section or a 1097
complaint with the clerk of the court of claims pursuant to 1098
section 2743.75 of the Revised Code, requesting the court to 1099
order the release of all or portions of the recording. If the 1100
court considering the request determines that the filing 1101
articulates by clear and convincing evidence that the public 1102
interest in the recording substantially outweighs privacy 1103
interests and other interests asserted to deny release, the 1104
court shall order the public office to release the recording. 1105
Section 2. That existing section 149.43 of the Revised 1106
Code is hereby repealed. 1107

S. B. No. 123 Page 39
As Introduced
Section 3. Section 149.43 of the Revised Code is presented 1108
in this act as a composite of the section as amended by H.B. 1109
265, H.B. 315, S.B. 29 and S.B. 109 all of the 135th General 1110
Assembly. The General Assembly, applying the principle stated in 1111
division (B) of section 1.52 of the Revised Code that amendments 1112
are to be harmonized and reconciled if reasonably capable of 1113
simultaneous operation, finds that the composite is the 1114
resulting version of the section in effect prior to the 1115
effective date of the section as presented in this act. 1116
