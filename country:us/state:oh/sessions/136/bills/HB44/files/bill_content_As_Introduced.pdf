chapter, and the rules of the director of administrative 217

that evidence or in those tests. Upon the request of an 236
appointing officer, stating the kind of labor needed, the pay 237
and probable length of employment, and the number to be 238
employed, the director or commission, as applicable, shall 239
certify from the highest on the list double the number to be 240
employed; from this number, the appointing officer shall appoint 241
the number actually needed for the particular work. If more than 242
one applicant receives the same rating, priority in time of 243
application shall determine the order in which their names shall 244
be certified for appointment. 245

(2) A person who holds a position in the classified 256
service of the state and who is appointed to a position in the 257
unclassified service shall retain the right to resume the 258
position and status held by the person in the classified service 259
immediately prior to the person's appointment to the position in 260
the unclassified service, regardless of the number of positions 261
the person held in the unclassified service. An employee's right 262
to resume a position in the classified service may only be 263
exercised when an appointing authority demotes the employee to a 264
pay range lower than the employee's current pay range or revokes 265
the employee's appointment to the unclassified service and any 266
of the following apply: 267
(a) That person held a certified position prior to July 1, 268
2007, in the classified service within the appointing 269
authority's agency; 270

unclassified service due to incompetence, inefficiency, 282
dishonesty, drunkenness, immoral conduct, insubordination, 283
discourteous treatment of the public, neglect of duty, violation 284

of this chapter or the rules of the director of administrative 285
services, any other failure of good behavior, any other acts of 286

conviction of a felony while employed in the civil service; or 288
(b) Upon transfer to a different agency. 289
(4) Reinstatement to a position in the classified service 290
shall be to a position substantially equal to that position in 291
the classified service held previously, as certified by the 292
director of administrative services. If the position the person 293
previously held in the classified service has been placed in the 294
unclassified service or is otherwise unavailable, the person 295
shall be appointed to a position in the classified service 296
within the appointing authority's agency that the director of 297
administrative services certifies is comparable in compensation 298
to the position the person previously held in the classified 299
service. Service in the position in the unclassified service 300
shall be counted as service in the position in the classified 301
service held by the person immediately prior to the person's 302
appointment to the position in the unclassified service. When a 303
person is reinstated to a position in the classified service as 304
provided in this division, the person is entitled to all rights, 305
status, and benefits accruing to the position in the classified 306
service during the person's time of service in the position in 307
the unclassified service. 308
Sec. 124.30. (A) Classified positions in the civil service 309
may be filled without competition as follows: 310
(1) Whenever there are urgent reasons for filling a 311
vacancy in any position in the classified civil service and the 312
director of administrative services is unable to certify to the 313
appointing authority, upon its request, a list of persons 314

H. B. No. 44 Page 12

made. A temporary appointment longer than one hundred twenty 323
days may be made if necessary by reason of sickness, disability, 324
or other approved leave of absence of regular officers or 325
employees, in which case it may continue during the period of 326
sickness, disability, or other approved leave of absence, 327
subject to the rules of the director. 328
(2) In case of a vacancy in a position in the classified 329
civil service where peculiar and exceptional qualifications of a 330
scientific, managerial, professional, or educational character 331
are required, and upon satisfactory evidence that for specified 332
reasons competition in this special case is impracticable and 333
that the position can best be filled by a selection of some 334
designated person of high and recognized attainments in those 335
qualities, the director may suspend the provisions of sections 336
124.01 to 124.64 of the Revised Code that require competition in 337
this special case, but no suspension shall be general in its 338
application. All such cases of suspension shall be reported in 339
the annual report of the director with the reasons for each 340
suspension. The director shall suspend the provisions when 341
either of the following applies: 342
(a) The director of job and family services provides the 343
certification under section 5101.051 of the Revised Code that a 344

H. B. No. 44 Page 13
As Introduced
position with the department of job and family services can best 345
be filled if the provisions are suspended; 346
(b) The medicaid director provides the certification under 347
section 5160.051 of the Revised Code that a position with the 348
department of medicaid can best be filled if the provisions are 349
suspended. 350
(3) Except as provided in division (D) of this section, in 351
case of a vacancy in a position in the classified civil service 352
in a police department, on satisfactory evidence that for 353
specified reasons competition in this special case is 354
impracticable and that the position can best be filled by a 355
selection of some designated person holding a specialized 356
certification, possessing peculiar and exceptional 357
qualifications, or having completed a police cadet training 358
program through the police department, the director of 359
administrative services may suspend the provisions of sections 360
124.01 to 124.64 of the Revised Code that require competition in 361
this special case, but no suspension shall be general in its 362
application. 363
(B) The acceptance or refusal by an eligible person of a 364
temporary appointment under division (A)(1) of this section 365
shall not affect the person's standing on the eligible list for 366
permanent appointment, nor shall the period of temporary service 367
be counted as a part of the probationary service in case of 368
subsequent appointment to a permanent position. 369
(B) (C) Persons who receive temporary or intermittent 370
appointments under division (A)(1) of this section are in the 371
unclassified civil service and serve at the pleasure of their 372
appointing authority. 373

H. B. No. 44 Page 14
As Introduced
(D) Division (A)(3) of this section does not apply to a 374
vacancy in a position in the classified civil service in a 375
police department that must be filled by promotion as prescribed 376
in section 124.44 of the Revised Code. 377
Sec. 737.061. (A) The chief of police of a municipal 378

training and as members of the training school, may be paid a 383
reasonable salary. The chief of police may furnish the necessary 384
supplies and equipment for the use of the prospective officers 385
during the training period. 386
(B) The chief of police may establish rules governing the 387
qualifications for admission to training schools for prospective 388
officers and provide for competitive examinations to determine 389
the fitness of the students and prospective officers, not 390
inconsistent with the rules of the director of administrative 391
services. 392
(C) Upon completion of a training school program 393
established under this section, a program graduate may be hired 394
directly by the relevant department, provided the graduate also 395
satisfies the requirements for original appointment under 396
