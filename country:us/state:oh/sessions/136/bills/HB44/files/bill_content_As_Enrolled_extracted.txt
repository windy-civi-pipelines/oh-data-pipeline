administrative services certifies is comparable in compensation to the position the person previously
held in the classified service. Service in the position in the unclassified service shall be counted as
service in the position in the classified service held by the person immediately prior to the person's
appointment to the position in the unclassified service. When a person is reinstated to a position in

unskilled labor class.

upon the creation by the board of trustees of a civil service township of a township civil service

positions in the competitive class that are not filled by promotion, reinstatement, transfer, or
reduction, as provided in this chapter, and the rules of the director of administrative services, by
appointment from those certified to the appointing officer in accordance with this chapter.
(2) The unskilled labor class shall include ordinary unskilled laborers. Vacancies in the labor
class for positions in service of the state shall be filled by appointment from lists of applicants

labor class to furnish evidence or take tests as the director or commission considers proper with

and experience in the work or employment for which application is made. Laborers who fulfill the

preference shall be given in employment in accordance with the rating received from that evidence
or in those tests. Upon the request of an appointing officer, stating the kind of labor needed, the pay
and probable length of employment, and the number to be employed, the director or commission, as
applicable, shall certify from the highest on the list double the number to be employed; from this
number, the appointing officer shall appoint the number actually needed for the particular work. If
more than one applicant receives the same rating, priority in time of application shall determine the
order in which their names shall be certified for appointment.
(C) A municipal or civil service township civil service commission may place volunteer
firefighters who are paid on a fee-for-service basis in either the classified or the unclassified civil

to a position in the unclassified service shall retain the right to resume the position and status held by

service. An employee's right to resume a position in the classified service may only be exercised

Sub. H. B. No. 44 136th G.A.

when an appointing authority demotes the employee to a pay range lower than the employee's
current pay range or revokes the employee's appointment to the unclassified service and any of the

the appointing authority's agency;

service within the appointing authority's agency, and is within five years from the effective date of

(a) The employee is removed from the position in the unclassified service due to
incompetence, inefficiency, dishonesty, drunkenness, immoral conduct, insubordination,
discourteous treatment of the public, neglect of duty, violation of this chapter or the rules of the
director of administrative services, any other failure of good behavior, any other acts of misfeasance,
malfeasance, or nonfeasance in office, or conviction of a felony while employed in the civil service;
or
(b) Upon transfer to a different agency.
(4) Reinstatement to a position in the classified service shall be to a position substantially
equal to that position in the classified service held previously, as certified by the director of
administrative services. If the position the person previously held in the classified service has been
placed in the unclassified service or is otherwise unavailable, the person shall be appointed to a
position in the classified service within the appointing authority's agency that the director of
administrative services certifies is comparable in compensation to the position the person previously
held in the classified service. Service in the position in the unclassified service shall be counted as
service in the position in the classified service held by the person immediately prior to the person's
appointment to the position in the unclassified service. When a person is reinstated to a position in
the classified service as provided in this division, the person is entitled to all rights, status, and
benefits accruing to the position in the classified service during the person's time of service in the
position in the unclassified service.
Sec. 124.30. (A) Classified positions in the civil service may be filled without competition as
follows:
(1) Whenever there are urgent reasons for filling a vacancy in any position in the classified

authority, upon its request, a list of persons eligible for appointment to the position after a
competitive examination, the appointing authority may fill the position by noncompetitive
examination.

A temporary appointment may be made without regard to the rules of sections 124.01 to
124.64 of the Revised Code. Except as otherwise provided in this division, the temporary
appointment may not continue longer than one hundred twenty days, and in no case shall successive
temporary appointments be made. A temporary appointment longer than one hundred twenty days
may be made if necessary by reason of sickness, disability, or other approved leave of absence of
regular officers or employees, in which case it may continue during the period of sickness, disability,
or other approved leave of absence, subject to the rules of the director.
(2) In case of a vacancy in a position in the classified civil service where peculiar and
exceptional qualifications of a scientific, managerial, professional, or educational character are
required, and upon satisfactory evidence that for specified reasons competition in this special case is
impracticable and that the position can best be filled by a selection of some designated person of
high and recognized attainments in those qualities, the director may suspend the provisions of
sections 124.01 to 124.64 of the Revised Code that require competition in this special case, but no
suspension shall be general in its application. All such cases of suspension shall be reported in the
annual report of the director with the reasons for each suspension. The director shall suspend the
provisions when either of the following applies:
(a) The director of job and family services provides the certification under section 5101.051
of the Revised Code that a position with the department of job and family services can best be filled
if the provisions are suspended;
(b) The medicaid director provides the certification under section 5160.051 of the Revised
Code that a position with the department of medicaid can best be filled if the provisions are
suspended.
(3) Except as provided in division (D) of this section, in case of a vacancy in a position in
the classified civil service in a police department, on satisfactory evidence that for specified reasons
competition in this special case is impracticable and that the position can best be filled by a selection
of some designated person holding a specialized certification, possessing peculiar and exceptional
qualifications, or having completed a police cadet training program through the police department,
the director of administrative services may suspend the provisions of sections 124.01 to 124.64 of
the Revised Code that require competition in this special case, but no suspension shall be general in
its application.
(B) The acceptance or refusal by an eligible person of a temporary appointment under
division (A)(1) of this section shall not affect the person's standing on the eligible list for permanent
appointment, nor shall the period of temporary service be counted as a part of the probationary
service in case of subsequent appointment to a permanent position.
(B) (C) Persons who receive temporary or intermittent appointments under division (A)(1) of
this section are in the unclassified civil service and serve at the pleasure of their appointing
authority.
