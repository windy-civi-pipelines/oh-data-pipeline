service. Service in the position in the unclassified service 378

appointment to the position in the unclassified service. When a 381
person is reinstated to a position in the classified service as 382
provided in this division, the person is entitled to all rights, 383

vacancy in any position in the classified civil service and the 390
director of administrative services is unable to certify to the 391
appointing authority, upon its request, a list of persons 392
eligible for appointment to the position after a competitive 393

sickness, disability, or other approved leave of absence, 405
subject to the rules of the director. 406
(2) In case of a vacancy in a position in the classified 407
civil service where peculiar and exceptional qualifications of a 408
scientific, managerial, professional, or educational character 409
are required, and upon satisfactory evidence that for specified 410
reasons competition in this special case is impracticable and 411
that the position can best be filled by a selection of some 412
designated person of high and recognized attainments in those 413
qualities, the director may suspend the provisions of sections 414
124.01 to 124.64 of the Revised Code that require competition in 415
this special case, but no suspension shall be general in its 416
application. All such cases of suspension shall be reported in 417
the annual report of the director with the reasons for each 418
suspension. The director shall suspend the provisions when 419
either of the following applies: 420
(a) The director of job and family services provides the 421
certification under section 5101.051 of the Revised Code that a 422
position with the department of job and family services can best 423
be filled if the provisions are suspended; 424
(b) The medicaid director provides the certification under 425
section 5160.051 of the Revised Code that a position with the 426
department of medicaid can best be filled if the provisions are 427

impracticable and that the position can best be filled by a 433
selection of some designated person holding a specialized 434
certification, possessing peculiar and exceptional 435
qualifications, or having completed a police cadet training 436
program through the police department, the director of 437
administrative services may suspend the provisions of sections 438
124.01 to 124.64 of the Revised Code that require competition in 439
this special case, but no suspension shall be general in its 440
application. 441
(B) The acceptance or refusal by an eligible person of a 442
temporary appointment under division (A)(1) of this section 443
shall not affect the person's standing on the eligible list for 444
permanent appointment, nor shall the period of temporary service 445
be counted as a part of the probationary service in case of 446
subsequent appointment to a permanent position. 447
(B) (C) Persons who receive temporary or intermittent 448
appointments under division (A)(1) of this section are in the 449
unclassified civil service and serve at the pleasure of their 450
appointing authority. 451
(D) Division (A)(3) of this section does not apply to a 452
vacancy in a position in the classified civil service in a 453
