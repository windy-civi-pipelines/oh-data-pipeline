Honoring St. Peter Catholic Church on its One Hundred
Fiftieth Anniversary.
WHEREAS, The members of the House of Representatives of the 136th 1
General Assembly of Ohio are pleased to congratulate St. Peter 2
Catholic Church on the auspicious occasion of its One Hundred Fiftieth 3
Anniversary; and 4
WHEREAS, Recognition of this significant milestone is a fitting 5
tribute to St. Peter Catholic Church, for over the past century and a 6
half, it has attained a praiseworthy record of service. The 7
achievements of this fine house of worship are a justifiable source of 8
pride and an excellent reflection not only on the church itself but 9
also on its devoted pastor, the Reverend Father Robert Franco, on its 10
members, and on the North Ridgeville community; and 11
WHEREAS, The source of many social, religious, and humanitarian 12
projects and programs, St. Peter Catholic Church has enhanced the 13
quality of life in the area since its inception in 1875, and its 14
generous contributions have earned it the gratitude and respect of the 15
many citizens it has so capably served. We are certain that in the 16
years to come, the church will maintain the tradition of spiritual 17
enlightenment that has long been its hallmark; and 18
WHEREAS, The members of the St. Peter Catholic Church have long 19
been actively involved in, and concerned about, the events in their 20
community, and this celebration offers them a unique opportunity to 21
share their memories and to reflect on the benefits of life in their 22
close-knit community. The congregation can, indeed, be proud of their 23
church, for they have built on the best traditions of the past to 24
ensure a peaceful and robust future; therefore be it 25
