Sec. 5705.262. (A)(1) The electors of a subdivision or 8

of the subdivision or other taxing unit within the ten-mill 10
limitation by filing a petition with the board of elections of 11
the county in which the subdivision or other taxing unit is 12
located. If the subdivision or other taxing unit has territory 13
in more than one county, the petition shall be filed with the 14
board of elections of the county in which the most populous 15
portion of the subdivision or other taxing unit is located. 16

in favor of the proposed reduction that does not exceed three 20
hundred words, shall designate a committee of between three and 21
five electors to represent the petitioners, and shall be signed 22
by qualified electors of the subdivision or other taxing unit 23
equal in number to at least fifteen per cent of the total number 24
of votes cast in the subdivision or other taxing unit for the 25
office of governor at the most recent general election for that 26
office. 27
(3) Immediately upon the filing of the petition, the board 28
shall notify the taxing authority. During the period beginning 29
on the day the petition is filed with the board and ending on 30
the day the board certifies the results of the election on the 31
question of the reduction, neither the taxing authority nor the 32
county budget commission may change the rate of the levy. If the 33
petition is determined to be insufficient or invalid, the 34
restriction described in this division ceases to apply to the 35
taxing authority and county budget commission. 36
(4) If the board determines that the petition is 37
sufficient and valid, the question shall be submitted to the 38
electors of the subdivision or other taxing unit for their 39
approval or rejection at the next general election held at least 40
one hundred twenty days after the petition is filed with the 41
board. 42
(B) The board of elections shall do both of the following 43
at least ninety days before the day of the election at which a 44
question is submitted to the electors under this section: 45
(1) Request that the county auditor certify to the board, 46
in the same manner as required for a tax levy under section 47
5705.03 of the Revised Code, an estimate of the levy's annual 48
collections and the levy's rate in both the last year before the 49

proposed reduction and the first year that the reduction 50
applies, stated in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar, for 51
each one hundred thousand dollars of the county auditor's 52
appraised value. If the subdivision or other taxing unit is 53
located in more than one county, the county auditor shall obtain 54
from the county auditor of each other county in which the 55
subdivision or other taxing unit is located the tax valuation 56
applicable to the portion of the subdivision or other taxing 57
unit in that county. The county auditor shall certify that 58
information to the board of elections within ten days after 59
receiving the board's request. 60

subdivision or other taxing unit provide a written argument in 62
opposition to the proposed reduction that does not exceed three 63
hundred words. The taxing authority shall file the argument with 64
the board of elections at least eighty days before the day of 65
the election. If the taxing authority fails to prepare and file 66
the argument by that date, the board of elections shall prepare 67
the argument or shall designate a group of persons to prepare 68
the argument and file it with the board not later than the 69
seventy-fifth day before the day of the election. 70
