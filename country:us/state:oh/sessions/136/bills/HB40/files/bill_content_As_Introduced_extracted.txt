(iv) Round the resulting sum to the nearest multiple of 74
one hundred dollars. 75
The commissioner shall certify the amount resulting from 76
each adjustment to each county auditor not later than the first 77

amount applies amounts apply to the following tax year for 79
persons described in division (A)(1)(b)(iii) or (A)(2) of this 80

property in money, as adjusted under division (A)(1)(d) of this 94
section, by the amounts described in divisions (A)(1)(c)(ii) to 95
(iv) of this section. For a disabled veteran whose total income 96
does not exceed one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars, as 97
adjusted under division (A)(1)(d) of this section, the reduction 98
shall equal the product obtained by multiplying one hundred 99
thousand dollars of the true value of the property in money, as 100
adjusted under division (A)(1)(d) of this section, by the 101
amounts described in divisions (A)(1)(c)(ii) to (iv) of this 102
section. The reduction is in lieu of any reduction under section 103
323.158 of the Revised Code or division (A)(1), (2)(b), or (3) 104

H. B. No. 40 Page 5
As Introduced
of this section. The reduction applies to only one homestead 105
owned and occupied by a disabled veteran. 106
(b) Real property taxes on a homestead owned and occupied, 107
or a homestead in a housing cooperative occupied, by the 108
surviving spouse of a disabled veteran shall be reduced for each 109
year an application for exemption is approved. The reduction 110
shall equal to the amount of the reduction authorized under 111
division (A)(2)(a) of this section, except that the amount shall 112
be determined based on the total income of the surviving spouse. 113
The reduction is in lieu of any reduction under section 114
323.158 of the Revised Code or division (A)(1), (2)(a), or (3) 115
of this section. The reduction applies to only one homestead 116
owned and occupied by the surviving spouse of a disabled 117
veteran. A homestead qualifies for a reduction in taxes under 118
division (A)(2)(b) of this section beginning in one of the 119
following tax years: 120
(i) For a surviving spouse described in division (L)(1) of 121
section 323.151 of the Revised Code, the year the disabled 122
veteran dies; 123
(ii) For a surviving spouse described in division (L)(2) 124
of section 323.151 of the Revised Code, the first year on the 125
first day of January of which the total disability rating 126
described in division (F) of that section has been received for 127
the deceased spouse. 128
In either case, the reduction shall continue through the 129
tax year in which the surviving spouse dies or remarries. 130
(3) Real property taxes on a homestead owned and occupied, 131
or a homestead in a housing cooperative occupied, by the 132
surviving spouse of a public service officer killed in the line 133

H. B. No. 40 Page 6
As Introduced
of duty shall be reduced for each year for which an application 134
for the reduction has been approved. The reduction shall equal 135
the product obtained by multiplying fifty thousand dollars of 136
the true value of the property in money, as adjusted under 137
division (A)(1)(d) of this section, by the amounts described in 138
divisions (A)(1)(c)(ii) to (iv) of this section. The reduction 139
is in lieu of any reduction under section 323.158 of the Revised 140
Code or division (A)(1) or (2) of this section. The reduction 141
applies to only one homestead owned and occupied by such a 142
surviving spouse. A homestead qualifies for a reduction in taxes 143
under division (A)(3) of this section for the tax year in which 144
the public service officer dies through the tax year in which 145
the surviving spouse dies or remarries. 146
(B) To provide a partial exemption, real property taxes on 147
any homestead, and manufactured home taxes on any manufactured 148
or mobile home on which a manufactured home tax is assessed 149
pursuant to division (D)(2) of section 4503.06 of the Revised 150
Code, shall be reduced for each year for which an application 151
for the reduction has been approved. The amount of the reduction 152
shall equal two and one-half per cent of the amount of taxes to 153
be levied by qualifying levies on the homestead or the 154
manufactured or mobile home after applying section 319.301 of 155
the Revised Code. For the purposes of this division, "qualifying 156
levy" has the same meaning as in section 319.302 of the Revised 157
Code. 158
(C) The reductions granted by this section do not apply to 159
special assessments or respread of assessments levied against 160
the homestead, and if there is a transfer of ownership 161
subsequent to the filing of an application for a reduction in 162
taxes, such reductions are not forfeited for such year by virtue 163
of such transfer. 164

H. B. No. 40 Page 7
As Introduced
(D) The reductions in taxable value referred to in this 165
section shall be applied solely as a factor for the purpose of 166
computing the reduction of taxes under this section and shall 167
not affect the total value of property in any subdivision or 168
taxing district as listed and assessed for taxation on the tax 169
lists and duplicates, or any direct or indirect limitations on 170
indebtedness of a subdivision or taxing district. If after 171
application of sections 5705.31 and 5705.32 of the Revised Code, 172
including the allocation of all levies within the ten-mill 173
limitation to debt charges to the extent therein provided, there 174
would be insufficient funds for payment of debt charges not 175
provided for by levies in excess of the ten-mill limitation, the 176
reduction of taxes provided for in sections 323.151 to 323.159 177
of the Revised Code shall be proportionately adjusted to the 178
extent necessary to provide such funds from levies within the 179
ten-mill limitation. 180
(E) No reduction shall be made on the taxes due on the 181
homestead of any person convicted of violating division (D) or 182
(E) of section 323.153 of the Revised Code for a period of three 183
years following the conviction. 184

home that is paid pursuant to division (C) of section 4503.06 of 197
the Revised Code and that is owned and occupied as a home by an 198
individual whose domicile is in this state and to whom this 199
section applies, shall be reduced for any tax year for which an 200
application for such reduction has been approved, provided the 201
individual did not acquire ownership from a person, other than 202
the individual's spouse, related by consanguinity or affinity 203
for the purpose of qualifying for the reduction. An owner 204
includes a settlor of a revocable or irrevocable inter vivos 205
trust holding the title to a manufactured or mobile home 206
occupied by the settlor as of right under the trust. 207

reduction under division (A) of this section for tax year 2014 217
