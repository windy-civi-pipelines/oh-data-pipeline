than $800 billion owned by individuals in China; and 11

Fund and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be 19
depleted in 2033 and 2036; and 20
WHEREAS, Improvements in the business climate in populous 21
countries and aging populations around the world likely will 22
contribute to higher global interest rates, which would squeeze 23
all United States policy priorities, including defense and 24
foreign policy; and 25
WHEREAS, On September 22, 2011, former Chairman of the 26
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Michael Mullen warned, "the single 27
biggest threat to our national security is debt"; and 28
WHEREAS, On March 6, 2018, then Director of National 29
Intelligence Dan Coats warned, "Our continued plunge into debt 30
is unsustainable and represents a dire future threat to our 31
economy and to our national security"; and 32
WHEREAS, The payment on the interest of national debt now 33
exceeds total United States Defense spending causing future 34
uncertainty over the ability to defend our national interests; 35
now therefore be it 36
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the 136th General 37
Assembly of the State of Ohio, recognize that the national debt 38
is a threat to the national security of the United States and 39
urge the United States Congress to commit to establishing an 40
effective regular order for budgeting; and be it further 41
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives 42
transmit duly authenticated copies of this resolution to each 43
member of the Ohio Congressional delegation and to the news 44
media of Ohio. 45
