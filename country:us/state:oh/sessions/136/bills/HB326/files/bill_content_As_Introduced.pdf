The department shall, as necessary to implement division 61
(B)(2)(b) of this section, seek a waiver from the United States 62
secretary of education for testing requirements prescribed under 63
federal law to allow for the use and implementation of Algebra I 64

under any other advanced standing program, as described in 95

(i) The student is considered to have attained a 172
proficient score on the end-of-course examination from which the 173
student is exempt; 174
(ii) The student's final course grade shall be used in 175

adopt guidelines for purposes of calculating the corresponding 179
final course grades and the minimum cumulative performance score 180
that demonstrates the level of academic achievement necessary to 181
earn a high school diploma. 182
