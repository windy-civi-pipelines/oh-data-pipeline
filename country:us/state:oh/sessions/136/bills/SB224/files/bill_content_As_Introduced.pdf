court has modified or quashed the subpoena, extended the day on 126
which the subpoena is to be returned, or issued any other order 127
with respect to the subpoena prior to the day on which the 128
subpoena is to be returned. If a person fails without lawful 129
excuse to testify or to produce relevant matter pursuant to a 130

pleas of the county in which the person subpoenaed resides or in 132
which the person's principal place of business is located for an 133
order that compels compliance with the subpoena. 134

matter may incriminate the individual, the attorney general may 138
request the court to order the individual to provide the 139
testimony or matter. With the exception of a prosecution for 140
perjury or a civil action for damages under division (D)(1) of 141
this section, an individual who complies with a court order to 142
provide testimony or matter, after asserting a privilege against 143
self-incrimination to which the individual is entitled by law, 144
shall not be subjected to a criminal proceeding or a civil 145
penalty or forfeiture on the basis of the testimony or matter 146
required to be disclosed or testimony or matter discovered 147
through that testimony or matter required to be disclosed. 148
(6) In conducting an investigation under this section, the 149
attorney general shall not publicly disclose the identity of 150
persons, entities, merchants, sellers, or telemarketers 151
investigated or the facts developed in the investigation unless 152
this information has become a matter of public record in 153
enforcement proceedings or if those being investigated have 154
consented in writing to public disclosure. 155
(7) In conducting an investigation under this section, the 156
attorney general shall cooperate with state and local officials 157
of other states and officials of the federal government in the 158
administration of comparable laws and regulations. 159
(8) The attorney general may do either of the following: 160
(a) During an investigation under division (C) of this 161
section, afford the person who is the subject of the 162
investigation, in a manner considered appropriate to that 163
person, an opportunity to cease and desist from any suspected 164
violation of this section or any provision of a federal act or 165
rule. The attorney general may suspend the investigation during 166
the period that the attorney general permits the person to cease 167

S. B. No. 224 Page 7
As Introduced
and desist from that suspected violation. The suspension of the 168
investigation or the affording of an opportunity to cease and 169
desist shall not prejudice or prohibit any further investigation 170
by the attorney general under division (C) of this section. 171
(b) Terminate an investigation under division (C) of this 172
section upon acceptance of a written assurance of voluntary 173
compliance from a person who is suspected of a violation of this 174
section or any provision of a federal act or rule. The 175
acceptance of an assurance under division (C)(8)(b) of this 176
section may be conditioned upon an undertaking to reimburse or 177
to take other appropriate corrective action with respect to 178
identifiable telephone service subscribers who are damaged by an 179
alleged violation of this section or any provision of a federal 180
act or rule. An assurance of compliance given by a person under 181
division (C)(8)(b) of this section is not evidence of a 182
violation of this section or any provision of a federal act or 183
rule. The attorney general, at any time, may reopen an 184
investigation terminated by the acceptance of an assurance of 185
voluntary compliance, if the attorney general believes that 186
further proceedings are in the public interest. Evidence of a 187
violation of an assurance of voluntary compliance is prima-facie 188
evidence of an act or practice in violation of this section or 189
the applicable provision of a federal act or rule if the 190
evidence is presented after the violation in a civil action 191
brought under division (D)(1) of this section. An assurance of 192
voluntary compliance may be filed with the court and if approved 193
by the court, entered as a consent judgment in the action. 194
(9) The procedures that are available to the attorney 195
general under division (C) of this section are cumulative and 196
concurrent, and the exercise of one procedure by the attorney 197
general does not preclude or require the exercise of any other 198

S. B. No. 224 Page 8

procedure. 199
(D)(1) If, by the attorney general's own inquiries or as a 200
result of complaints or an investigation conducted under 201
division (C) of this section, the attorney general has 202
reasonable cause to believe that a person has engaged or is 203
engaging in a violation of any provision of this section or of a 204
federal act or rule, the attorney general, subject to division 205
(D)(3) or (4) of this section, may bring in the appropriate 206
court of common pleas of this state or in the appropriate 207
district court of the United States, but not in both courts, a 208
civil action against the alleged violator for injunctive relief, 209
damages, and civil penalties pursuant to the federal act or 210
rule, on behalf of the residents of this state who have been 211
subjected to acts or practices in violation of this section. The 212
attorney general may bring the action under this section or 213
under the applicable federal act or rule, but the attorney 214
general shall not plead a violation of both this section and the 215
applicable federal act or rule in the action. 216
(2) On the motion of the attorney general or on its own 217
motion, a court may impose a civil penalty of five hundred 218
dollars for each violation of the provision of this section or 219
of the federal act or rule that is the subject of the action. If 220
the court finds the defendant willfully or knowingly committed 221
the violation, the court may impose a civil penalty of one 222
thousand five hundred dollars for each violation of the 223
provision of this section or of the federal act or rules that is 224
the subject of the action. An award of damages or civil 225
penalties may be recovered under this section or under the 226
applicable federal act or rule, but an award of damages or civil 227
penalties shall not be recovered under both this section and the 228
applicable federal act or rule. 229

(3) If a civil action has been instituted by or on behalf 230
of the federal trade commission or the federal communications 231
commission for a violation of any provision of an applicable 232
federal act or rule, the attorney general, during the pendency 233
of that action, shall not institute any civil action under 234
division (D)(1) of this section against any defendant that is 235
named in the complaint in the civil action that has been 236
instituted by or on behalf of the federal trade commission or 237
the federal communications commission, whichever is applicable, 238
for any violation that is alleged in that complaint. 239
(4) If a civil action that has been instituted by or on 240
behalf of the federal trade commission or the federal 241
communications commission for a violation of any provision of an 242
applicable federal act or rule affecting the residents of this 243
state is litigated to its conclusion and the federal trade 244
commission or the federal communications commission recovers an 245
award of damages or civil penalties or obtains any relief under 246
the applicable federal act or rule, the attorney general shall 247
not institute any civil action under division (D)(1) of this 248
section for any violation within the same time period that is 249
alleged in the civil action that was instituted as described in 250
division (D)(4) of this section and in which the federal trade 251
commission or federal communications commission has recovered 252
the damages or civil penalties or obtained the relief. 253
(5) No action may be brought by the attorney general under 254
this section for damages or a civil penalty more than five years 255
after the occurrence of the violation. 256
(E) Any civil action that the attorney general brings in a 257
federal court under division (D)(1) of this section shall comply 258
with the applicable provisions of the federal act or rule the 259

credit of the telemarketing fraud enforcement fund created under 263
section 4719.17 of the Revised Code, to be used to pay the costs 264
of the office of the attorney general in investigating any 265
violation of, and in enforcing, any federal act or rule or this 266
section or for any other purpose as set forth under section 267
4719.17 of the Revised Code. 268
(G) A violation of division (B)(1) or (2) of this section 269
that involves a consumer transaction as defined in section 270

deceptive act or practice in violation of section 1345.02 of the 272
Revised Code. All powers and remedies available to the attorney 273
