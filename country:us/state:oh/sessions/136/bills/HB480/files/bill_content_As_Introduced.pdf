format. If no address is listed, the notice shall be published 884
in the county in which the holder of the unclaimed funds has its 885
principal place of business within this state; or if the holder 886
has no principal place of business within this state, 887

known address is located. If the last known address is in a 892

addresses, if any, of each person appearing from the records of 902
the holder to be the owner of unclaimed funds of a value of 903
fifty dollars or more and entitled to notice as specified in 904
division (A) of this section; 905
(2) A statement that information concerning the amount of 906
the funds and any necessary information concerning the 907
presentment of a claim therefor may be obtained by any persons 908
possessing a property interest in the unclaimed funds by 909
addressing an inquiry to the director. 910
(C) With respect to items of unclaimed funds each having a 911
value of ten dollars or more, the director shall have available 912
in the director's office during business hours an alphabetical 913
list of owners and where a holder is a person providing life 914

the holder to the director. 938

such organization for the amount of the judgment or enter into 946

chapter, the director shall, upon proof of satisfaction of such 956
judgment, forthwith reimburse such organization for the amount 957
so paid or enter into an agreement modified to reflect the 958

residing within or without this state in the same manner as is 1011
prescribed by law for the taking of depositions in civil actions 1012
in the court of common pleas, and for that purpose the director 1013
may issue a subpoena for any witness or a subpoena duces tecum 1014
to compel the production of any books, records, or papers, 1015
directed to the sheriff of the county where such witness resides 1016
or is found, which shall be served and returned. The fees of the 1017
