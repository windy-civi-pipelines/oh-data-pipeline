(B)(1) Upon request by any person and subject to division 559
(B)(8) of this section, all public records responsive to the 560
request shall be promptly prepared and made available for 561
inspection to the requester at all reasonable times during 562
regular business hours. Subject to division (B)(8) of this 563
section, upon request by any person, a public office or person 564
responsible for public records shall make copies of the 565
requested public record available to the requester at cost and 566
within a reasonable period of time. 567

As Introduced
When considering whether a state or local law enforcement 568
agency promptly prepared a video record for inspection or 569
provided a video record for production within a reasonable 570
period of time, in addition to any other factors, a court shall 571
consider the time required for a state or local law enforcement 572
agency to retrieve, download, review, redact, seek legal advice 573
regarding, and produce the video record. Notwithstanding any 574
other requirement set forth in Chapter 149. of the Revised Code, 575
a state or local law enforcement agency may charge a requester 576
the actual cost associated with preparing a video record for 577
inspection or production, not to exceed seventy-five dollars per 578
hour of video produced, nor seven hundred fifty dollars total. 579
As used in this division, "actual cost," with respect to video 580
records only, means all costs incurred by the state or local law 581
enforcement agency in reviewing, blurring or otherwise 582
obscuring, redacting, uploading, or producing the video records, 583
including but not limited to the storage medium on which the 584
record is produced, staff time, and any other relevant overhead 585
necessary to comply with the request. A state or local law 586
enforcement agency may include in its public records policy the 587
requirement that a requester pay the estimated actual cost 588
before beginning the process of preparing a video record for 589
inspection or production. Where a state or local law enforcement 590
agency imposes such a requirement, its obligation to produce a 591
video or make it available for inspection begins once the 592
estimated actual cost is paid in full by the requester. A state 593
or local law enforcement agency shall provide the requester with 594
the estimated actual cost within five business days of receipt 595
of the public records request. If the actual cost exceeds the 596
estimated actual cost, a state or local law enforcement agency 597
may charge a requester for the difference upon fulfilling a 598
request for video records if the requester is notified in 599

H. B. No. 314 Page 22
As Introduced
advance that the actual cost may be up to twenty per cent higher 600
than the estimated actual cost. A state or local law enforcement 601
agency shall not charge a requester a difference that exceeds 602
twenty per cent of the estimated actual cost. 603
If a public record contains information that is exempt 604
from the duty to permit public inspection or to copy the public 605
record, the public office or the person responsible for the 606
public record shall make available all of the information within 607
the public record that is not exempt. When making that public 608
record available for public inspection or copying that public 609
record, the public office or the person responsible for the 610
public record shall notify the requester of any redaction or 611
make the redaction plainly visible. A redaction shall be deemed 612
a denial of a request to inspect or copy the redacted 613
information, except if federal or state law authorizes or 614
requires a public office to make the redaction. When the auditor 615
of state receives a request to inspect or to make a copy of a 616
record that was provided to the auditor of state for purposes of 617
an audit, but the original public office has asserted to the 618
auditor of state that the record is not a public record, the 619
auditor of state may handle the requests by directing the 620
requestor to the original public office that provided the record 621
to the auditor of state. 622
(2)(2)(a) To facilitate broader access to public records, 623
a public office or the person responsible for public records 624
shall organize and maintain public records in a manner that they 625
can be made available for inspection or copying in accordance 626
with division (B) of this section. A public office also shall 627
have available a copy of its current records retention schedule 628
at a location readily available to the public. 629

H. B. No. 314 Page 23
As Introduced
(b) If a requester makes an ambiguous or overly broad 630
request or has difficulty in making a request for copies or 631
inspection of public records under this section such that the 632
public office or the person responsible for the requested public 633
record cannot reasonably identify what public records are being 634
requested, the public office or the person responsible for the 635
requested public record may deny the request but shall provide 636
the requester with an opportunity to revise the request by 637
informing the requester of the manner in which records are 638
maintained by the public office and accessed in the ordinary 639
course of the public office's or person's duties. 640
(c)(i) If a requester submits multiple related or 641
unrelated requests for copying or inspection of public records 642
to the same public office or person responsible for a public 643
record and, based on the volume or the repeated nature of the 644
requests, the public office or person has reason to believe that 645
the requests are intended to harass the public office or person 646
or to disrupt the essential functions of the public office or 647
person, the public office or person may bring an action in the 648
court of common pleas of the county in which the public office 649
or person is located requesting the court to limit or deny the 650
requests. 651
(ii) The action shall proceed as any other civil action, 652
and the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure apply to the action. The 653
court shall provide the requester with notice of the action and 654
an opportunity to be heard. While the action or any appeal from 655
a final order of the court is pending, the requirement that the 656
public office or person respond to the requests under this 657
section is tolled. 658
(iii) If the court determines by a preponderance of the 659

H. B. No. 314 Page 24
As Introduced
evidence that the requests are intended to harass the public 660
office or person or to disrupt the essential functions of the 661
public office or person, the court may limit or deny the 662
requests. If the court determines by a preponderance of the 663
evidence that the requester is likely to submit future requests 664
for copying or inspection of public records to that public 665
office or person for the purpose of harassing the public office 666
or person or disrupting the essential functions of the public 667
office or person, the court also may issue an order that limits 668
or denies any such future requests submitted to the public 669
office or person by that requester. An order issued under this 670
division remains in force indefinitely unless the order provides 671
for its expiration after a specified period of time. 672
(iv) Division (B)(2)(c) of this section does not apply to 673
a requester who is any of the following: 674
(I) A journalist as defined in division (B)(9)(c) of this 675
section; 676
(II) A pro se litigant who requests records pertaining to 677
litigation in which the pro se litigant is a named party; 678
(III) A state agency, including a public college or 679
university or subsidiary of a public college or university, as 680
well as a public defender or other government attorney, or the 681
staff or agent of a public defender or government attorney. This 682
exemption does not apply to a public defender whose request for 683
records is not related to a matter that is within the scope of 684
the public defender's employment with a public defender's office 685
or selection or appointment under section 120.33 of the Revised 686
Code. 687
(v) No court shall limit, deny, or restrict the access of 688

any requester listed under division (B)(2)(c)(iv) of this 689
section to any public record under division (B)(2)(c) of this 690
section. 691
(vi) A public office or person responsible for public 692
records shall not bring an action under division (B)(2)(c)(i) of 693
this section against a requester who the public office or person 694
knows or has reason to believe is a public defender unless the 695
requester fails to provide sufficient evidence in response to a 696
request for evidence made pursuant to division (B)(11) of this 697
section within five business days of the transmission of the 698
request for evidence. 699
(3) If a request is ultimately denied, in part or in 700
whole, the public office or the person responsible for the 701
requested public record shall provide the requester with an 702
explanation, including legal authority, setting forth why the 703
request was denied. If the initial request was provided in 704
writing, the explanation also shall be provided to the requester 705
in writing. The explanation shall not preclude the public office 706
or the person responsible for the requested public record from 707
relying upon additional reasons or legal authority in defending 708
an action commenced under division (C) of this section. 709
(4) Unless specifically required or authorized by state or 710
federal law or in accordance with division (B) of this section, 711
no public office or person responsible for public records may 712
limit or condition the availability of public records by 713
requiring disclosure of the requester's identity or the intended 714
use of the requested public record. Any requirement that the 715
requester disclose the requester's identity or the intended use 716
of the requested public record constitutes a denial of the 717
request. 718

H. B. No. 314 Page 26
As Introduced
(5) A public office or person responsible for public 719
records may ask a requester to make the request in writing, may 720
ask for the requester's identity, and may inquire about the 721
intended use of the information requested, but may do so only 722
after disclosing to the requester that a written request is not 723
mandatory, that the requester may decline to reveal the 724
requester's identity or the intended use, and when a written 725
request or disclosure of the identity or intended use would 726
benefit the requester by enhancing the ability of the public 727
office or person responsible for public records to identify, 728
locate, or deliver the public records sought by the requester. 729
(6)(6)(a) If any person requests a copy of a public record 730
in accordance with division (B) of this section, the public 731
office or person responsible for the public record may require 732
the requester to pay in advance the cost involved in providing 733
the copy of the public record in accordance with the choice made 734
by the requester under this division. If the request is 735
voluminous and it is therefore reasonable to do so, the public 736
office or person responsible for the public record may engage a 737
private contractor to respond to the request, including making 738
any required redactions, on behalf of the public office or 739
person. The public office or person responsible for the public 740
record may include the cost of the contractor's services in 741
calculating the cost involved in providing the copy of the 742
public record. 743
(b) The public office or the person responsible for the 744
public record shall permit the requester to choose to have the 745
public record duplicated upon paper, upon the same medium upon 746
which the public office or person responsible for the public 747
record keeps it, or upon any other medium upon which the public 748
office or person responsible for the public record determines 749

H. B. No. 314 Page 27
As Introduced
that it reasonably can be duplicated as an integral part of the 750
normal operations of the public office or person responsible for 751
the public record. When the requester makes a choice under this 752
division, the public office or person responsible for the public 753
record shall provide a copy of it in accordance with the choice 754
made by the requester. Nothing 755
(c) Nothing in this section requires a public office or 756
person responsible for the public record to allow the requester 757
of a copy of the public record to make the copies of the public 758
record. 759
(7)(a) Upon a request made in accordance with division (B) 760
of this section and subject to division (B)(6) of this section, 761
a public office or person responsible for public records shall 762
transmit a copy of a public record to any person by United 763
States mail or by any other means of delivery or transmission 764
within a reasonable period of time after receiving the request 765
for the copy. The public office or person responsible for the 766
public record may require the person making the request to pay 767
in advance the cost of postage if the copy is transmitted by 768
United States mail or the cost of delivery if the copy is 769
transmitted other than by United States mail, and to pay in 770
advance the costs incurred for other supplies used in the 771
mailing, delivery, or transmission. 772
(b) Any public office may adopt a policy and procedures 773
that it will follow in transmitting, within a reasonable period 774
of time after receiving a request, copies of public records by 775
United States mail or by any other means of delivery or 776
transmission pursuant to division (B)(7) of this section. A 777
public office that adopts a policy and procedures under division 778
(B)(7) of this section shall comply with them in performing its 779

duties under that division. 780
(c) In any policy and procedures adopted under division 781
(B)(7) of this section: 782
(i) A public office may limit the number of records 783
requested by a person that the office will physically deliver by 784
United States mail or by another delivery service to ten per 785
month, unless the person certifies to the office in writing that 786
the person does not intend to use or forward the requested 787
records, or the information contained in them, for commercial 788
purposes; 789
(ii) A public office that chooses to provide some or all 790
of its public records on a web site that is fully accessible to 791
and searchable by members of the public at all times, other than 792
during acts of God outside the public office's control or 793
maintenance, and that charges no fee to search, access, 794
download, or otherwise receive records provided on the web site, 795
may limit to ten per month the number of records requested by a 796
person that the office will deliver in a digital format, unless 797
the requested records are not provided on the web site and 798
unless the person certifies to the office in writing that the 799
person does not intend to use or forward the requested records, 800
or the information contained in them, for commercial purposes. 801
(iii) For purposes of division (B)(7) of this section, 802
"commercial" shall be narrowly construed and does not include 803
reporting or gathering news, reporting or gathering information 804
to assist citizen oversight or understanding of the operation or 805

to obtain a copy of any public record concerning a criminal 813
investigation or prosecution or concerning what would be a 814
criminal investigation or prosecution if the subject of the 815
investigation or prosecution were an adult, unless the request 816
to inspect or to obtain a copy of the record is for the purpose 817
of acquiring information that is subject to release as a public 818
record under this section and the judge who imposed the sentence 819
or made the adjudication with respect to the person, or the 820
judge's successor in office, finds that the information sought 821
in the public record is necessary to support what appears to be 822
a justiciable claim of the person. As used in this division, 823
"public record concerning a criminal investigation or 824
prosecution or concerning what would be a criminal investigation 825
or prosecution if the subject of the investigation were an 826
adult" includes, but is not limited to, personnel files and 827
payroll and attendance records of designated public service 828
workers. 829
(b) A court order issued under division (B)(2)(c) of this 830
section permits the public office or the person responsible for 831
public records to deny the request. 832

journalist's name and title and the name and address of the 844
journalist's employer and shall state that disclosure of the 845
information sought would be in the public interest. 846
(b) Division (B)(9)(a) of this section also applies to 847
journalist requests for: 848

knows or has reason to believe is a public defender to provide 878
documentary evidence sufficient to prove that the requested 879
records relate to a matter that is within the scope of the 880
requester's employment with a public defender's office or 881
selection or appointment under section 120.33 of the Revised 882

day period. Upon the expiration of the three-day period, the 907
person allegedly aggrieved may, subject to the requirements of 908
division (C)(2) of this section, do only one of the following, 909
and not both: 910
(a) File a complaint with the clerk of the court of claims 911
or the clerk of the court of common pleas under section 2743.75 912
of the Revised Code; 913
(b) Commence a mandamus action to obtain a judgment that 914
orders the public office or the person responsible for the 915
public record to comply with division (B) of this section, that 916
awards court costs and reasonable attorney's fees to the person 917
that instituted the mandamus action, and, if applicable, that 918
includes an order fixing statutory damages under division (C)(3) 919
of this section. The mandamus action may be commenced in the 920
court of common pleas of the county in which division (B) of 921
this section allegedly was not complied with, in the supreme 922
court pursuant to its original jurisdiction under Section 2 of 923
Article IV, Ohio Constitution, or in the court of appeals for 924
the appellate district in which division (B) of this section 925
allegedly was not complied with pursuant to its original 926
jurisdiction under Section 3 of Article IV, Ohio Constitution. 927

(2) Upon filing a complaint or mandamus action with a 928
court under divisions (C)(1)(a) or (b) of this section, a person 929
allegedly aggrieved shall file with the court, in conjunction 930
with the person's complaint or petition, a written affirmation 931
stating that the person properly transmitted a complaint to the 932
public office or person responsible for public records, the 933
failure alleged in the complaint has not been cured or otherwise 934
resolved to the person's satisfaction, and that the complaint 935
was transmitted to the public office or person responsible for 936
public records at least three business days before the filing of 937
the suit. If the person fails to file an affirmation pursuant to 938
this division, the suit shall be dismissed. 939
(3) If a requester transmits a written request by hand 940
delivery, electronic submission, or certified mail to inspect or 941
receive copies of any public record in a manner that fairly 942
describes the public record or class of public records to the 943
public office or person responsible for the requested public 944
records, except as otherwise provided in this section, the 945
requester shall be entitled to recover the amount of statutory 946
damages set forth in this division if a court determines that 947
the public office or the person responsible for public records 948
failed to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 949
(B) of this section. Statutory damages are not available 950
pursuant to this section to a person committed to the custody of 951
the department of rehabilitation and correction or the United 952
States bureau of prisons, or a child committed to the department 953
of youth services as permitted in Chapter 2152. of the Revised 954
Code. 955
The amount of statutory damages shall be fixed at one 956
hundred dollars for each business day during which the public 957
office or person responsible for the requested public records 958

H. B. No. 314 Page 34
As Introduced
failed to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 959
(B) of this section, beginning with the day on which the 960
requester files a mandamus action to recover statutory damages, 961
up to a maximum of one thousand dollars. The award of statutory 962
damages shall not be construed as a penalty, but as compensation 963
for injury arising from lost use of the requested information. 964
The existence of this injury shall be conclusively presumed. The 965
award of statutory damages shall be in addition to all other 966
remedies authorized by this section. 967
The court may reduce an award of statutory damages or not 968
award statutory damages if the court determines both of the 969
following: 970
(a) That, based on the ordinary application of statutory 971
law and case law as it existed at the time of the conduct or 972
threatened conduct of the public office or person responsible 973
for the requested public records that allegedly constitutes a 974
failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 975
(B) of this section and that was the basis of the mandamus 976
action, a well-informed public office or person responsible for 977
the requested public records reasonably would believe that the 978
conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or person 979
responsible for the requested public records did not constitute 980
a failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with 981
division (B) of this section; 982
(b) That a well-informed public office or person 983
responsible for the requested public records reasonably would 984
believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of the public 985
office or person responsible for the requested public records 986
would serve the public policy that underlies the authority that 987
is asserted as permitting that conduct or threatened conduct. 988

(4) In a mandamus action filed under division (C)(1) of 989
this section, the following apply: 990
(a)(i) If the court orders the public office or the person 991
responsible for the public record to comply with division (B) of 992
this section, the court shall determine and award to the relator 993
all court costs, which shall be construed as remedial and not 994
punitive. 995
(ii) If the court makes a determination described in 996
division (C)(4)(b)(iii) of this section, the court shall 997
determine and award to the relator all court costs, which shall 998
be construed as remedial and not punitive. 999
(b) If the court renders a judgment that orders the public 1000
office or the person responsible for the public record to comply 1001
with division (B) of this section or if the court determines any 1002
of the following, the court may award reasonable attorney's fees 1003
to the relator, subject to division (C)(5) of this section: 1004
(i) The public office or the person responsible for the 1005
public records failed to respond affirmatively or negatively to 1006
the public records request in accordance with the time allowed 1007
under division (B) of this section. 1008
(ii) The public office or the person responsible for the 1009
public records promised to permit the relator to inspect or 1010
receive copies of the public records requested within a 1011
specified period of time but failed to fulfill that promise 1012
within that specified period of time. 1013
(iii) The public office or the person responsible for the 1014
public records acted in bad faith when the office or person 1015
voluntarily made the public records available to the relator for 1016
the first time after the relator commenced the mandamus action, 1017

H. B. No. 314 Page 36
As Introduced
but before the court issued any order concluding whether or not 1018
the public office or person was required to comply with division 1019
(B) of this section. No discovery may be conducted on the issue 1020
of the alleged bad faith of the public office or person 1021
responsible for the public records. This division shall not be 1022
construed as creating a presumption that the public office or 1023
the person responsible for the public records acted in bad faith 1024
when the office or person voluntarily made the public records 1025
available to the relator for the first time after the relator 1026
commenced the mandamus action, but before the court issued any 1027
order described in this division. 1028
(c) The court shall not award attorney's fees to the 1029
relator if the court determines both of the following: 1030
(i) That, based on the ordinary application of statutory 1031
law and case law as it existed at the time of the conduct or 1032
threatened conduct of the public office or person responsible 1033
for the requested public records that allegedly constitutes a 1034
failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with division 1035
(B) of this section and that was the basis of the mandamus 1036
action, a well-informed public office or person responsible for 1037
the requested public records reasonably would believe that the 1038
conduct or threatened conduct of the public office or person 1039
responsible for the requested public records did not constitute 1040
a failure to comply with an obligation in accordance with 1041
division (B) of this section; 1042
(ii) That a well-informed public office or person 1043
responsible for the requested public records reasonably would 1044
believe that the conduct or threatened conduct of the public 1045
office or person responsible for the requested public records 1046
would serve the public policy that underlies the authority that 1047

H. B. No. 314 Page 37
As Introduced
is asserted as permitting that conduct or threatened conduct. 1048
(5) All of the following apply to any award of reasonable 1049
attorney's fees awarded under division (C)(4)(b) of this 1050
section: 1051
(a) The fees shall be construed as remedial and not 1052
punitive. 1053
(b) The fees awarded shall not exceed the total of the 1054
reasonable attorney's fees incurred before the public record was 1055
made available to the relator and the fees described in division 1056
(C)(5)(c) of this section. 1057
(c) Reasonable attorney's fees shall include reasonable 1058
fees incurred to produce proof of the reasonableness and amount 1059
of the fees and to otherwise litigate entitlement to the fees. 1060
(d) The court may reduce the amount of fees awarded if the 1061
court determines that, given the factual circumstances involved 1062
with the specific public records request, an alternative means 1063
should have been pursued to more effectively and efficiently 1064
resolve the dispute that was subject to the mandamus action 1065
filed under division (C)(1) of this section. 1066
(6) If the court does not issue a writ of mandamus under 1067
division (C) of this section and the court determines at that 1068
time that the bringing of the mandamus action was frivolous 1069
conduct as defined in division (A) of section 2323.51 of the 1070
Revised Code, the court may award to the public office all court 1071
costs, expenses, and reasonable attorney's fees, as determined 1072
by the court. 1073
(D) Chapter 1347. of the Revised Code does not limit the 1074
provisions of this section. 1075

H. B. No. 314 Page 38
As Introduced
(E)(1) To ensure that all employees of public offices are 1076
appropriately educated about a public office's obligations under 1077
division (B) of this section, all elected officials or their 1078
appropriate designees shall attend training approved by the 1079
attorney general as provided in section 109.43 of the Revised 1080
Code. A future official may satisfy the requirements of this 1081
division by attending the training before taking office, 1082
provided that the future official may not send a designee in the 1083
future official's place. 1084
(2) All public offices shall adopt a public records policy 1085
in compliance with this section for responding to public records 1086
requests. In adopting a public records policy under this 1087
division, a public office may obtain guidance from the model 1088
public records policy developed and provided to the public 1089
office by the attorney general under section 109.43 of the 1090
Revised Code. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the 1091
policy may not limit the number of public records that the 1092
public office will make available to a single person, may not 1093
limit the number of public records that it will make available 1094
during a fixed period of time, and may not establish a fixed 1095
period of time before it will respond to a request for 1096
inspection or copying of public records, unless that period is 1097
less than eight hours. 1098
The public office shall distribute the public records 1099
policy adopted by the public office under this division to the 1100
employee of the public office who is the records custodian or 1101
records manager or otherwise has custody of the records of that 1102
office. The public office shall require that employee to 1103
acknowledge receipt of the copy of the public records policy. 1104
The public office shall create a poster that describes its 1105
public records policy and shall post the poster in a conspicuous 1106

H. B. No. 314 Page 39
As Introduced
place in the public office and in all locations where the public 1107
office has branch offices. The public office may post its public 1108
records policy on the internet web site of the public office if 1109
the public office maintains an internet web site. A public 1110
office that has established a manual or handbook of its general 1111
policies and procedures for all employees of the public office 1112
shall include the public records policy of the public office in 1113
the manual or handbook. 1114
(F)(1) The bureau of motor vehicles may adopt rules 1115
pursuant to Chapter 119. of the Revised Code to reasonably limit 1116
the number of bulk commercial special extraction requests made 1117
by a person for the same records or for updated records during a 1118
calendar year. The rules may include provisions for charges to 1119
be made for bulk commercial special extraction requests for the 1120
actual cost of the bureau, plus special extraction costs, plus 1121
ten per cent. The bureau may charge for expenses for redacting 1122
information, the release of which is prohibited by law. 1123
(2) As used in division (F)(1) of this section: 1124
(a) "Actual cost" means the cost of depleted supplies, 1125
records storage media costs, actual mailing and alternative 1126
delivery costs, or other transmitting costs, and any direct 1127
equipment operating and maintenance costs, including actual 1128
costs paid to private contractors for copying services. 1129
(b) "Bulk commercial special extraction request" means a 1130
request for copies of a record for information in a format other 1131
than the format already available, or information that cannot be 1132
extracted without examination of all items in a records series, 1133
class of records, or database by a person who intends to use or 1134
forward the copies for surveys, marketing, solicitation, or 1135
resale for commercial purposes. "Bulk commercial special 1136

H. B. No. 314 Page 40
As Introduced
extraction request" does not include a request by a person who 1137
gives assurance to the bureau that the person making the request 1138
does not intend to use or forward the requested copies for 1139
surveys, marketing, solicitation, or resale for commercial 1140
purposes. 1141
(c) "Commercial" means profit-seeking production, buying, 1142
or selling of any good, service, or other product. 1143
(d) "Special extraction costs" means the cost of the time 1144
spent by the lowest paid employee competent to perform the task, 1145
the actual amount paid to outside private contractors employed 1146
by the bureau, or the actual cost incurred to create computer 1147
programs to make the special extraction. "Special extraction 1148
costs" include any charges paid to a public agency for computer 1149
or records services. 1150
(3) For purposes of divisions (F)(1) and (2) of this 1151
section, "surveys, marketing, solicitation, or resale for 1152
commercial purposes" shall be narrowly construed and does not 1153
include reporting or gathering news, reporting or gathering 1154
information to assist citizen oversight or understanding of the 1155
operation or activities of government, or nonprofit educational 1156
research. 1157
(G) A request by a defendant, counsel of a defendant, or 1158
any agent of a defendant in a criminal action that public 1159
records related to that action be made available under this 1160
section shall be considered a demand for discovery pursuant to 1161
the Criminal Rules, except to the extent that the Criminal Rules 1162
plainly indicate a contrary intent. The defendant, counsel of 1163
the defendant, or agent of the defendant making a request under 1164
this division shall serve a copy of the request on the 1165
prosecuting attorney, director of law, or other chief legal 1166

H. B. No. 314 Page 41

officer responsible for prosecuting the action. 1167
(H)(1) Any portion of a body-worn camera or dashboard 1168
camera recording described in divisions (A)(17)(b) to (h) of 1169
this section may be released by consent of the subject of the 1170
recording or a representative of that person, as specified in 1171
those divisions, only if either of the following applies: 1172
(a) The recording will not be used in connection with any 1173
probable or pending criminal proceedings; 1174
(b) The recording has been used in connection with a 1175
criminal proceeding that was dismissed or for which a judgment 1176
has been entered pursuant to Rule 32 of the Rules of Criminal 1177
Procedure, and will not be used again in connection with any 1178
probable or pending criminal proceedings. 1179
(2) If a public office denies a request to release a 1180
restricted portion of a body-worn camera or dashboard camera 1181
recording, as defined in division (A)(17) of this section, any 1182
person may file a mandamus action pursuant to this section or a 1183
complaint with the clerk of the court of claims pursuant to 1184
section 2743.75 of the Revised Code, requesting the court to 1185
order the release of all or portions of the recording. If the 1186
court considering the request determines that the filing 1187
articulates by clear and convincing evidence that the public 1188
interest in the recording substantially outweighs privacy 1189
interests and other interests asserted to deny release, the 1190
court shall order the public office to release the recording. 1191
Section 2. That existing section 149.43 of the Revised 1192
Code is hereby repealed. 1193
Section 3. Section 149.43 of the Revised Code is presented 1194
