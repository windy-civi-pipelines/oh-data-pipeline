action because of the arrest or taking into custody or the 1449
response. 1450
(H) The judgment rendered by the court under this chapter 1451
shall not impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily 1452
imposed by conviction of a crime in that the child is not a 1453
criminal by reason of the adjudication, and no child shall be 1454
charged with or convicted of a crime in any court except as 1455
provided by this chapter. The disposition of a child under the 1456
judgment rendered or any evidence given in court shall not 1457
operate to disqualify a child in any future civil service 1458
examination, appointment, or application. Evidence of a judgment 1459
rendered and the disposition of a child under the judgment is 1460
not admissible to impeach the credibility of the child in any 1461

be imprisoned unless the court determines on the record either 3023
of the following: 3024

offense that is a felony of the third, fourth, or fifth degree 3034
may require that the offender be assessed by a properly 3035
credentialed professional within a specified period of time. The 3036
court shall require the professional to file a written 3037
assessment of the offender with the court. If the offender is 3038
eligible for a community control sanction and after considering 3039
the written assessment, the court may impose a community control 3040
sanction that includes addiction services and recovery supports 3041
included in a community-based continuum of care established 3042
under section 340.032 of the Revised Code. If the court imposes 3043

the fee collected into the state treasury, with half of that 6335
amount credited to the attorney general reimbursement fund 6336
created by section 109.11 of the Revised Code. If the applicant 6337

compelled by the court to destroy, delete, or erase those 6379
records so that the records are permanently irretrievable. These 6380
records may only be disclosed or provided to law enforcement for 6381
the limited purpose of determining an individual's qualification 6382
or disqualification for employment in law enforcement. 6383

technician committed such act, or if the registered nurse, 7899
licensed practical nurse, or dialysis technician does not 7900
request an adjudication, the board shall reinstate its action; 7901

recidivism for the prisoner. If a prisoner is permitted under 8674

Revised Code; 1415

for purposes of Chapter 2950. of the Revised Code. 1427

licensing, or education to any person or to any department, 1431
agency, or other instrumentality of the state or of any of its 1432

any arrest, taking into custody, complaint, indictment, 1434
information, trial, hearing, adjudication, or correctional 1435
supervision, the records of which have been sealed pursuant to 1436
section 2151.356 of the Revised Code and the release, 1437
dissemination, or making available of which is not expressly 1438
permitted by this section. Whoever violates this division is 1439
guilty of divulging confidential information, a misdemeanor of 1440
the fourth degree. 1441

arrest or taking into custody for which the records were sealed. 1445
If an inquiry is made in violation of this division, the person 1446
may respond as if the sealed arrest or taking into custody did 1447
not occur, and the person shall not be subject to any adverse 1448
action because of the arrest or taking into custody or the 1449
response. 1450
(H) The judgment rendered by the court under this chapter 1451
shall not impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily 1452
imposed by conviction of a crime in that the child is not a 1453
criminal by reason of the adjudication, and no child shall be 1454
charged with or convicted of a crime in any court except as 1455
provided by this chapter. The disposition of a child under the 1456
judgment rendered or any evidence given in court shall not 1457
operate to disqualify a child in any future civil service 1458
examination, appointment, or application. Evidence of a judgment 1459
rendered and the disposition of a child under the judgment is 1460
not admissible to impeach the credibility of the child in any 1461
action or proceeding. Otherwise, the disposition of a child 1462
under the judgment rendered or any evidence given in court is 1463

Sub. H. B. No. 5 Page 50
As Reported by the House Judiciary Committee
admissible as evidence for or against the child in any action or 1464
proceeding in any court in accordance with the Rules of Evidence 1465
and also may be considered by any court as to the matter of 1466
sentence or to the granting of probation, and a court may 1467

and protect the public from future crime, because the applicable 2994
factors under section 2929.12 of the Revised Code indicating a 2995
lesser likelihood of recidivism outweigh the applicable factors 2996
under that section indicating a greater likelihood of 2997

was less serious than conduct normally constituting the offense 3003

sanction imposed for the offense solely by reason of producing 3020
positive results on a drug test, the court, as punishment for 3021
the violation of the sanction, shall not order that the offender 3022
be imprisoned unless the court determines on the record either 3023
of the following: 3024

felony to participate in a drug treatment program, in a drug 3026
education program, or in narcotics anonymous or a similar 3027

(3) A court that sentences an offender for a drug abuse 3033
offense that is a felony of the third, fourth, or fifth degree 3034
may require that the offender be assessed by a properly 3035
credentialed professional within a specified period of time. The 3036
court shall require the professional to file a written 3037
assessment of the offender with the court. If the offender is 3038
eligible for a community control sanction and after considering 3039
the written assessment, the court may impose a community control 3040
sanction that includes addiction services and recovery supports 3041
included in a community-based continuum of care established 3042
under section 340.032 of the Revised Code. If the court imposes 3043
addiction services and recovery supports as a community control 3044
sanction, the court shall direct the level and type of addiction 3045
services and recovery supports after considering the assessment 3046
and recommendation of community addiction services providers. 3047

2923.02 of the Revised Code, the sentencing court shall consider 3325

in relation to an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty 3330
to an attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the 3331
penalty is determined by the amount or number of unit doses of 3332

sentencing court shall consider the factors applicable to the 3334
felony category that the drug abuse offense attempted would be 3335
if that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved 3336
an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance 3337
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance 3338
amounts than was involved in the attempt. 3339

Revised Code that was attempted, the offender would have been 3787
subject to a sentence of life imprisonment or life imprisonment 3788

elects to consider an offender's request or the offender alleges 4974
that drug or alcohol usage by the offender was a factor leading 4975
to the criminal offense with which the offender is charged, the 4976

2907.21 of the Revised Code, whichever is applicable, was a 5047
factor leading to the criminal offense with which the offender 5048
is charged, intervention in lieu of conviction would not demean 5049
the seriousness of the offense, and intervention would 5050
substantially reduce the likelihood of any future criminal 5051
activity. 5052
(7) The alleged victim of the offense was not sixty-five 5053

(10) The offender is not charged with an offense that 5063
would result in the offender being disqualified under Chapter 5064

vehicle or would subject the offender to any other sanction 5066
under that chapter. 5067
(C) At the conclusion of a hearing held pursuant to 5068
division (A) of this section, the court shall determine whether 5069
the offender will be granted intervention in lieu of conviction. 5070
In making this determination, the court shall presume that 5071
intervention in lieu of conviction is appropriate. If the court 5072
finds under this division and division (B) of this section that 5073
the offender is eligible for intervention in lieu of conviction, 5074
the court shall grant the offender's request unless the court 5075
finds specific reasons to believe that the candidate's 5076
participation in intervention in lieu of conviction would be 5077
inappropriate. 5078
If the court denies an eligible offender's request for 5079
intervention in lieu of conviction, the court shall state the 5080
reasons for the denial, with particularity, in a written entry. 5081
If the court grants the offender's request, the court 5082
shall accept the offender's plea of guilty and waiver of the 5083
defendant's right to a speedy trial, the preliminary hearing, 5084

recovery support services, and to submit to regular random 5116
testing for drug and alcohol use and may include any other 5117
treatment terms and conditions, or terms and conditions similar 5118
to community control sanctions, which may include community 5119

least one year, but not more than five years, from the date on 5126
which the court granted the order of intervention in lieu of 5127
conviction, the requirement that the offender participate in 5128
treatment and recovery support services, and all other terms and 5129
conditions ordered by the court, the court shall dismiss the 5130
proceedings against the offender. Successful completion of the 5131
intervention plan and period of abstinence under this section 5132
shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a criminal 5133
conviction for purposes of any disqualification or disability 5134
imposed by law and upon conviction of a crime, and the court may 5135
order the sealing or expungement of records related to the 5136
offense in question, as a dismissal of the charges, in the 5137
manner provided in sections 2953.31, 2953.321, 2953.323, 5138

(F) If the court grants an offender's request for 5141
intervention in lieu of conviction and the offender fails to 5142
comply with any term or condition imposed as part of the 5143
intervention plan for the offender, the supervising authority 5144
for the offender promptly shall advise the court of this 5145
failure, and the court shall hold a hearing to determine whether 5146
the offender failed to comply with any term or condition imposed 5147
as part of the plan. If the court determines that the offender 5148
has failed to comply with any of those terms and conditions, it 5149
may continue the offender on intervention in lieu of conviction, 5150
continue the offender on intervention in lieu of conviction with 5151
additional terms, conditions, and sanctions, or enter a finding 5152

application specified by the victim in the objection; 6255
(f) Weigh the interests of the applicant in having the 6256
records pertaining to the applicant's conviction or bail 6257
forfeiture sealed or expunged against the legitimate needs, if 6258
any, of the government to maintain those records; 6259
(g) Consider the oral or written statement of any victim, 6260
victim's representative, and victim's attorney, if applicable; 6261

(ii) The facts and circumstances of the offense; 6269
(iii) The cessation or continuation of criminal behavior; 6270
(iv) The education and employment of the offender; 6271
(v) Any other circumstances that may relate to the 6272
offender's rehabilitation. 6273

applicant for sealing or expungement has two or three 6275
convictions that result from the same indictment, information, 6276
or complaint, from the same plea of guilty, or from the same 6277
official proceeding, and result from related criminal acts that 6278
were committed within a three-month period but do not result 6279
from the same act or from offenses committed at the same time, 6280
in making its determination, the court initially shall determine 6281
whether it is not in the public interest for the two or three 6282
convictions to be counted as one conviction. If the court 6283
determines that it is not in the public interest for the two or 6284
three convictions to be counted as one conviction, the court 6285
shall determine whether, when counting the convictions 6286
individually, the applicant is pursuing sealing or expunging a 6287
conviction that is prohibited under division (A) of this section 6288
2953.311 of the Revised Code. 6289
(2) If the court determines, after complying with division 6290

sealing or expunging a conviction of an offense that is 6292
prohibited under division (A) of this section 2953.311 of the 6293
Revise Code or that the forfeiture of bail was agreed to by the 6294

applicant and the prosecutor in the case, that the application 6295
was made at the time specified in division (B)(1)(a) or (b)(A) 6296
(1) or division (B)(2)(a) or (b)(A)(2) of this section that is 6297
applicable with respect to the application and the subject 6298
offense, that no criminal proceeding is pending against the 6299
applicant, that the interests of the applicant in having the 6300
records pertaining to the applicant's conviction or bail 6301
forfeiture sealed or expunged are not outweighed by any 6302
legitimate governmental needs to maintain those records, and 6303
that the rehabilitation of the applicant has been attained to 6304
the satisfaction of the court, both of the following apply: 6305
(a) The court, except as provided in division (D)(4) or 6306
(5)(C)(4) of this section or division (D), (F), or (G) of 6307
section 2953.34 of the Revised Code, shall order all official 6308
records of the case that pertain to the conviction or bail 6309
forfeiture sealed if the application was for sealing or expunged 6310
if the application was for expungement and, except as provided 6311
in division (C) of section 2953.34 of the Revised Code, all 6312
index references to the case that pertain to the conviction or 6313
bail forfeiture deleted and, in the case of bail forfeitures, 6314
shall dismiss the charges in the case. 6315
(b) The proceedings in the case that pertain to the 6316
conviction or bail forfeiture shall be considered not to have 6317
occurred and the conviction or bail forfeiture of the person who 6318
is the subject of the proceedings shall be sealed if the 6319
application was for sealing or expunged if the application was 6320
for expungement, except that upon conviction of a subsequent 6321
offense, a sealed record of prior conviction or bail forfeiture 6322
may be considered by the court in determining the sentence or 6323
other appropriate disposition, including the relief provided for 6324
in sections 2953.31, 2953.32, and 2953.34 of the Revised Code. 6325

section, the applicant, unless the applicant presents a poverty 6329
affidavit showing that the applicant is indigent, shall pay an 6330
application fee of fifty dollars and may pay a local court fee 6331
of not more than fifty dollars, regardless of the number of 6332
records the application requests to have sealed or expunged. If 6333
the applicant pays a fee, the court shall pay three-fifths of 6334
the fee collected into the state treasury, with half of that 6335
amount credited to the attorney general reimbursement fund 6336
created by section 109.11 of the Revised Code. If the applicant 6337
pays a fee, the court shall pay two-fifths of the fee collected 6338
into the county general revenue fund if the sealed or expunged 6339
conviction or bail forfeiture was pursuant to a state statute, 6340
or into the general revenue fund of the municipal corporation 6341
involved if the sealed or expunged conviction or bail forfeiture 6342
was pursuant to a municipal ordinance. 6343
(4) If the court orders the official records pertaining to 6344
the case sealed or expunged, the court shall do one of the 6345
following: 6346
(a) If the applicant was fingerprinted at the time of 6347
arrest or under section 109.60 of the Revised Code and the 6348
record of the applicant's fingerprints was provided to the court 6349
under division (C)(B) of this section, forward a copy of the 6350
sealing or expungement order and the record of the applicant's 6351
fingerprints to the bureau of criminal identification and 6352
investigation. 6353
(b) If the applicant was not fingerprinted at the time of 6354
arrest or under section 109.60 of the Revised Code, or the 6355

Sub. H. B. No. 5 Page 215
As Reported by the House Judiciary Committee
record of the applicant's fingerprints was not provided to the 6356
court under division (C)(B) of this section, but fingerprinting 6357
was required for the offense, order the applicant to appear 6358
before a sheriff to have the applicant's fingerprints taken 6359
according to the fingerprint system of identification on the 6360
forms furnished by the superintendent of the bureau of criminal 6361
identification and investigation. The sheriff shall forward the 6362
applicant's fingerprints to the court. The court shall forward 6363
the applicant's fingerprints and a copy of the sealing or 6364
expungement order to the bureau of criminal identification and 6365
investigation. 6366
(c) Failure of the court to order fingerprints at the time 6367
of sealing or expungement does not constitute a reversible 6368
error. 6369
(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Revised 6370
Code to the contrary, when the bureau of criminal identification 6371
and investigation receives notice from a court that the record 6372
of a conviction or bail forfeiture has been expunged under this 6373
section, the bureau of criminal identification and investigation 6374
shall maintain a record of the expunged conviction record for 6375
the limited purpose of determining an individual's qualification 6376
or disqualification for employment in law enforcement. The 6377
bureau of criminal identification and investigation shall not be 6378
compelled by the court to destroy, delete, or erase those 6379
records so that the records are permanently irretrievable. These 6380
records may only be disclosed or provided to law enforcement for 6381
the limited purpose of determining an individual's qualification 6382
or disqualification for employment in law enforcement. 6383
When any other entity other than the bureau of criminal 6384
identification and investigation receives notice from a court 6385

Sub. H. B. No. 5 Page 216
As Reported by the House Judiciary Committee
that the record of a conviction or bail forfeiture has been 6386
expunged under this section, the entity shall destroy, delete, 6387

electronic form or characteristic so that the record is 6389
permanently irretrievable. 6390

eligible for sealing. If the court's regular probation officer, 6411
a state probation officer, or the department of probation of the 6412
county determines that a person's record of conviction or 6413
dismissed complaint, indictment, or information is eligible for 6414

the underlying case. The letter shall state that the subject of 6428
the proceeding's record of conviction or dismissed complaint, 6429
indictment, or information is presumed to be eligible for 6430
sealing. When the sentencing court sends the letter to the 6431

victim or victim's representative, if applicable, shall specify 6482
in the objection the reasons for believing a denial of the 6483

of the subject offense; 6493
(b) The applicant's dismissed complaint, indictment, or 6494

in the objection; 6508
(4) If the victim or victim's representative has filed an 6509
objection in accordance with division (B)(3) of this section, 6510

objection; 6513
(5) Weigh the interests of the applicant in having the 6514
record of conviction or dismissed complaint, indictment, or 6515

government to maintain those records. 6517
(D) If the court, after complying with division (C) of 6518

officer or county department of probation that the court directs 6614
to make inquiries and written reports as the court requires 6615
concerning the applicant shall determine whether or not the 6616
applicant was fingerprinted at the time of arrest or under 6617

(a) Determine whether the applicant is pursuing expunging 6631
a conviction of an offense that is prohibited under section 6632
2953.311 of the Revised Code or whether the forfeiture of bail 6633
was agreed to by the applicant and the prosecutor in the case, 6634

(e) If the victim objected, pursuant to the Ohio 6647
Constitution, consider the reasons against granting the 6648
application specified by the victim in the objection; 6649
(f) Weigh the interests of the applicant in having the 6650
records pertaining to the applicant's conviction or bail 6651
forfeiture expunged against the legitimate needs, if any, of the 6652
government to maintain those records; 6653
(g) Consider the oral or written statement of any victim, 6654
victim's representative, and victim's attorney, if applicable; 6655

described in division (A)(3) of section 2953.36 of the Revised 6657
Code as it existed prior to April 4, 2023, determine whether the 6658
offender has been rehabilitated to a satisfactory degree. In 6659
making the determination, the court may consider all of the 6660
following: 6661
(i) The age of the offender; 6662
(ii) The facts and circumstances of the offense; 6663
(iii) The cessation or continuation of criminal behavior; 6664
(iv) The education and employment of the offender; 6665
(v) Any other circumstances that may relate to the 6666
offender's rehabilitation. 6667
(i) If the court is required to determine whether an 6668
applicant for expungement has two or three convictions that 6669
result from the same indictment, information, or complaint, from 6670
the same plea of guilty, or from the same official proceeding, 6671
and result from related criminal acts that were committed within 6672
a three-month period but do not result from the same act or from 6673
offenses committed at the same time, in making its 6674
determination, the court initially shall determine whether it is 6675
not in the public interest for the two or three convictions to 6676
be counted as one conviction. If the court determines that it is 6677
not in the public interest for the two or three convictions to 6678
be counted as one conviction, the court shall determine whether, 6679
when counting the convictions individually, the applicant is 6680
pursuing expunging a conviction that is prohibited under section 6681
2953.311 of the Revised Code. 6682
(2) If the court determines, after complying with division 6683

section 2953.311 of the Revised Code or that the forfeiture of 6686
bail was agreed to by the applicant and the prosecutor in the 6687
case, that the application was made at the time specified in 6688
division (A)(1) or (2) of this section that is applicable with 6689
respect to the application and the subject offense, that no 6690
criminal proceeding is pending against the applicant, that the 6691
interests of the applicant in having the records pertaining to 6692
the applicant's conviction or bail forfeiture expunged are not 6693
outweighed by any legitimate governmental needs to maintain 6694
those records, and that the rehabilitation of the applicant has 6695
been attained to the satisfaction of the court, both of the 6696
following apply: 6697
(a) The court, except as provided in division (C)(4) of 6698
this section or division (D), (F), or (G) of section 2953.34 of 6699
the Revised Code, shall order all official records of the case 6700
that pertain to the conviction or bail forfeiture expunged and, 6701
except as provided in division (C) of section 2953.34 of the 6702
Revised Code, all index references to the case that pertain to 6703
the conviction or bail forfeiture deleted and, in the case of 6704
bail forfeitures, shall dismiss the charges in the case. 6705
(b) The proceedings in the case that pertain to the 6706
conviction or bail forfeiture shall be considered not to have 6707

showing that the applicant is indigent, shall pay an application 6714

Sub. H. B. No. 5 Page 227
As Reported by the House Judiciary Committee
fee of fifty dollars and may pay a local court fee of not more 6715
than fifty dollars, regardless of the number of records the 6716
application requests to have expunged. If the applicant pays a 6717
fee, the court shall pay three-fifths of the fee collected into 6718
the state treasury, with half of that amount credited to the 6719
attorney general reimbursement fund created by section 109.11 of 6720
the Revised Code. If the applicant pays a fee, the court shall 6721
pay two-fifths of the fee collected into the county general 6722
revenue fund if the expunged conviction or bail forfeiture was 6723
pursuant to a state statute, or into the general revenue fund of 6724
the municipal corporation involved if the expunged conviction or 6725
bail forfeiture was pursuant to a municipal ordinance. 6726
(4) If the court orders the official records pertaining to 6727
the case expunged, the court shall do one of the following: 6728
(a) If the applicant was fingerprinted at the time of 6729
arrest or under section 109.60 of the Revised Code and the 6730
record of the applicant's fingerprints was provided to the court 6731
under division (B) of this section, forward a copy of the 6732
expungement order and the record of the applicant's fingerprints 6733
to the bureau of criminal identification and investigation; 6734
(b) If the applicant was not fingerprinted at the time of 6735
arrest or under section 109.60 of the Revised Code, or the 6736
record of the applicant's fingerprints was not provided to the 6737
court under division (B) of this section, but fingerprinting was 6738
required for the offense, order the applicant to appear before a 6739
sheriff to have the applicant's fingerprints taken according to 6740
the fingerprint system of identification on the forms furnished 6741
by the superintendent of the bureau of criminal identification 6742
and investigation. The sheriff shall forward the applicant's 6743
fingerprints to the court. The court shall forward the 6744

Sub. H. B. No. 5 Page 228
As Reported by the House Judiciary Committee
applicant's fingerprints and a copy of the expungement order to 6745
the bureau of criminal identification and investigation. 6746

proceeding is pending against the subject offender, that the 7574

ability to practice is impaired, the board shall suspend the 8150
individual's license or deny the individual's application and 8151
shall require the individual, as a condition for an initial, 8152

the term described in division (A)(4)(a) of this section. 8622
(e) The person is eighteen years of age or older. 8623

uninterrupted participation in the substance use disorder 8628
treatment program established under division (B) of this 8629
section. 8630
(B) The department of rehabilitation and correction shall 8631
establish and operate a program for community-based substance 8632
use disorder treatment for qualified prisoners. The purpose of 8633
the program shall be to provide substance use disorder 8634
assessment and treatment through community treatment providers 8635
to help reduce substance use relapses and recidivism for 8636
qualified prisoners while preparing them for reentry into the 8637
community and improving public safety. 8638
(C)(1) The department shall determine which qualified 8639
prisoners in its custody should be placed in the substance use 8640
disorder treatment program established under division (B) of 8641
this section. The department has full discretion in making that 8642
determination. If the department determines that a qualified 8643
prisoner should be placed in the program, the department may 8644
refer the prisoner to a community treatment provider the 8645
department has approved under division (E) of this section for 8646
participation in the program and transfer the prisoner from the 8647
state correctional institution to the provider's approved and 8648
licensed facility. Except as otherwise provided in division (C) 8649
(3) of this section, no prisoner shall be placed under the 8650
program in any facility other than a facility of a community 8651
treatment provider that has been so approved. If the department 8652
places a prisoner in the program, the prisoner shall receive 8653
credit against the prisoner's prison term for all time served in 8654
the provider's approved and licensed facility and may earn days 8655
of credit under section 2967.193 or 2967.194 of the Revised 8656
Code, but otherwise neither the placement nor the prisoner's 8657
participation in or completion of the program shall result in 8658

Sub. H. B. No. 5 Page 293
As Reported by the House Judiciary Committee
any reduction of the prisoner's prison term. 8659
(2) If the department places a prisoner in the substance 8660
use disorder treatment program, the prisoner does not 8661
satisfactorily participate in the program, and the prisoner has 8662
not served the prisoner's entire prison term, the department may 8663
remove the prisoner from the program and return the prisoner to 8664
a state correctional institution. 8665
(3) If the department places a prisoner in the substance 8666
use disorder treatment program and the prisoner is 8667
satisfactorily participating in the program, the department may 8668
permit the prisoner to reside at a residence approved by the 8669
department if the department determines, with input from the 8670
community treatment provider, that residing at the approved 8671
residence will help the prisoner prepare for reentry into the 8672
community and will help reduce substance use relapses and 8673
recidivism for the prisoner. If a prisoner is permitted under 8674
this division to reside at a residence approved by the 8675
department, the prisoner shall be monitored during the period of 8676
that residence by an electronic monitoring device. 8677
(D)(1) When a prisoner has been placed in the substance 8678
use disorder treatment program established under division (B) of 8679
this section, before the prisoner is released from custody of 8680
the department upon completion of the prisoner's prison term, 8681
the department shall conduct and prepare an evaluation of the 8682
prisoner, the prisoner's participation in the program, and the 8683
prisoner's needs regarding substance use disorder treatment upon 8684
release. Before the prisoner is released from custody of the 8685
department upon completion of the prisoner's prison term, the 8686
parole board or the court acting pursuant to an agreement under 8687
section 2967.29 of the Revised Code shall consider the 8688

Sub. H. B. No. 5 Page 294
As Reported by the House Judiciary Committee
evaluation, in addition to all other information and materials 8689
considered, as follows: 8690
(a) If the prisoner is a prisoner for whom post-release 8691
control is mandatory under section 2967.28 of the Revised Code, 8692
the board or court shall consider it in determining which post- 8693
release control sanction or sanctions to impose upon the 8694
prisoner under that section. 8695
(b) If the prisoner is a prisoner for whom post-release 8696
control is not mandatory under section 2967.28 of the Revised 8697
Code, the board or court shall consider it in determining 8698
whether a post-release control sanction is necessary and, if so, 8699
which post-release control sanction or sanctions to impose upon 8700
the prisoner under that section. 8701
(2) If the department determines that a prisoner it placed 8702
in the substance use disorder treatment program successfully 8703
completed the program and successfully completed a term of post- 8704
release control, if applicable, and if the prisoner submits an 8705
application under section 2953.32, 2953.322, or 2953.323 of the 8706
Revised Code or the prosecutor in the case submits an 8707
application under section 2953.39 of the Revised Code for 8708
sealing or expungement of the record of the conviction, the 8709
director may issue a letter to the court in support of the 8710
application. 8711
(E)(1) The department shall accept applications from 8712
community treatment providers that satisfy the requirement 8713
specified in division (E)(2) of this section and that wish to 8714
participate in the substance use disorder treatment program 8715
established under division (B) of this section, and shall 8716
approve for participation in the program at least four and not 8717
more than eight of the providers that apply. To the extent 8718

Sub. H. B. No. 5 Page 295
As Reported by the House Judiciary Committee
feasible, the department shall approve one or more providers 8719
from each geographical quadrant of the state. 8720
(2) Each community treatment provider that applies under 8721
division (E)(1) of this section to participate in the program 8722
shall have the provider's alcohol and drug addiction services 8723
that provide substance use disorder treatment certified by the 8724
department of mental health and addiction services under section 8725
5119.36 of the Revised Code. A community treatment provider is 8726
not required to have the provider's halfway house or residential 8727
treatment certified by the department of mental health and 8728
addiction services. 8729
(F) The department of rehabilitation and correction shall 8730
adopt rules for the operation of the substance use disorder 8731
treatment program it establishes under division (B) of this 8732
section and shall operate the program in accordance with this 8733
section and those rules. The rules shall establish, at a 8734
minimum, all of the following: 8735
(1) Criteria that establish which qualified prisoners are 8736
eligible for the program; 8737
(2) Criteria that must be satisfied to transfer a 8738
qualified prisoner to a residence pursuant to division (C)(3) of 8739
this section; 8740
(3) Criteria for the removal of a prisoner from the 8741
