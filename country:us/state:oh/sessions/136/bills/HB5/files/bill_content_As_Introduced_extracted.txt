sanction imposed for the offense solely by reason of producing 2885
positive results on a drug test, the court, as punishment for 2886
the violation of the sanction, shall not order that the offender 2887
be imprisoned unless the court determines on the record either 2888

sanction that includes addiction services and recovery supports 2906
included in a community-based continuum of care established 2907
under section 340.032 of the Revised Code. If the court imposes 2908

the fee collected into the state treasury, with half of that 5503
amount credited to the attorney general reimbursement fund 5504

records so that the records are permanently irretrievable. These 5547
records may only be disclosed or provided to law enforcement for 5548
the limited purpose of determining an individual's qualification 5549
or disqualification for employment in law enforcement. 5550
When any other entity other than the bureau of criminal 5551

political subdivisions shall knowingly release, disseminate, or 1385
make available for any purpose involving employment, bonding, 1386

agency, or other instrumentality of the state or of any of its 1388
political subdivisions any information or other data concerning 1389
any arrest, taking into custody, complaint, indictment, 1390
information, trial, hearing, adjudication, or correctional 1391
supervision, the records of which have been sealed pursuant to 1392
section 2151.356 of the Revised Code and the release, 1393
dissemination, or making available of which is not expressly 1394
permitted by this section. Whoever violates this division is 1395
guilty of divulging confidential information, a misdemeanor of 1396
the fourth degree. 1397

action because of the arrest or taking into custody or the 1405

(H) The judgment rendered by the court under this chapter 1407
shall not impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily 1408
imposed by conviction of a crime in that the child is not a 1409
criminal by reason of the adjudication, and no child shall be 1410
charged with or convicted of a crime in any court except as 1411
provided by this chapter. The disposition of a child under the 1412
judgment rendered or any evidence given in court shall not 1413
operate to disqualify a child in any future civil service 1414
examination, appointment, or application. Evidence of a judgment 1415
rendered and the disposition of a child under the judgment is 1416
not admissible to impeach the credibility of the child in any 1417
action or proceeding. Otherwise, the disposition of a child 1418
under the judgment rendered or any evidence given in court is 1419
admissible as evidence for or against the child in any action or 1420
proceeding in any court in accordance with the Rules of Evidence 1421
and also may be considered by any court as to the matter of 1422
sentence or to the granting of probation, and a court may 1423

applicable, and for a violation of division (A)(4) or (B) of 2835
section 2907.05 of the Revised Code for which a presumption in 2836

a prison term is necessary in order to comply with the purposes 2841

Revised Code. Division (D)(2) of this section does not apply to 2843
a presumption established under this division for a violation of 2844
division (A)(4) of section 2907.05 of the Revised Code. 2845
(2) Notwithstanding the presumption established under 2846
division (D)(1) of this section for the offenses listed in that 2847
division other than a violation of division (A)(4) or (B) of 2848
section 2907.05 of the Revised Code, the sentencing court may 2849

Chapter 2925., 3719., or 4729. of the Revised Code for which a 2854
presumption in favor of a prison term is specified as being 2855
applicable if it makes both of the following findings: 2856
(a) A community control sanction or a combination of 2857
community control sanctions would adequately punish the offender 2858
and protect the public from future crime, because the applicable 2859
factors under section 2929.12 of the Revised Code indicating a 2860
lesser likelihood of recidivism outweigh the applicable factors 2861
under that section indicating a greater likelihood of 2862
recidivism. 2863
(b) A community control sanction or a combination of 2864
community control sanctions would not demean the seriousness of 2865
the offense, because one or more factors under section 2929.12 2866
of the Revised Code that indicate that the offender's conduct 2867
was less serious than conduct normally constituting the offense 2868
are applicable, and they outweigh the applicable factors under 2869
that section that indicate that the offender's conduct was more 2870
serious than conduct normally constituting the offense. 2871
(E)(1) Except as provided in division (F) of this section, 2872

third, fourth, or fifth degree, the applicability of a 2875
presumption under division (D) of this section in favor of a 2876
prison term or of division (B) or (C) of this section in 2877
determining whether to impose a prison term for the offense 2878
shall be determined as specified in section 2925.02, 2925.03, 2879
2925.04, 2925.05, 2925.06, 2925.11, 2925.13, 2925.22, 2925.23, 2880
2925.36, or 2925.37 of the Revised Code, whichever is applicable 2881
regarding the violation. 2882
(2) If an offender who was convicted of or pleaded guilty 2883
to a felony violates the conditions of a community control 2884
sanction imposed for the offense solely by reason of producing 2885
positive results on a drug test, the court, as punishment for 2886
the violation of the sanction, shall not order that the offender 2887
be imprisoned unless the court determines on the record either 2888
of the following: 2889
(a) The offender had been ordered as a sanction for the 2890
felony to participate in a drug treatment program, in a drug 2891
education program, or in narcotics anonymous or a similar 2892
program, and the offender continued to use illegal drugs after a 2893
reasonable period of participation in the program. 2894
(b) The imprisonment of the offender for the violation is 2895
consistent with the purposes and principles of sentencing set 2896
forth in section 2929.11 of the Revised Code. 2897
(3) A court that sentences an offender for a drug abuse 2898
offense that is a felony of the third, fourth, or fifth degree 2899
may require that the offender be assessed by a properly 2900
credentialed professional within a specified period of time. The 2901
court shall require the professional to file a written 2902

H. B. No. 5 Page 99

assessment of the offender with the court. If the offender is 2903
eligible for a community control sanction and after considering 2904
the written assessment, the court may impose a community control 2905
sanction that includes addiction services and recovery supports 2906
included in a community-based continuum of care established 2907
under section 340.032 of the Revised Code. If the court imposes 2908
addiction services and recovery supports as a community control 2909
sanction, the court shall direct the level and type of addiction 2910
services and recovery supports after considering the assessment 2911
and recommendation of community addiction services providers. 2912
(F) Notwithstanding divisions (A) to (E) of this section, 2913
the court shall impose a prison term or terms under sections 2914

prison term of sixty days or one hundred twenty days as 3124
specified in division (G)(1)(d) or (e) of section 4511.19 of the 3125

department of rehabilitation and correction may place an 3145
offender sentenced to a mandatory prison term under this 3146
division in an intensive program prison established pursuant to 3147
section 5120.033 of the Revised Code if the department gave the 3148
sentencing judge prior notice of its intent to place the 3149
offender in an intensive program prison established under that 3150
section and if the judge did not notify the department that the 3151
judge disapproved the placement. Upon the establishment of the 3152
initial intensive program prison pursuant to section 5120.033 of 3153
the Revised Code that is privately operated and managed by a 3154
contractor pursuant to a contract entered into under section 3155

so that the privately operated and managed prison has full 3161
occupancy. 3162
(b) Unless the privately operated and managed prison has 3163
full occupancy, the department of rehabilitation and correction 3164
shall not place any offender sentenced to a mandatory prison 3165
term under this division in any intensive program prison 3166

sections 2950.04, 2950.041, 2950.05, and 2950.06 of the Revised 3178
Code and the duration of the duties. The judge shall inform the 3179
offender, at the time of sentencing, of those duties and of 3180
their duration. If required under division (A)(2) of section 3181
2950.03 of the Revised Code, the judge shall perform the duties 3182
specified in that section, or, if required under division (A)(6) 3183

in relation to an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty 3188

2923.02 of the Revised Code, the sentencing court shall consider 3190
the factors applicable to the felony category of the violation 3191
of section 2923.02 of the Revised Code instead of the factors 3192
applicable to the felony category of the offense attempted. 3193
(2) When considering sentencing factors under this section 3194
in relation to an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty 3195
to an attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the 3196
penalty is determined by the amount or number of unit doses of 3197
the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense, the 3198
sentencing court shall consider the factors applicable to the 3199

that is within the next lower range of controlled substance 3203
amounts than was involved in the attempt. 3204

(L) At the time of sentencing an offender for any sexually 3216
oriented offense, if the offender is a tier III sex 3217
offender/child-victim offender relative to that offense and the 3218
offender does not serve a prison term or jail term, the court 3219
may require that the offender be monitored by means of a global 3220
positioning device. If the court requires such monitoring, the 3221
cost of monitoring shall be borne by the offender. If the 3222
offender is indigent, the cost of compliance shall be paid by 3223
the crime victims reparations fund. 3224

specified under that division for any or all of the remaining 3517
specifications. 3518
(2)(a) If division (B)(2)(b) of this section does not 3519
apply, the court may impose on an offender, in addition to the 3520
longest prison term authorized or required for the offense or, 3521
for offenses for which division (A)(1)(a) or (2)(a) of this 3522
section applies, in addition to the longest minimum prison term 3523
authorized or required for the offense, an additional definite 3524
prison term of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, 3525
nine, or ten years if all of the following criteria are met: 3526
(i) The offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a 3527
specification of the type described in section 2941.149 of the 3528

(iv) The court finds that the prison terms imposed 3546
pursuant to division (B)(2)(a)(iii) of this section and, if 3547
applicable, division (B)(1) or (3) of this section are 3548
inadequate to punish the offender and protect the public from 3549
future crime, because the applicable factors under section 3550

indicating a lesser likelihood of recidivism. 3553
(v) The court finds that the prison terms imposed pursuant 3554
to division (B)(2)(a)(iii) of this section and, if applicable, 3555

serious physical harm to a person. 3595
(c) For purposes of division (B)(2)(b) of this section, 3596
two or more offenses committed at the same time or as part of 3597
the same act or event shall be considered one offense, and that 3598
one offense shall be the offense with the greatest penalty. 3599

this section shall not be reduced pursuant to section 2929.20, 3601

Revised Code that was attempted, the offender would have been 3635
subject to a sentence of life imprisonment or life imprisonment 3636
without parole for the violation of section 2907.02 of the 3637
Revised Code, the court shall impose upon the offender for the 3638

offender to serve the prison terms consecutively if the court 3930
finds that the consecutive service is necessary to protect the 3931
public from future crime or to punish the offender and that 3932
consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the 3933
seriousness of the offender's conduct and to the danger the 3934
offender poses to the public, and if the court also finds any of 3935
the following: 3936
(a) The offender committed one or more of the multiple 3937

great or unusual that no single prison term for any of the 3945
offenses committed as part of any of the courses of conduct 3946
adequately reflects the seriousness of the offender's conduct. 3947

the public from future crime by the offender. 3950

2929.191 of the Revised Code applies if, prior to July 11, 2006, 4039
a court imposed a sentence including a prison term of a type 4040
described in this division and failed to include in the sentence 4041

conviction or guilty plea, the employer may be held liable in a 4933
civil action that is based on or relates to the retention of the 4934
individual as an employee only if it is proved by a 4935
preponderance of the evidence that the person having hiring and 4936
firing responsibility for the employer had actual knowledge that 4937

sealed if the application was for sealing or expunged if the 5478
application was for expungement and, except as provided in 5479
division (C) of section 2953.34 of the Revised Code, all index 5480
references to the case that pertain to the conviction or bail 5481
forfeiture deleted and, in the case of bail forfeitures, shall 5482
dismiss the charges in the case. 5483
(b) The proceedings in the case that pertain to the 5484
conviction or bail forfeiture shall be considered not to have 5485
occurred and the conviction or bail forfeiture of the person who 5486
is the subject of the proceedings shall be sealed if the 5487
application was for sealing or expunged if the application was 5488
for expungement, except that upon conviction of a subsequent 5489
offense, a sealed record of prior conviction or bail forfeiture 5490
may be considered by the court in determining the sentence or 5491
other appropriate disposition, including the relief provided for 5492
in sections 2953.31, 2953.32, and 2953.34 of the Revised Code. 5493
(3) An applicant may request the sealing or expungement of 5494

H. B. No. 5 Page 186
As Introduced
the records of more than one case in a single application under 5495
this section. Upon the filing of an application under this 5496
section, the applicant, unless the applicant presents a poverty 5497
affidavit showing that the applicant is indigent, shall pay an 5498
application fee of fifty dollars and may pay a local court fee 5499
of not more than fifty dollars, regardless of the number of 5500
records the application requests to have sealed or expunged. If 5501
the applicant pays a fee, the court shall pay three-fifths of 5502
the fee collected into the state treasury, with half of that 5503
amount credited to the attorney general reimbursement fund 5504
created by section 109.11 of the Revised Code. If the applicant 5505
pays a fee, the court shall pay two-fifths of the fee collected 5506
into the county general revenue fund if the sealed or expunged 5507
conviction or bail forfeiture was pursuant to a state statute, 5508
or into the general revenue fund of the municipal corporation 5509
involved if the sealed or expunged conviction or bail forfeiture 5510
was pursuant to a municipal ordinance. 5511
(4) If the court orders the official records pertaining to 5512
the case sealed or expunged, the court shall do one of the 5513
following: 5514
(a) If the applicant was fingerprinted at the time of 5515
arrest or under section 109.60 of the Revised Code and the 5516
record of the applicant's fingerprints was provided to the court 5517
under division (C) of this section, forward a copy of the 5518
sealing or expungement order and the record of the applicant's 5519
fingerprints to the bureau of criminal identification and 5520
investigation. 5521
(b) If the applicant was not fingerprinted at the time of 5522
arrest or under section 109.60 of the Revised Code, or the 5523
record of the applicant's fingerprints was not provided to the 5524

H. B. No. 5 Page 187
As Introduced
court under division (C) of this section, but fingerprinting was 5525
required for the offense, order the applicant to appear before a 5526
sheriff to have the applicant's fingerprints taken according to 5527
the fingerprint system of identification on the forms furnished 5528
by the superintendent of the bureau of criminal identification 5529
and investigation. The sheriff shall forward the applicant's 5530
fingerprints to the court. The court shall forward the 5531
applicant's fingerprints and a copy of the sealing or 5532
expungement order to the bureau of criminal identification and 5533
investigation. 5534
Failure of the court to order fingerprints at the time of 5535
sealing or expungement does not constitute a reversible error. 5536
(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Revised 5537
Code to the contrary, when the bureau of criminal identification 5538
and investigation receives notice from a court that the record 5539
of a conviction or bail forfeiture has been expunged under this 5540
section, the bureau of criminal identification and investigation 5541
shall maintain a record of the expunged conviction record for 5542
the limited purpose of determining an individual's qualification 5543
or disqualification for employment in law enforcement. The 5544
bureau of criminal identification and investigation shall not be 5545
compelled by the court to destroy, delete, or erase those 5546
records so that the records are permanently irretrievable. These 5547
records may only be disclosed or provided to law enforcement for 5548
the limited purpose of determining an individual's qualification 5549
or disqualification for employment in law enforcement. 5550
When any other entity other than the bureau of criminal 5551
identification and investigation receives notice from a court 5552
that the record of a conviction or bail forfeiture has been 5553
expunged under this section, the entity shall destroy, delete, 5554

H. B. No. 5 Page 188

and erase the record as appropriate for the record's physical or 5555
electronic form or characteristic so that the record is 5556
permanently irretrievable. 5557
Sec. 2953.321. (A)(1) If a person is convicted of or 5558
pleads guilty to a misdemeanor or a felony of the fourth or 5559
fifth degree on or after the effective date of this section and 5560
if the record of conviction for the misdemeanor or felony of the 5561

2953.32 or 2953.61 of the Revised Code, at the expiration of 5563
five years after the offender's final discharge, the offender is 5564
eligible to have the offender's record of conviction for the 5565
misdemeanor or felony of the fourth or fifth degree sealed under 5566
this section. 5567
(2) Ninety days prior to the date that the offender is 5568
eligible to have the offender's record of conviction sealed, the 5569
sentencing court shall notify the offender, the prosecutor, the 5570
victim, and the victim's representative, if applicable, that the 5571
offender is eligible to have the offender's record of conviction 5572
sealed. 5573
(3) The prosecutor or victim may object to the sealing of 5574
the record of conviction by filing a written objection with the 5575
court not later than fourteen days prior to the date that the 5576
offender is eligible to have the offender's record of conviction 5577
sealed. The prosecutor or victim shall specify in the objection 5578
the reasons for believing a denial of the sealing of the record 5579
of conviction is justified. 5580
(B) If the prosecutor or victim does not object to the 5581
sealing of the record of conviction, the sentencing court shall 5582
determine whether the requirements in division (D) of this 5583
section have been met. If the sentencing court finds that all of 5584

H. B. No. 5 Page 189
As Introduced
the requirements in division (D) of this section have been met, 5585
the sentencing court shall seal the offender's record of 5586
conviction for the misdemeanor or felony of the fourth or fifth 5587
degree. A hearing or application requesting a sealing order is 5588
not required or needed. 5589
(C)(1) If the prosecutor or victim does object to the 5590
sealing of the record of conviction, the court shall set a date 5591
for a hearing and notify the offender and prosecutor for the 5592
case of the hearing. The prosecutor shall provide timely notice 5593
of the hearing to the victim and the victim's representative, if 5594
applicable. The court shall hold the hearing not less than 5595
forty-five days and not more than ninety days after the date 5596
that the offender is eligible to have the offender's record of 5597
conviction sealed. 5598
(2) If the offender has been served with notice of the 5599
hearing and fails to appear at the hearing, the sentencing court 5600
may deny the sealing of the offender's record of conviction for 5601
the misdemeanor or felony of the fourth or fifth degree without 5602
conducting an evidentiary hearing. 5603
(3) If the offender has been served with the notice of the 5604
hearing and appears at the hearing, the sentencing court shall 5605
determine whether the requirements in division (D) of this 5606
section have been met and shall consider the criteria in 5607
division (E) of this section. 5608
(a) If the sentencing court determines that all of the 5609
requirements in division (D) of this section have been met, and 5610
that the interests of the offender in having the records 5611
pertaining to the offender's record of conviction sealed are not 5612
substantially outweighed by any legitimate governmental needs to 5613
maintain those records, the sentencing court shall seal the 5614

H. B. No. 5 Page 190
As Introduced
offender's record of conviction for the misdemeanor or felony of 5615
the fourth or fifth degree. 5616
(b) If the sentencing court does not make the 5617
determinations described in division (C)(3)(a) of this section, 5618
the sentencing court shall deny the sealing of the offender's 5619
record of conviction for the misdemeanor or felony of the fourth 5620
or fifth degree. 5621
(D) Regardless of whether the prosecutor or victim objects 5622

requirements have been met: 5625
(1) The record of conviction for sealing is a misdemeanor 5626
or a felony of the fourth or fifth degree. 5627
(2) The record of conviction for sealing described in 5628

(3) The offender has not been convicted of a felony 5631
offense of violence that is not a sexually oriented offense. 5632

oriented offense when the offender is subject to the 5634
requirements of Chapter 2950. of the Revised Code or Chapter 5635
2950. of the Revised Code as it existed prior to January 1, 5636
2008. 5637
(5) The offender has not been convicted of any felony 5638
other than a felony of the fourth or fifth degree. 5639

H. B. No. 5 Page 191
As Introduced
(1) If the prosecutor has filed an objection in accordance 5643
with division (A) of this section, consider the reasons against 5644
sealing the record of conviction specified by the prosecutor in 5645
the objection. 5646
(2) If the victim has filed an objection in accordance 5647
with division (A) of this section, consider the reasons against 5648
sealing the record of conviction specified by the victim in the 5649
objection. 5650
(3) Determine whether the interests of the offender in 5651
having the record of conviction sealed are not substantially 5652
outweighed by the legitimate needs, if any, of the government to 5653
maintain those records. 5654
(F) If the sentencing court makes the findings required in 5655
division (B) or (C) of this section, the sentencing court shall 5656
issue the sealing order and order all official records of that 5657
case that pertain to the conviction sealed and all index 5658
references to the case that pertain to the record of conviction 5659
deleted. The proceedings in the case that pertain to the 5660
conviction shall be considered not to have occurred and the 5661
conviction of the person who is subject to the proceedings shall 5662
be sealed. 5663
(G) Regardless of whether the sentencing court issues a 5664
sealing order under division (B) or (C) of this section, the 5665
court shall notify the offender and the prosecutor for the case 5666
of the court's decision. The prosecutor shall provide timely 5667
notice to the victim and the victim's representative, if 5668
applicable. 5669
(H)(1) Except as provided in division (H)(2) of this 5670
section, nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit 5671

the fourth or fifth degree under this section, the person may 5676
not apply for a sealing or expungement order under section 5677
2953.32 of the Revised Code until one hundred eighty days or 5678
more after the court denies the sealing of the person's record 5679

(E) Notwithstanding any provision of this section or 5790
section 2953.32 or 2953.321 of the Revised Code that requires 5791
otherwise, if the auditor of state or a prosecutor maintains 5792
records, reports, or audits of an individual who has been 5793
forever disqualified from holding public office, employment, or 5794
a position of trust in this state under sections 2921.41 and 5795
2921.43 of the Revised Code, or has otherwise been convicted of 5796
an offense based upon the records, reports, or audits of the 5797
auditor of state, the auditor of state or prosecutor is 5798
permitted to maintain those records to the extent they were used 5799

conviction, and shall not be compelled by court order to seal or 5801
expunge those records. 5802
(F) For purposes of sections 2953.31 and 2953.34 of the 5803
Revised Code, DNA records collected in the DNA database and 5804
fingerprints filed for record by the superintendent of the 5805
bureau of criminal identification and investigation shall not be 5806
sealed or expunged unless the superintendent receives a 5807
certified copy of a final court order establishing that the 5808
offender's conviction has been overturned. For purposes of this 5809
section, a court order is not "final" if time remains for an 5810
appeal or application for discretionary review with respect to 5811
the order. 5812
(G)(1) The court shall send notice of any order to seal or 5813
expunge official records issued pursuant to section 2953.32 or 5814

identification and investigation and to any public office or 5816
agency that the court knows or has reason to believe may have 5817
any record of the case, whether or not it is an official record, 5818
that is the subject of the order. 5819

(2) The sealing of a record under section 2953.32 or 5820
2953.321 of the Revised Code does not affect the assessment of 5821
points under section 4510.036 of the Revised Code and does not 5822
erase points assessed against a person as a result of the sealed 5823
record. 5824

expunged pursuant to an order issued pursuant to section 2953.33 5834
of the Revised Code may present a copy of that order and a 5835
written request to comply with it, to a public office or agency 5836
that has a record of the case that is the subject of the order. 5837
(3) An order to seal or expunge official records issued 5838
pursuant to section 2953.33 of the Revised Code applies to every 5839
public office or agency that has a record of the case that is 5840
the subject of the order, regardless of whether it receives 5841
notice of the hearing on the application for the order to seal 5842
or expunge the official records or receives a copy of the order 5843
to seal the official records pursuant to division (H)(1) or (2) 5844
of this section. 5845
(4) Upon receiving a copy of an order to seal or expunge 5846

2953.33 of the Revised Code, a public office or agency shall 5850

this section, except that if the order is a sealing order, the 5852
office or agency may maintain a record of the case that is the 5853
subject of the order if the record is maintained for the purpose 5854
of compiling statistical data only and does not contain any 5855
reference to the person who is the subject of the case and the 5856
order. 5857
(5) A public office or agency to which division (H)(4) of 5858
this section applies also may maintain an index of sealed 5859
official records that are the subject of a sealing order, in a 5860
form similar to that for sealed records of conviction as set 5861
forth in division (C) of this section, access to which may not 5862
be afforded to any person other than the person who has custody 5863
of the sealed official records. The sealed official records to 5864
which such an index pertains shall not be available to any 5865
person, except that the official records of a case that have 5866
been sealed may be made available to the following persons for 5867
the following purposes: 5868
(a) To the person who is the subject of the records upon 5869
written application, and to any other person named in the 5870
application, for any purpose; 5871

not a decision on the merits, it shall conduct an adjudication 6420
to determine whether the registered nurse, licensed practical 6421
nurse, or dialysis technician committed the act on which the 6422
original conviction, plea, or judicial finding was based. If the 6423
board determines on the basis of the adjudication that the 6424

technician committed such act, or if the registered nurse, 6426
licensed practical nurse, or dialysis technician does not 6427

physical examination when directed constitutes an admission of 6468
the allegations, unless the failure is due to circumstances 6469
beyond the individual's control, and a default and final order 6470
may be entered without the taking of testimony or presentation 6471
of evidence. 6472

(H) The board shall investigate evidence that appears to 6489
show that any person has violated any provision of this chapter 6490
or any rule of the board. Any person may report to the board any 6491

absence of bad faith, any person who reports such information or 6494
who testifies before the board in any adjudication conducted 6495
under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code shall not be liable for 6496
civil damages as a result of the report or testimony. 6497

records, the investigation and proceeding shall be conducted in 6515
such a manner as to protect patient confidentiality. 6516

specify that its action is permanent. An individual subject to 6537
permanent action taken by the board is forever ineligible to 6538
hold a license or certificate of the type that was refused or 6539

(E) For purposes of this division, an individual 6648
authorized to practice as a pharmacist or pharmacy intern 6649
accepts the privilege of practicing in this state subject to 6650
supervision by the board. By filing an application for or 6651
holding a license to practice as a pharmacist or pharmacy 6652
intern, an individual gives consent to submit to a mental or 6653
physical examination when ordered to do so by the board in 6654

If the board has reasonable cause to believe that an 6658
individual who is a pharmacist or pharmacy intern is physically 6659
or mentally impaired, the board may require the individual to 6660
submit to a physical or mental examination, or both. The expense 6661

Failure of an individual who is a pharmacist or pharmacy 6664
intern to submit to a physical or mental examination ordered by 6665
the board, unless the failure is due to circumstances beyond the 6666
individual's control, constitutes an admission of the 6667
allegations and a suspension order shall be entered without the 6668
taking of testimony or presentation of evidence. Any subsequent 6669
adjudication hearing under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code 6670
concerning failure to submit to an examination is limited to 6671
consideration of whether the failure was beyond the individual's 6672
control. 6673
If, based on the results of an examination ordered under 6674

ability to practice is impaired, the board shall suspend the 6676
individual's license or deny the individual's application and 6677
shall require the individual, as a condition for an initial, 6678
continued, reinstated, or renewed license to practice, to submit 6679
to a physical or mental examination and treatment. 6680

not be subject to suspension by a court during pendency of any 6682
appeal filed under section 119.12 of the Revised Code. 6683

Revised Code to give notice of an opportunity for a hearing and 6685
the applicant or licensee does not make a timely request for a 6686

the board is not required to hold a hearing, but may adopt a 6688
final order that contains the board's findings. In the final 6689

division (A) of this section. 6691

any sanction imposed by the board under this section: records of 6700
any conviction, guilty plea, judicial finding of guilt resulting 6701
