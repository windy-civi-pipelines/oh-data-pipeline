the appropriate taxpayer notified the legislative authority of 213
the county, township, or municipal corporation from which the 214
employment positions would be relocated. For purposes of this 215
paragraph, the movement of an employment position from one 216
political subdivision to another political subdivision shall be 217
considered a relocation of an employment position unless the 218
movement is confined to the project site. The transfer of an 219
employment position from one political subdivision to another 220
political subdivision shall not be considered a relocation of an 221
employment position if the employment position in the first 222
political subdivision is replaced by another employment 223
position. 224

requirement set forth in the agreement, the tax credit authority 236
may amend the agreement to reduce the percentage of the 237
exemption or term during which the exemption applies to the 238
computer data center equipment used or to be used by the 239
noncompliant taxpayer at an eligible computer data center. The 240
reduction of the percentage or term may take effect in the 241
current calendar year. 242
(H) Financial statements and other information submitted 243
to the department of development services or the tax credit 244
authority by an applicant for or recipient of an exemption under 245
this section, and any information taken for any purpose from 246
such statements or information, are not public records subject 247
to section 149.43 of the Revised Code. However, the chairperson 248
of the authority may make use of the statements and other 249
information for purposes of issuing public reports or in 250
connection with court proceedings concerning tax exemption 251
agreements under this section. Upon the request of the tax 252
commissioner, the chairperson of the authority shall provide to 253
the tax commissioner any statement or other information 254
submitted by an applicant for or recipient of an exemption under 255
this section. The tax commissioner shall preserve the 256

S. B. No. 190 Page 10

permit under section 5739.031 of the Revised Code to each 259
taxpayer subject to an agreement under this section. Such direct 260
payment permit shall authorize the taxpayer to pay any sales and 261
use taxes due on purchases of computer data center equipment 262
used or to be used in an eligible computer data center and to 263
pay any sales and use taxes due on purchases of tangible 264
personal property or taxable services other than computer data 265
center equipment used or to be used in an eligible computer data 266
center directly to the tax commissioner. Each such taxpayer 267
shall pay pursuant to such direct payment permit all sales tax 268
levied on such purchases under sections 5739.02, 5739.021, 269

Section 35:
5739.023, and 5739.026 of the Revised Code and all use tax 270
levied on such purchases under sections 5741.02, 5741.021, 271

Section 36:
5741.022, and 5741.023 of the Revised Code, consistent with the 272
terms of the agreement entered into under this section. 273
During the term of an agreement under this section each 274
taxpayer subject to the agreement shall submit to the tax 275
commissioner a return that shows the amount of computer data 276
center equipment purchased for use at the eligible computer data 277
center, the amount of tangible personal property and taxable 278
services other than computer data center equipment purchased for 279
use at the eligible computer data center, the amount of tax 280
under Chapter 5739. or 5741. of the Revised Code that would be 281
due in the absence of the agreement under this section, the 282
exemption percentage for computer data center equipment 283
specified in the agreement, and the amount of tax due under 284
Chapter 5739. or 5741. of the Revised Code as a result of the 285
agreement under this section. Each such taxpayer shall pay the 286
tax shown on the return to be due in the manner and at the times 287
as may be further prescribed by the tax commissioner. Each such 288
taxpayer shall include a copy of the director of development 289
S. B. No. 190 Page 11
As Introduced
services' certificate of verification issued under division (E) 290
(6) of this section. Failure to submit a copy of the certificate 291
with the return does not invalidate the claim for exemption if 292
the taxpayer submits a copy of the certificate to the tax 293
commissioner within the time prescribed by section 5703.0510 of 294
the Revised Code. 295
(J) If the director of development services determines 296
that one or more taxpayers received an exemption from taxes due 297
on the purchase of computer data center equipment purchased for 298
use at a computer data center that no longer complies with the 299
requirement under division (E)(3) of this section, the director 300
shall notify the tax credit authority and, if applicable, the 301
taxpayer that applied to enter the agreement for the exemption 302
under division (C) of this section of the noncompliance. After 303
receiving such a notice, and after giving each taxpayer subject 304
to the agreement an opportunity to explain the noncompliance, 305
the authority may terminate the agreement and require each such 306
taxpayer to pay to the state all or a portion of the taxes that 307
would have been owed in regards to the exempt equipment in 308
previous years, all as determined under rules adopted pursuant 309
to division (K) of this section. In determining the portion of 310
the taxes that would have been owed on the previously exempted 311
equipment to be paid to this state by a taxpayer, the authority 312
shall consider the effect of market conditions on the eligible 313
computer data center, whether the taxpayer continues to maintain 314
other operations in this state, and, with respect to agreements 315
involving multiple taxpayers, the taxpayer's level of 316
responsibility for the noncompliance. After making the 317
determination, the authority shall certify to the tax 318
commissioner the amount to be paid by each taxpayer subject to 319
the agreement. The tax commissioner shall make an assessment for 320
S. B. No. 190 Page 12
As Introduced
that amount against each such taxpayer under Chapter 5739. or 321

Section 37:
5741. of the Revised Code. The time limitations on assessments 322
under those chapters do not apply to an assessment under this 323
division, but the tax commissioner shall make the assessment 324
within one year after the date the authority certifies to the 325
tax commissioner the amount to be paid by the taxpayer. 326
(K) The director of development services, after 327
consultation with the tax commissioner and in accordance with 328
Chapter 119. of the Revised Code, shall adopt rules necessary to 329
implement this section. The rules may provide for recipients of 330
tax exemptions under this section to be charged fees to cover 331
administrative costs incurred in the administration of this 332

Section 38:
section. The fees collected shall be credited to the tax 333
incentives operating fund created in section 122.174 of the 334
Revised Code. At the time the director gives public notice under 335
division (A) of section 119.03 of the Revised Code of the 336
adoption of the rules, the director shall submit copies of the 337
proposed rules to the chairpersons of the standing committees on 338
economic development in the senate and the house of 339
representatives. 340
(L) On or before the first day of August of each year, the 341
director of development services shall submit a report to the 342
governor, the president of the senate, and the speaker of the 343
house of representatives on the tax exemption authorized under 344
this section. The report shall include information on the number 345
of agreements that were entered into under this section during 346
the preceding calendar year, a description of the eligible 347
computer data center that is the subject of each such agreement, 348
and an update on the status of eligible computer data centers 349
under agreements entered into before the preceding calendar 350
year. 351

(M) A taxpayer may be made a party to an existing 352
agreement entered into under this section by the tax credit 353
authority and another taxpayer or group of taxpayers. In such a 354
case, the taxpayer shall be entitled to all benefits and bound 355
by all obligations contained in the agreement and all 356
requirements described in this section. When an agreement 357
includes multiple taxpayers, each taxpayer shall be entitled to 358
a direct payment permit as authorized in division (I) of this 359

the director shall not transfer money from the sales tax holiday 448
fund to the general revenue fund, local government fund, public 449

taxes of any previous year that have been omitted or that are 487
delinquent, including the penalties and interest thereon, and 488
upon the amount of public utility property listed on the general 489
tax list and duplicate in the county, in the name of each public 490
utility, which shall be assessed equally on all property subject 491
to such taxes, and entered in one or more columns, in such 492
manner and form as the tax commissioner prescribes. The auditor 493
shall enter as separate items any interest required to be so 494
entered under division (B)(1), (2), or (3) of section 323.121 of 495

authority or unit has been initiated under section 5705.341 or 501

Section 46:
5705.37 of the Revised Code but a final determination has not 502
been made, the county auditor, in order to avoid a delay in the 503
preparation of the tax list and duplicate, may proceed under 504
division (A) of this section, using in lieu of the rate of tax 505
to be levied for such authority or unit for any levy that has 506
not been so certified, the estimated rate certified to the 507
taxing authority or unit under section 5705.34 of the Revised 508
Code. If as a result of the appeal the tax rate certified to the 509
county auditor is not the same as the estimated rate used to 510
determine the sums to be levied, the auditor shall proceed in 511
the manner prescribed by this section and sections section 512

Section 47:
319.301 and 319.302 of the Revised Code to determine the correct 513
amount of taxes to be levied, charged, and payable for the year. 514
If the correct amount of taxes charged and payable after the 515
determination is complete is greater than or less than the taxes 516
charged and payable as shown on the tax list and duplicate, a 517
clerical error shall be deemed to have occurred in the 518
preparation of the tax list and duplicate, and the auditor shall 519
proceed in the manner prescribed by section 319.35 of the 520
Revised Code. 521
(C) Notwithstanding section 2723.01 of the Revised Code, 522
when any taxing district or the county auditor or county 523
treasurer is involved in litigation, no court shall, with 524
respect to such litigation, enjoin the collection of any taxes 525
on real property, except assessments, for the current tax year, 526
on or after the fifteenth day of November of that year. Any such 527
injunction issued prior to that date shall expire on the 528
fifteenth day of November of that year, and the county auditor 529
and county treasurer shall proceed to levy and collect taxes for 530

(1) Each tax that is a subject of the litigation and that 532
was approved and authorized by the county budget commission 533
pursuant to section 5705.31 of the Revised Code shall be levied 534
by the county auditor at the rate approved and authorized by the 535
budget commission. 536
(2) With respect to any other matter that was the subject 537
of any order, determination, or certification required by law to 538
be made by the tax commissioner, or is the subject of any rule, 539
opinion, order, or instruction issued by the commissioner 540
pursuant to section 5715.28, 5715.29, or 5715.30 of the Revised 541
Code, the county auditor shall proceed in accordance with such 542
authority. 543
The court shall attempt to decide the litigation prior to 544
the first day of May, so that, absent an appeal, the county 545
auditor may adjust the amount of taxes to be collected at the 546
second-half collection in accordance with the order of the 547
court. In such a case the adjustment shall be treated as the 548
correction of a clerical error pursuant to section 319.35 of the 549
Revised Code. 550
Sec. 319.301. (A) The reductions required by division (D) 551
of this section do not apply to any of the following: 552
(1) Taxes levied at whatever rate is required to produce a 553
specified amount of tax money, including a tax levied under 554

Section 48:
section 5705.199 or 5748.09 of the Revised Code, or an amount to 555
pay debt charges; 556
(2) Taxes levied within the one per cent limitation 557
imposed by Section 2 of Article XII, Ohio Constitution; 558
(3) Taxes provided for by the charter of a municipal 559

corporation. 560
(B) As used in this section: 561
(1) "Real property" includes real property owned by a 562
railroad. 563
(2) "Carryover property" means all real property on the 564
current year's tax list except: 565
(a) Land and improvements that were not taxed by the 566
district in both the preceding year and the current year; 567
(b) Land and improvements that were not in the same class 568
in both the preceding year and the current year. 569
(3) "Effective tax rate" means with respect to each class 570
of property: 571
(a) The sum of the total taxes that would have been 572
charged and payable for current expenses against real property 573
in that class if each of the district's taxes were reduced for 574
the current year under division (D)(1) of this section without 575
regard to the application of division (E)(3) of this section 576
divided by 577
(b) The taxable value of all real property in that class. 578
(4) "Taxes charged and payable" means the taxes charged 579
and payable prior to any reduction required by section 319.302 580

Section 49:
323.152 of the Revised Code. 581
(C) The tax commissioner shall make the determinations 582
required by this section each year, without regard to whether a 583
taxing district has territory in a county to which section 584

Section 50:
5715.24 of the Revised Code applies for that year. Separate 585
determinations shall be made for each of the two classes 586

established pursuant to section 5713.041 of the Revised Code. 587
(D) With respect to each tax authorized to be levied by 588
each taxing district, the tax commissioner, annually, shall do 589
both of the following: 590
(1) Determine by what percentage, if any, the sums levied 591
by such tax against the carryover property in each class would 592
have to be reduced for the tax to levy the same number of 593
dollars against such property in that class in the current year 594
as were charged against such property by such tax in the 595
preceding year subsequent to the reduction made under this 596

Section 51:
section but before the any reduction made under section 319.302 597

Section 52:
323.152 of the Revised Code. In the case of a tax levied for the 598
first time that is not a renewal of an existing tax, the 599
commissioner shall determine by what percentage the sums that 600
would otherwise be levied by such tax against carryover property 601
in each class would have to be reduced to equal the amount that 602
would have been levied if the full rate thereof had been imposed 603
against the total taxable value of such property in the 604
preceding tax year. A tax or portion of a tax that is designated 605
a replacement levy under section 5705.192 of the Revised Code is 606
not a renewal of an existing tax for purposes of this division. 607
(2) Certify each percentage determined in division (D)(1) 608
of this section, as adjusted under division (E) of this section, 609
and the class of property to which that percentage applies to 610
the auditor of each county in which the district has territory. 611
The auditor, after complying with section 319.30 of the Revised 612
Code, shall reduce the sum to be levied by such tax against each 613
parcel of real property in the district by the percentage so 614
certified for its class. Certification shall be made by the 615
first day of September except in the case of a tax levied for 616
S. B. No. 190 Page 22
As Introduced
the first time, in which case certification shall be made within 617
fifteen days of the date the county auditor submits the 618
information necessary to make the required determination. 619
(E)(1) As used in division (E)(2) of this section, "pre- 620
1982 joint vocational taxes" means, with respect to a class of 621
property, the difference between the following amounts: 622
(a) The taxes charged and payable in tax year 1981 against 623
the property in that class for the current expenses of the joint 624
vocational school district of which the school district is a 625
part after making all reductions under this section; 626
(b) Two-tenths of one per cent of the taxable value of all 627
real property in that class. 628
If the amount in division (E)(1)(b) of this section 629
exceeds the amount in division (E)(1)(a) of this section, the 630
pre-1982 joint vocational taxes shall be zero. 631
As used in divisions (E)(2) and (3) of this section, 632
"taxes charged and payable" has the same meaning as in division 633
(B)(4) of this section and excludes any tax charged and payable 634
in 1985 or thereafter under sections 5705.194 to 5705.197 or 635

Section 53:
section 5705.199, 5705.213, 5705.219, or 5748.09 of the Revised 636
Code. 637
(2) If in the case of a school district other than a joint 638
vocational or cooperative education school district any 639
percentage required to be used in division (D)(2) of this 640

Section 54:
section for either class of property could cause the total taxes 641
charged and payable for current expenses to be less than two per 642
cent of the taxable value of all real property in that class 643
that is subject to taxation by the district, the commissioner 644
shall determine what percentages would cause the district's 645
S. B. No. 190 Page 23
As Introduced
total taxes charged and payable for current expenses against 646
that class, after all reductions that would otherwise be made 647
under this section, to equal, when combined with the pre-1982 648
joint vocational taxes against that class, the lesser of the 649
following: 650
(a) The sum of the rates at which those taxes are 651
authorized to be levied; 652
(b) Two per cent of the taxable value of the property in 653
that class. The auditor shall use such percentages in making the 654
reduction required by this section for that class. 655
(3) If in the case of a joint vocational school district 656
any percentage required to be used in division (D)(2) of this 657

Section 55:
section for either class of property could cause the total taxes 658
charged and payable for current expenses for that class to be 659
less than two-tenths of one per cent of the taxable value of 660
that class, the commissioner shall determine what percentages 661
would cause the district's total taxes charged and payable for 662
current expenses for that class, after all reductions that would 663
otherwise be made under this section, to equal that amount. The 664
auditor shall use such percentages in making the reductions 665
required by this section for that class. 666
(F) No reduction shall be made under this section in the 667
rate at which any tax is levied. 668
(G) The commissioner may order a county auditor to furnish 669
any information the commissioner needs to make the 670
determinations required under division (D) or (E) of this 671

Section 56:
section, and the auditor shall supply the information in the 672
form and by the date specified in the order. If the auditor 673
fails to comply with an order issued under this division, except 674
S. B. No. 190 Page 24
As Introduced
for good cause as determined by the commissioner, the 675
commissioner shall withhold from such county or taxing district 676
therein fifty per cent of state revenues to local governments 677
pursuant to section 5747.50 of the Revised Code or shall direct 678
the department of education and workforce to withhold therefrom 679
fifty per cent of state revenues to school districts pursuant to 680
Chapter 3317. of the Revised Code. The commissioner shall 681
withhold the distribution of such revenues until the county 682
auditor has complied with this division, and the department 683
shall withhold the distribution of such revenues until the 684
commissioner has notified the department that the county auditor 685
has complied with this division. 686
(H) If the commissioner is unable to certify a tax 687
reduction factor for either class of property in a taxing 688
district located in more than one county by the last day of 689
November because information required under division (G) of this 690

Section 57:
section is unavailable, the commissioner may compute and certify 691
an estimated tax reduction factor for that district for that 692
class. The estimated factor shall be based upon an estimate of 693
the unavailable information. Upon receipt of the actual 694
information for a taxing district that received an estimated tax 695
reduction factor, the commissioner shall compute the actual tax 696
reduction factor and use that factor to compute the taxes that 697
should have been charged and payable against each parcel of 698
property for the year for which the estimated reduction factor 699
was used. The amount by which the estimated factor resulted in 700
an overpayment or underpayment in taxes on any parcel shall be 701
added to or subtracted from the amount due on that parcel in the 702
ensuing tax year. 703
A percentage or a tax reduction factor determined or 704
computed by the commissioner under this section shall be used 705
S. B. No. 190 Page 25
As Introduced
solely for the purpose of reducing the sums to be levied by the 706
tax to which it applies for the year for which it was determined 707
or computed. It shall not be used in making any tax computations 708
for any ensuing tax year. 709
(I) In making the determinations under division (D)(1) of 710
this section, the tax commissioner shall take account of changes 711
in the taxable value of carryover property resulting from 712
complaints filed under section 5715.19 of the Revised Code for 713
determinations made for the tax year in which such changes are 714
reported to the commissioner. Such changes shall be reported to 715
the commissioner on the first abstract of real property filed 716
with the commissioner under section 5715.23 of the Revised Code 717
following the date on which the complaint is finally determined 718
by the board of revision or by a court or other authority with 719
jurisdiction on appeal. The tax commissioner shall account for 720
such changes in making the determinations only for the tax year 721
in which the change in valuation is reported. Such a valuation 722
change shall not be used to recompute the percentages determined 723
under division (D)(1) of this section for any prior tax year. 724
(J) Except as otherwise provided in sections 323.152, 725

Section 58:

classified property taxes, the county auditor, on settlement 739
with the treasurer and tax commissioner, on or before the date 740
prescribed by law for such settlement or any lawful extension of 741
such date, shall be allowed as compensation for the county 742
auditor's services the following percentages: 743

prescribed by law for such settlement or any lawful extension of 753
such date, the aggregate compensation allowed to the auditor 754
shall be reduced one per cent for each day such settlement is 755
delayed after the prescribed date. No penalty shall apply if the 756
auditor and treasurer grant all requests for advances up to 757
ninety per cent of the settlement pursuant to section 321.34 of 758

special assessments or respread of assessments levied against 1383
the homestead, and if there is a transfer of ownership 1384
subsequent to the filing of an application for a reduction in 1385
taxes, such reductions are not forfeited for such year by virtue 1386
of such transfer. 1387
(D) The reductions in taxable value referred to in this 1388

Section 77:
section shall be applied solely as a factor for the purpose of 1389
computing the reduction of taxes under this section and shall 1390
not affect the total value of property in any subdivision or 1391
taxing district as listed and assessed for taxation on the tax 1392
lists and duplicates, or any direct or indirect limitations on 1393
indebtedness of a subdivision or taxing district. If after 1394
application of sections 5705.31 and 5705.32 of the Revised Code, 1395
including the allocation of all levies within the ten-mill 1396
limitation to debt charges to the extent therein provided, there 1397
would be insufficient funds for payment of debt charges not 1398
provided for by levies in excess of the ten-mill limitation, the 1399
reduction of taxes provided for in sections 323.151 to 323.159 1400
of the Revised Code shall be proportionately adjusted to the 1401
extent necessary to provide such funds from levies within the 1402

(2) The majority of the electors of the county, voting at 1421

commissioners of a qualifying county may adopt a resolution 1426

property tax exemption to each homestead in the county that also 1428
receives the tax reduction under division (B) of section 323.152 1429
of the Revised Code. The partial exemption shall take the form 1430
of the reduction by a specified percentage each year of the real 1431
property taxes on the homestead. The resolution shall specify 1432
the percentage, which may be any amount. The board may include 1433
in the resolution a condition that the partial exemption will 1434

apply only upon the receipt by the county of additional revenue 1435
from a source specified in the resolution. The resolution shall 1436
specify the tax year in which the partial exemption first 1437
applies, which may be the tax year in which the resolution takes 1438
effect as long as the resolution takes effect before the county 1439
auditor certifies the tax duplicate of real and public utility 1440

adopting the resolution, the board shall certify copies of it to 1442

Section 81:
section. The auditor shall certify the amount of taxes remaining 1448
after the reduction to the county treasurer for collection as 1449
the real property taxes charged and payable on the homestead. 1450
(D) For each tax year, the county auditor shall certify to 1451
the board of county commissioners the total amount by which real 1452
property taxes were reduced under this section. At the time of 1453
each semi-annual settlement of real property taxes between the 1454
county auditor and county treasurer, the board of county 1455
commissioners shall pay to the auditor one-half of that total 1456
amount. Upon receipt of the payment, the county auditor shall 1457
distribute it among the various taxing districts in the county 1458
as if it had been levied, collected, and settled as real 1459
property taxes. The board of county commissioners shall make the 1460
payment from the county general fund or from any other county 1461
revenue that may be used for that purpose. In making the 1462
payment, the board may use revenue from taxes levied by the 1463
county to provide additional general revenue under sections 1464

Section 82:
5739.021 and 5741.021 of the Revised Code or to provide 1465

or the amount of securities that may be issued for any permanent 1471
improvements authorized in conjunction with a tax levy. 1472
(F) At any time, the board of county commissioners may 1473
adopt a resolution amending or repealing the partial exemption 1474
granted under this section. Upon adopting a resolution amending 1475
or repealing the partial exemption, the board shall certify 1476
copies of it to the county auditor and the tax commissioner. The 1477
resolution shall specify the tax year in which the amendment or 1478
repeal first applies, which may be the tax year in which the 1479
resolution takes effect as long as the resolution takes effect 1480
before the county auditor certifies the tax duplicate of real 1481
and public utility property for that tax year to the county 1482
treasurer. 1483
(G) If a person files a late application for a tax 1484
reduction under division (B) of section 323.152 of the Revised 1485
Code for the preceding year, and is granted the reduction, the 1486
person also shall receive the reduction under this section for 1487

the estimated cost of reclamation as determined by the chief 2293
under division (B) of this section for the increments of land on 2294
which the operator will conduct a coal mining and reclamation 2295
operation under the initial term of the permit as indicated in 2296
the application; 2297
(2) If the applicant elects to provide performance 2298
security together with reliance on the reclamation forfeiture 2299
fund through payment of the additional tax on the severance of 2300
coal that is levied under division (A)(8) (A)(10) of section 2301

Section 111:
5749.02 of the Revised Code, an amount of twenty-five hundred 2302
dollars per acre of land on which the operator will conduct coal 2303
mining and reclamation under the initial term of the permit as 2304
indicated in the application. In order for an applicant to be 2305
eligible to provide performance security in accordance with 2306
division (C)(2) of this section, the applicant, an owner and 2307
controller of the applicant, or an affiliate of the applicant 2308
shall have held a permit issued under this chapter for any coal 2309
mining and reclamation operation for a period of not less than 2310
five years. 2311
If a permit is transferred, assigned, or sold, the 2312
transferee is not eligible to provide performance security under 2313
division (C)(2) of this section if the transferee has not held a 2314
permit issued under this chapter for any coal mining and 2315
reclamation operation for a period of not less than five years. 2316
This restriction applies even if the status or name of the 2317

assignment, or sale. 2319
In the event of forfeiture of performance security that 2320

under division (B) of this section shall be obtained from money 2324
in the reclamation forfeiture fund as needed to complete the 2325
reclamation. 2326
The performance security provided under division (C) of 2327
this section for the entire area to be mined under one permit 2328
issued under this chapter shall not be less than ten thousand 2329
dollars. 2330
The performance security shall cover areas of land 2331
affected by mining within or immediately adjacent to the 2332
permitted area, so long as the total number of acres does not 2333
exceed the number of acres for which the performance security is 2334
provided. However, the authority for the performance security to 2335
cover areas of land immediately adjacent to the permitted area 2336
does not authorize a permittee to mine areas outside an approved 2337
permit area. As succeeding increments of coal mining and 2338
reclamation operations are to be initiated and conducted within 2339
the permit area, the permittee shall file with the chief 2340
additional performance security to cover the increments in 2341
accordance with this section. If a permittee intends to mine 2342
areas outside the approved permit area, the permittee shall 2343
provide additional performance security in accordance with this 2344

coal preparation plant or coal refuse disposal area or a 2354
permittee of a permitted coal preparation plant or coal refuse 2355
disposal area that is not located within a permitted area of a 2356
mine has held a permit issued under this chapter for any coal 2357
mining and reclamation operation for a period of five years or 2358
more, the applicant or permittee may provide performance 2359
security for the coal preparation plant or coal refuse disposal 2360
area either in accordance with division (C)(1) of this section 2361
in the full amount of the estimated cost of reclamation as 2362
determined by the chief or in accordance with division (C)(2) of 2363
this section in an amount of twenty-five hundred dollars per 2364
acre of land with reliance on the reclamation forfeiture fund. 2365
If a permittee has previously provided performance security 2366
under division (C)(1) of this section for a coal preparation 2367
plant or coal refuse disposal area that is not located within a 2368
permitted area of a mine and elects to provide performance 2369
security in accordance with division (C)(2) of this section, the 2370
permittee shall submit written notice to the chief indicating 2371
that the permittee elects to provide performance security in 2372
accordance with division (C)(2) of this section. Upon receipt of 2373
such a written notice, the chief shall release to the permittee 2374
the amount of the performance security previously provided under 2375
division (C)(1) of this section that exceeds the amount of 2376
performance security that is required to be provided under 2377
division (C)(2) of this section. 2378

shall be limited to the obligations established under the 2380
permit, which include completion of the reclamation plan in 2381
S. B. No. 190 Page 82

order to make the land capable of supporting the postmining land 2382
use that was approved in the permit. The period of liability 2383
under the performance security shall be for the duration of the 2384
coal mining and reclamation operation and for a period 2385
coincident with the operator's responsibility for revegetation 2386
requirements under section 1513.16 of the Revised Code. 2387
(E) The amount of the estimated cost of reclamation 2388
determined under division (B) of this section and the amount of 2389
a permittee's performance security provided in accordance with 2390
division (C)(1) of this section shall be adjusted by the chief 2391
as the land that is affected by mining increases or decreases or 2392
if the cost of reclamation increases or decreases. If the 2393
performance security was provided in accordance with division 2394
(C)(2) of this section and the chief has issued a cessation 2395
order under division (D)(2) of section 1513.02 of the Revised 2396
Code for failure to abate a violation of the contemporaneous 2397
reclamation requirement under division (A)(15) of section 2398

Section 114:
1513.16 of the Revised Code, the chief may require the permittee 2399
to increase the amount of performance security from twenty-five 2400
hundred dollars per acre of land to five thousand dollars per 2401
acre of land. 2402
The chief shall notify the permittee, each surety, and any 2403
person who has a property interest in the performance security 2404
and who has requested to be notified of any proposed adjustment 2405
to the performance security. The permittee may request an 2406
informal conference with the chief concerning the proposed 2407
adjustment, and the chief shall provide such an informal 2408
conference. 2409
If the chief increases the amount of performance security 2410
under this division, the permittee shall provide additional 2411
S. B. No. 190 Page 83

the chief decreases the amount of performance security under 2413
this division, the chief shall determine the amount of the 2414
reduction of the performance security and send either written 2415
notice or electronic notice with acknowledgment of receipt of 2416
the amount of reduction to the permittee. The permittee may 2417
reduce the amount of the performance security in the amount 2418
determined by the chief. 2419
(F) A permittee may request a reduction in the amount of 2420
the performance security by submitting to the chief 2421
documentation proving that the amount of the performance 2422
security provided by the permittee exceeds the estimated cost of 2423
reclamation if the reclamation would have to be performed by the 2424
division in the event of forfeiture of the performance security. 2425
The chief shall examine the documentation and determine whether 2426
the permittee's performance security exceeds the estimated cost 2427
of reclamation. If the chief determines that the performance 2428
security exceeds that estimated cost, the chief shall determine 2429
the amount of the reduction of the performance security and send 2430
either written notice or electronic notice with acknowledgment 2431
of receipt of the amount to the permittee. The permittee may 2432
reduce the amount of the performance security in the amount 2433
determined by the chief. Adjustments in the amount of 2434
performance security under this division shall not be considered 2435
release of performance security and are not subject to section 2436

Section 115:
1513.16 of the Revised Code. 2437
(G) If the performance security is a bond, it shall be 2438
executed by the operator and a corporate surety licensed to do 2439
business in this state. If the performance security is a cash 2440

pertaining to the performance security and approve or disapprove 2447
the documents. The chief shall notify the applicant of the 2448
chief's determination. 2449
(H) If the performance security is a bond, the chief may 2450
accept the bond of the applicant itself without separate surety 2451
when the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the chief 2452
the existence of a suitable agent to receive service of process 2453
and a history of financial solvency and continuous operation 2454
sufficient for authorization to self-insure or bond the amount. 2455
(I) Performance security provided under this section may 2456
be held in trust, provided that the state is the primary 2457
beneficiary of the trust and the custodian of the performance 2458
security held in trust is a bank, trust company, or other 2459
financial institution that is licensed and operating in this 2460
state. The chief shall review the trust document and approve or 2461

of this section, the permittee shall provide the replacement 2472
S. B. No. 190 Page 85
As Introduced
performance security within ninety days after receipt of notice 2473
from the chief. If the permittee provided performance security 2474
in accordance with division (C)(2) of this section, the 2475
permittee shall provide the replacement performance security 2476
within one year after receipt of notice from the chief, and, for 2477
a period of one year after the permittee's receipt of notice 2478
from the chief or until the permittee provides the replacement 2479
performance security, whichever occurs first, money in the 2480
reclamation forfeiture fund shall be the permittee's replacement 2481
performance security in an amount not to exceed the estimated 2482
cost of reclamation as determined by the chief. 2483
(K) If a permittee provided performance security in 2484
accordance with division (C)(1) of this section, the permittee's 2485
responsibility for repairing material damage and replacement of 2486
water supply resulting from subsidence shall be satisfied by 2487
either of the following: 2488
(1) The purchase prior to mining of a noncancelable 2489
premium-prepaid liability insurance policy in lieu of the 2490
permittee's performance security for subsidence damage. The 2491
insurance policy shall contain terms and conditions that 2492
specifically provide coverage for repairing material damage and 2493
replacement of water supply resulting from subsidence. 2494
(2) The provision of additional performance security in 2495
the amount of the estimated cost to the division of mineral 2496
resources management to repair material damage and replace water 2497
supplies resulting from subsidence until the repair or 2498
replacement is completed. However, if such repair or replacement 2499
is completed, or compensation for structures that have been 2500
damaged by subsidence is provided, by the permittee within 2501
ninety days of the occurrence of the subsidence, additional 2502
S. B. No. 190 Page 86

performance security is not required. In addition, the chief may 2503
extend the ninety-day period for a period not to exceed one year 2504
if the chief determines that the permittee has demonstrated in 2505
writing that subsidence is not complete and that probable 2506
subsidence-related damage likely will occur and, as a result, 2507
the completion of repairs of subsidence-related material damage 2508
to lands or protected structures or the replacement of water 2509
supply within ninety days of the occurrence of the subsidence 2510
would be unreasonable. 2511
(L) If the performance security provided in accordance 2512
with this section exceeds the estimated cost of reclamation, the 2513
chief may authorize the amount of the performance security that 2514
exceeds the estimated cost of reclamation together with any 2515
interest or other earnings on the performance security to be 2516
paid to the permittee. 2517

reclamation permit immediately prior to April 6, 2007, shall 2519
provide, not later than a date established by the chief, 2520

commissioner, upon application by the county auditor and county 3182
treasurer, may order the time for payment of taxes to be 3183
extended if the tax commissioner determines that penalties have 3184
accrued or would otherwise accrue for reasons beyond the control 3185

paid within sixty days after the county auditor delivers the 3259
delinquent manufactured home tax list to the county treasurer, 3260

not a residence occupied by the owner, the owner must notify the 3273
county auditor's office not later than March 31 of the year for 3274
which the taxes are due. Failure to do so may result in the 3275
owner being convicted of a fourth degree misdemeanor, which is 3276
punishable by imprisonment up to 30 days, a fine up to $250, or 3277
both, and in the owner having to repay the amount by which the 3278
taxes were erroneously or illegally reduced, plus any interest 3279
that may apply. 3280
If the taxes charged against this home have not been 3281
reduced by the 2-1/2 per cent tax reduction and the home is a 3282
residence occupied by the owner, the home may qualify for the 3283
tax reduction. To obtain an application for the tax reduction or 3284
further information, the owner may contact the county auditor's 3285
office at __________ (insert the address and telephone number of 3286

"delinquent manufactured home tax list" consisting of homes the 3417
county treasurer's records indicate have taxes that were not 3418
paid within the time prescribed by divisions (D)(3) and (F) of 3419
this section, have taxes that remain unpaid from prior years, or 3420
have unpaid tax penalties or interest that have been assessed. 3421

(H)(2)(G)(2) of section 321.24 of the Revised Code, the county 3423
auditor shall deliver a copy of the delinquent manufactured home 3424
tax list to the county treasurer. The auditor shall update and 3425
publish the delinquent manufactured home tax list annually in 3426

publishing the list among taxing districts in proportion to the 3429
amount of delinquent manufactured home taxes so published that 3430
each taxing district is entitled to receive upon collection of 3431
those taxes, or the county auditor may charge the owner of a 3432
home on the list a flat fee established under section 319.54 of 3433
the Revised Code for the cost of publishing the list and, if the 3434
fee is not paid, may place the fee upon the delinquent 3435
manufactured home tax list as a lien on the listed home, to be 3436
collected as other manufactured home taxes. 3437
(3) When taxes, penalties, or interest are charged against 3438
a person on the delinquent manufactured home tax list and are 3439
not paid within sixty days after the list is delivered to the 3440
county treasurer, the county treasurer shall, in addition to any 3441

treasurer against the owner for the recovery of the unpaid taxes 3445
following the procedures for the recovery of delinquent real 3446
property taxes in sections 323.25 to 323.28 of the Revised Code. 3447
The action may be brought in municipal or county court, provided 3448
the amount charged does not exceed the monetary limitations for 3449
original jurisdiction for civil actions in those courts. 3450
It is sufficient, having made proper parties to the suit, 3451
for the county treasurer to allege in the treasurer's bill of 3452
particulars or petition that the taxes stand chargeable on the 3453
books of the county treasurer against such person, that they are 3454
due and unpaid, and that such person is indebted in the amount 3455
of taxes appearing to be due the county. The treasurer need not 3456
set forth any other matter relating thereto. If it is found on 3457
the trial of the action that the person is indebted to the 3458
state, judgment shall be rendered in favor of the county 3459
treasurer prosecuting the action. The judgment debtor is not 3460
entitled to the benefit of any law for stay of execution or 3461
exemption of property from levy or sale on execution in the 3462
enforcement of the judgment. 3463
Upon the filing of an entry of confirmation of sale or an 3464
order of forfeiture in a proceeding brought under this division, 3465
title to the manufactured or mobile home shall be in the 3466
purchaser. The clerk of courts shall issue a certificate of 3467
title to the purchaser upon presentation of proof of filing of 3468
the entry of confirmation or order and, in the case of a 3469
forfeiture, presentation of the county auditor's certificate of 3470
sale. 3471

subject of an arm's length sale between a willing seller and a 3520

a willing seller and a willing buyer shall not be considered the 3526
true value of the home if either of the following occurred after 3527

claimed to be exempt as provided in this section. 7296
(4) If no certificate is provided or obtained within 7297
ninety days after the date on which such sale is consummated, it 7298

As Introduced
the contractor or vendor a certification sufficiently detailed 7343
to enable the contractor or vendor to ascertain the resulting 7344
classification of all materials purchased or fabricated by the 7345
contractor or vendor and transferred to the contractee. This 7346
requirement applies to a contractee regardless of whether the 7347
contractee holds a direct payment permit under section 5739.031 7348
of the Revised Code or provides to the contractor or vendor an 7349

in good faith rely on the contractee's certification. 7353
Notwithstanding division (B) of section 5739.01 of the Revised 7354
Code, if the tax commissioner determines that certain property 7355
certified by the contractee as tangible personal property 7356

contractee shall be considered to be the consumer of all 7358
materials so incorporated into that real property and shall be 7359
liable for the applicable tax, and the contractor or vendor 7360
shall be excused from any liability on those materials. 7361
If a contractee fails to provide such certification upon 7362
the request of the contractor or vendor, the contractor or 7363
vendor shall comply with the provisions of this chapter and 7364
Chapter 5741. of the Revised Code without the certification. If 7365
the tax commissioner determines that such compliance has been 7366
performed in good faith and that certain property treated as 7367
tangible personal property by the contractor or vendor is, in 7368
fact, real property, the contractee shall be considered to be 7369
the consumer of all materials so incorporated into that real 7370
property and shall be liable for the applicable tax, and the 7371
construction contractor or vendor shall be excused from any 7372
liability on those materials. 7373
S. B. No. 190 Page 253

Revised Code, whenever the total rate of tax imposed under this 7379
chapter is increased after the date after a construction 7380
contract is entered into, the contractee shall reimburse the 7381
construction contractor for any additional tax paid on tangible 7382
property consumed or services received pursuant to the contract. 7383

is required to administer within the meaning of sections 5703.17 7408
to 5703.37, 5703.39, 5703.41, and 5703.45 of the Revised Code. 7409
The commissioner may adopt and promulgate, in accordance with 7410

Section 275:
sections 119.01 to 119.13 of the Revised Code, such rules as the 7411
commissioner deems necessary to administer sections 5739.01 to 7412

Section 276:
5739.31 of the Revised Code. 7413
(2) On or before the first day of May of each year, the 7414
commissioner shall make available to vendors a notice explaining 7415

pursuant to section 5739.02, 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 of 7420
the Revised Code upon sales of things produced or distributed or 7421
services provided by such vendor, and the commissioner may waive 7422
the collection of the tax from the consumer. The commissioner 7423
shall not grant such authority unless the commissioner finds 7424
that the granting of the authority would improve compliance and 7425
increase the efficiency of the administration of the tax. The 7426
person to whom such authority is granted shall post a notice, if 7427
required by the commissioner, at the location where the product 7428
is offered for sale that the tax is included in the selling 7429

Section 277:
section 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 of the Revised Code. The 7435
proportions and ratios in a prearranged agreement shall be 7436
determined either by a test check conducted by the commissioner 7437
under terms and conditions agreed to by the commissioner and the 7438
vendor or by any other method agreed upon by the vendor and the 7439
commissioner. If the parties are unable to agree to the terms 7440
and conditions of the test check or other method, the 7441
application shall be denied. 7442
If used, the test check shall determine the proportion 7443
that taxable retail sales bear to all of the vendor's retail 7444
sales and the ratio which the tax required to be collected under 7445

Section 278:
sections 5739.02, 5739.021, 5739.023, and 5739.026 of the 7446
Revised Code bears to the receipts from the vendor's taxable 7447
retail sales. 7448
The vendor's liability for remitting the tax shall be 7449
based solely upon the proportions and ratios established in the 7450
agreement until such time that the vendor or the commissioner 7451
believes that the nature of the vendor's business has so changed 7452
as to make the agreement no longer representative. The 7453
commissioner may give notice to the vendor at any time that the 7454
authorization is revoked or the vendor may notify the 7455
commissioner that the vendor no longer elects to report under 7456
the authorization. Such notice shall be delivered to the other 7457
party in the manner provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised 7458
Code. The revocation or cancellation is effective the last day 7459
of the month in which the vendor or the commissioner receives 7460
the notice. 7461

Section 419:
section applies only to the taxable year for which the election 10638
is made by the pass-through entity. Unless the tax commissioner 10639
provides otherwise, this election, once made, is binding and 10640
irrevocable for the taxable year for which the election is made. 10641
Nothing in this division shall be construed to provide for any 10642
deduction or credit that would not be allowable if a nonresident 10643
pass-through entity investor were to file an annual return. 10644
(4) If a pass-through entity makes the election provided 10645
for under division (D) of this section, the pass-through entity 10646
shall be liable for any additional taxes, interest, interest 10647
penalty, or penalties imposed by this chapter if the tax 10648
commissioner finds that the single return does not reflect the 10649

that return. Nothing in this division shall be construed to 10651

interest penalty, or penalties as a result of the pass-through 10654
entity's making the election provided for under division (D) of 10655
this section. For the purposes of division (D) of this section, 10656
"correct tax due" means the tax that would have been paid by the 10657
pass-through entity had the single return been filed in a manner 10658
reflecting the commissioner's findings. Nothing in division (D) 10659

through entity liable for tax attributable to a pass-through 10661
entity investor's income from a source other than the pass- 10662

joint and several, but, if the federal income tax liability of 10667
either spouse is determined on a separate federal income tax 10668
return, they shall file separate returns under this section. 10669
If either spouse is not required to file a federal income 10670
tax return and either or both are required to file a return 10671
pursuant to this chapter, they may elect to file separate or 10672
joint returns, and, pursuant to that election, their liabilities 10673
are separate or joint and several. If a husband and wife file 10674
separate returns pursuant to this chapter, each must claim the 10675
taxpayer's own exemption, but not both, as authorized under 10676

Section 420:
section 5747.02 of the Revised Code on the taxpayer's own 10677

together with remittance made payable to the treasurer of state 10691
in the combined amount of the state and all school district 10692
income taxes shown to be due on the form. 10693
Upon good cause shown, the commissioner may extend the 10694
period for filing any notice or return required to be filed 10695
under this section and may adopt rules relating to extensions. 10696
If the extension results in an extension of time for the payment 10697
of any state or school district income tax liability with 10698
respect to which the return is filed, the taxpayer shall pay at 10699
the time the tax liability is paid an amount of interest 10700
computed at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of 10701
the Revised Code on that liability from the time that payment is 10702
due without extension to the time of actual payment. Except as 10703
provided in section 5747.132 of the Revised Code, in addition to 10704
all other interest charges and penalties, all taxes imposed 10705
under this chapter or Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code and 10706
remaining unpaid after they become due, except combined amounts 10707
due of one dollar or less, bear interest at the rate per annum 10708
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code until paid or 10709
until the day an assessment is issued under section 5747.13 of 10710
the Revised Code, whichever occurs first. 10711

If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to 10712
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by section 5747.02 of the 10713
Revised Code or any tax imposed under Chapter 5748. of the 10714
Revised Code, the commissioner may require returns and payments 10715
to be made otherwise than as provided in this section. 10716
To the extent that any provision in this division 10717
conflicts with any provision in section 5747.026 of the Revised 10718
Code, the provision in that section prevails. 10719

5747.062, 5747.063, 5747.064, 5747.065, or 5747.071 of the 10721
Revised Code shall be allowed to the ultimate recipient of the 10722
income as credits against payment of the appropriate taxes 10723
imposed on the ultimate recipient by section 5747.02 and under 10724
Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code. As used in this division, 10725
"ultimate recipient" means the person who is required to report 10726
income from which amounts are withheld pursuant to section 10727

Section 424:

the Revised Code on the annual return required to be filed under 10729
this section. 10730
(I) If a pass-through entity elects to file a single 10731
return under division (D) of this section and if any investor is 10732
required to file the annual return and make the payment of taxes 10733
required by this chapter on account of the investor's other 10734
income that is not included in a single return filed by a pass- 10735
through entity or any other investor elects to file the annual 10736
return, the investor is entitled to a refundable credit equal to 10737
the investor's proportionate share of the tax paid by the pass- 10738
through entity on behalf of the investor. The investor shall 10739
claim the credit for the investor's taxable year in which or 10740
with which ends the taxable year of the pass-through entity. 10741
S. B. No. 190 Page 368
As Introduced
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow any credit 10742
provided in this chapter to be claimed more than once. For the 10743
purpose of computing any interest, penalty, or interest penalty, 10744
the investor shall be deemed to have paid the refundable credit 10745
provided by this division on the day that the pass-through 10746
entity paid the estimated tax or the tax giving rise to the 10747
credit. 10748
(J) The tax commissioner shall ensure that each return 10749
required to be filed under this section includes a box that the 10750
taxpayer may check to authorize a paid tax preparer who prepared 10751
the return to communicate with the department of taxation about 10752
matters pertaining to the return. The return or instructions 10753
accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box 10754
the taxpayer authorizes the department of taxation to contact 10755
the preparer concerning questions that arise during the 10756
processing of the return and authorizes the preparer only to 10757
provide the department with information that is missing from the 10758
return, to contact the department for information about the 10759
processing of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund 10760
or payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical 10761
errors, offsets, or return preparation that the taxpayer has 10762
received from the department and has shown to the preparer. 10763
(K) The tax commissioner shall permit individual taxpayers 10764
to instruct the department of taxation to cause any refund of 10765
overpaid taxes to be deposited directly into a checking account, 10766
savings account, or an individual retirement account or 10767
individual retirement annuity, or preexisting college savings 10768
plan or program account offered by the Ohio tuition trust 10769

employment positions would be relocated. For purposes of this 215
paragraph, the movement of an employment position from one 216

employment position from one political subdivision to another 220
political subdivision shall not be considered a relocation of an 221
employment position if the employment position in the first 222
political subdivision is replaced by another employment 223
position. 224

requirement set forth in the agreement, the tax credit authority 236
may amend the agreement to reduce the percentage of the 237
exemption or term during which the exemption applies to the 238
computer data center equipment used or to be used by the 239
noncompliant taxpayer at an eligible computer data center. The 240
reduction of the percentage or term may take effect in the 241
current calendar year. 242
(H) Financial statements and other information submitted 243
to the department of development services or the tax credit 244
authority by an applicant for or recipient of an exemption under 245
this section, and any information taken for any purpose from 246
such statements or information, are not public records subject 247
to section 149.43 of the Revised Code. However, the chairperson 248
of the authority may make use of the statements and other 249
information for purposes of issuing public reports or in 250
connection with court proceedings concerning tax exemption 251
agreements under this section. Upon the request of the tax 252
commissioner, the chairperson of the authority shall provide to 253
the tax commissioner any statement or other information 254
submitted by an applicant for or recipient of an exemption under 255

S. B. No. 190 Page 10
As Introduced
permit under section 5739.031 of the Revised Code to each 259
taxpayer subject to an agreement under this section. Such direct 260
payment permit shall authorize the taxpayer to pay any sales and 261
use taxes due on purchases of computer data center equipment 262
used or to be used in an eligible computer data center and to 263
pay any sales and use taxes due on purchases of tangible 264
personal property or taxable services other than computer data 265
center equipment used or to be used in an eligible computer data 266
center directly to the tax commissioner. Each such taxpayer 267
shall pay pursuant to such direct payment permit all sales tax 268
levied on such purchases under sections 5739.02, 5739.021, 269
5739.023, and 5739.026 of the Revised Code and all use tax 270
levied on such purchases under sections 5741.02, 5741.021, 271
5741.022, and 5741.023 of the Revised Code, consistent with the 272
terms of the agreement entered into under this section. 273
During the term of an agreement under this section each 274
taxpayer subject to the agreement shall submit to the tax 275
commissioner a return that shows the amount of computer data 276
center equipment purchased for use at the eligible computer data 277
center, the amount of tangible personal property and taxable 278
services other than computer data center equipment purchased for 279
use at the eligible computer data center, the amount of tax 280
under Chapter 5739. or 5741. of the Revised Code that would be 281
due in the absence of the agreement under this section, the 282
exemption percentage for computer data center equipment 283
specified in the agreement, and the amount of tax due under 284
Chapter 5739. or 5741. of the Revised Code as a result of the 285
agreement under this section. Each such taxpayer shall pay the 286
tax shown on the return to be due in the manner and at the times 287
as may be further prescribed by the tax commissioner. Each such 288
taxpayer shall include a copy of the director of development 289

S. B. No. 190 Page 11
As Introduced
services' certificate of verification issued under division (E) 290
(6) of this section. Failure to submit a copy of the certificate 291
with the return does not invalidate the claim for exemption if 292
the taxpayer submits a copy of the certificate to the tax 293
commissioner within the time prescribed by section 5703.0510 of 294
the Revised Code. 295
(J) If the director of development services determines 296
that one or more taxpayers received an exemption from taxes due 297
on the purchase of computer data center equipment purchased for 298
use at a computer data center that no longer complies with the 299
requirement under division (E)(3) of this section, the director 300
shall notify the tax credit authority and, if applicable, the 301
taxpayer that applied to enter the agreement for the exemption 302
under division (C) of this section of the noncompliance. After 303
receiving such a notice, and after giving each taxpayer subject 304
to the agreement an opportunity to explain the noncompliance, 305
the authority may terminate the agreement and require each such 306
taxpayer to pay to the state all or a portion of the taxes that 307
would have been owed in regards to the exempt equipment in 308
previous years, all as determined under rules adopted pursuant 309
to division (K) of this section. In determining the portion of 310
the taxes that would have been owed on the previously exempted 311
equipment to be paid to this state by a taxpayer, the authority 312
shall consider the effect of market conditions on the eligible 313
computer data center, whether the taxpayer continues to maintain 314
other operations in this state, and, with respect to agreements 315
involving multiple taxpayers, the taxpayer's level of 316
responsibility for the noncompliance. After making the 317
determination, the authority shall certify to the tax 318
commissioner the amount to be paid by each taxpayer subject to 319
the agreement. The tax commissioner shall make an assessment for 320

S. B. No. 190 Page 12

that amount against each such taxpayer under Chapter 5739. or 321
5741. of the Revised Code. The time limitations on assessments 322
under those chapters do not apply to an assessment under this 323
division, but the tax commissioner shall make the assessment 324
within one year after the date the authority certifies to the 325
tax commissioner the amount to be paid by the taxpayer. 326
(K) The director of development services, after 327
consultation with the tax commissioner and in accordance with 328
Chapter 119. of the Revised Code, shall adopt rules necessary to 329
implement this section. The rules may provide for recipients of 330
tax exemptions under this section to be charged fees to cover 331
administrative costs incurred in the administration of this 332
section. The fees collected shall be credited to the tax 333
incentives operating fund created in section 122.174 of the 334
Revised Code. At the time the director gives public notice under 335
division (A) of section 119.03 of the Revised Code of the 336
adoption of the rules, the director shall submit copies of the 337
proposed rules to the chairpersons of the standing committees on 338
economic development in the senate and the house of 339
representatives. 340
(L) On or before the first day of August of each year, the 341
director of development services shall submit a report to the 342
governor, the president of the senate, and the speaker of the 343
house of representatives on the tax exemption authorized under 344
this section. The report shall include information on the number 345
of agreements that were entered into under this section during 346
the preceding calendar year, a description of the eligible 347
computer data center that is the subject of each such agreement, 348
and an update on the status of eligible computer data centers 349
under agreements entered into before the preceding calendar 350
year. 351

authority and another taxpayer or group of taxpayers. In such a 354
case, the taxpayer shall be entitled to all benefits and bound 355
by all obligations contained in the agreement and all 356
requirements described in this section. When an agreement 357
includes multiple taxpayers, each taxpayer shall be entitled to 358
a direct payment permit as authorized in division (I) of this 359
section. 360

manner and form as the tax commissioner prescribes. The auditor 493
shall enter as separate items any interest required to be so 494
entered under division (B)(1), (2), or (3) of section 323.121 of 495
the Revised Code. 496

authority or unit has been initiated under section 5705.341 or 501
5705.37 of the Revised Code but a final determination has not 502
been made, the county auditor, in order to avoid a delay in the 503
preparation of the tax list and duplicate, may proceed under 504
division (A) of this section, using in lieu of the rate of tax 505
to be levied for such authority or unit for any levy that has 506
not been so certified, the estimated rate certified to the 507
taxing authority or unit under section 5705.34 of the Revised 508
Code. If as a result of the appeal the tax rate certified to the 509
county auditor is not the same as the estimated rate used to 510
determine the sums to be levied, the auditor shall proceed in 511
the manner prescribed by this section and sections section 512
319.301 and 319.302 of the Revised Code to determine the correct 513
amount of taxes to be levied, charged, and payable for the year. 514
If the correct amount of taxes charged and payable after the 515
determination is complete is greater than or less than the taxes 516
charged and payable as shown on the tax list and duplicate, a 517
clerical error shall be deemed to have occurred in the 518
preparation of the tax list and duplicate, and the auditor shall 519
proceed in the manner prescribed by section 319.35 of the 520
Revised Code. 521
(C) Notwithstanding section 2723.01 of the Revised Code, 522
when any taxing district or the county auditor or county 523
treasurer is involved in litigation, no court shall, with 524
respect to such litigation, enjoin the collection of any taxes 525
on real property, except assessments, for the current tax year, 526
on or after the fifteenth day of November of that year. Any such 527
injunction issued prior to that date shall expire on the 528
fifteenth day of November of that year, and the county auditor 529
and county treasurer shall proceed to levy and collect taxes for 530

pursuant to section 5705.31 of the Revised Code shall be levied 534
by the county auditor at the rate approved and authorized by the 535
budget commission. 536
(2) With respect to any other matter that was the subject 537
of any order, determination, or certification required by law to 538
be made by the tax commissioner, or is the subject of any rule, 539
opinion, order, or instruction issued by the commissioner 540
pursuant to section 5715.28, 5715.29, or 5715.30 of the Revised 541
Code, the county auditor shall proceed in accordance with such 542
authority. 543
The court shall attempt to decide the litigation prior to 544
the first day of May, so that, absent an appeal, the county 545
auditor may adjust the amount of taxes to be collected at the 546
second-half collection in accordance with the order of the 547
court. In such a case the adjustment shall be treated as the 548
correction of a clerical error pursuant to section 319.35 of the 549
Revised Code. 550

323.152 of the Revised Code. 581
(C) The tax commissioner shall make the determinations 582
required by this section each year, without regard to whether a 583
taxing district has territory in a county to which section 584
5715.24 of the Revised Code applies for that year. Separate 585
determinations shall be made for each of the two classes 586

As Introduced
established pursuant to section 5713.041 of the Revised Code. 587
(D) With respect to each tax authorized to be levied by 588
each taxing district, the tax commissioner, annually, shall do 589
both of the following: 590
(1) Determine by what percentage, if any, the sums levied 591
by such tax against the carryover property in each class would 592
have to be reduced for the tax to levy the same number of 593
dollars against such property in that class in the current year 594
as were charged against such property by such tax in the 595
preceding year subsequent to the reduction made under this 596
section but before the any reduction made under section 319.302 597
323.152 of the Revised Code. In the case of a tax levied for the 598
first time that is not a renewal of an existing tax, the 599
commissioner shall determine by what percentage the sums that 600
would otherwise be levied by such tax against carryover property 601
in each class would have to be reduced to equal the amount that 602
would have been levied if the full rate thereof had been imposed 603
against the total taxable value of such property in the 604
preceding tax year. A tax or portion of a tax that is designated 605
a replacement levy under section 5705.192 of the Revised Code is 606
not a renewal of an existing tax for purposes of this division. 607
(2) Certify each percentage determined in division (D)(1) 608
of this section, as adjusted under division (E) of this section, 609
and the class of property to which that percentage applies to 610
the auditor of each county in which the district has territory. 611
The auditor, after complying with section 319.30 of the Revised 612
Code, shall reduce the sum to be levied by such tax against each 613
parcel of real property in the district by the percentage so 614
certified for its class. Certification shall be made by the 615
first day of September except in the case of a tax levied for 616

S. B. No. 190 Page 22
As Introduced
the first time, in which case certification shall be made within 617
fifteen days of the date the county auditor submits the 618
information necessary to make the required determination. 619
(E)(1) As used in division (E)(2) of this section, "pre- 620
1982 joint vocational taxes" means, with respect to a class of 621
property, the difference between the following amounts: 622
(a) The taxes charged and payable in tax year 1981 against 623
the property in that class for the current expenses of the joint 624
vocational school district of which the school district is a 625
part after making all reductions under this section; 626
(b) Two-tenths of one per cent of the taxable value of all 627
real property in that class. 628
If the amount in division (E)(1)(b) of this section 629
exceeds the amount in division (E)(1)(a) of this section, the 630
pre-1982 joint vocational taxes shall be zero. 631
As used in divisions (E)(2) and (3) of this section, 632
"taxes charged and payable" has the same meaning as in division 633
(B)(4) of this section and excludes any tax charged and payable 634
in 1985 or thereafter under sections 5705.194 to 5705.197 or 635
section 5705.199, 5705.213, 5705.219, or 5748.09 of the Revised 636
Code. 637
(2) If in the case of a school district other than a joint 638
vocational or cooperative education school district any 639
percentage required to be used in division (D)(2) of this 640
section for either class of property could cause the total taxes 641
charged and payable for current expenses to be less than two per 642
cent of the taxable value of all real property in that class 643
that is subject to taxation by the district, the commissioner 644
shall determine what percentages would cause the district's 645

S. B. No. 190 Page 23
As Introduced
total taxes charged and payable for current expenses against 646
that class, after all reductions that would otherwise be made 647
under this section, to equal, when combined with the pre-1982 648
joint vocational taxes against that class, the lesser of the 649
following: 650
(a) The sum of the rates at which those taxes are 651
authorized to be levied; 652
(b) Two per cent of the taxable value of the property in 653
that class. The auditor shall use such percentages in making the 654
reduction required by this section for that class. 655
(3) If in the case of a joint vocational school district 656
any percentage required to be used in division (D)(2) of this 657
section for either class of property could cause the total taxes 658
charged and payable for current expenses for that class to be 659
less than two-tenths of one per cent of the taxable value of 660
that class, the commissioner shall determine what percentages 661
would cause the district's total taxes charged and payable for 662
current expenses for that class, after all reductions that would 663
otherwise be made under this section, to equal that amount. The 664
auditor shall use such percentages in making the reductions 665
required by this section for that class. 666
(F) No reduction shall be made under this section in the 667
rate at which any tax is levied. 668
(G) The commissioner may order a county auditor to furnish 669
any information the commissioner needs to make the 670
determinations required under division (D) or (E) of this 671
section, and the auditor shall supply the information in the 672
form and by the date specified in the order. If the auditor 673
fails to comply with an order issued under this division, except 674

S. B. No. 190 Page 24
As Introduced
for good cause as determined by the commissioner, the 675
commissioner shall withhold from such county or taxing district 676
therein fifty per cent of state revenues to local governments 677
pursuant to section 5747.50 of the Revised Code or shall direct 678
the department of education and workforce to withhold therefrom 679
fifty per cent of state revenues to school districts pursuant to 680
Chapter 3317. of the Revised Code. The commissioner shall 681
withhold the distribution of such revenues until the county 682
auditor has complied with this division, and the department 683
shall withhold the distribution of such revenues until the 684
commissioner has notified the department that the county auditor 685
has complied with this division. 686
(H) If the commissioner is unable to certify a tax 687
reduction factor for either class of property in a taxing 688
district located in more than one county by the last day of 689
November because information required under division (G) of this 690
section is unavailable, the commissioner may compute and certify 691
an estimated tax reduction factor for that district for that 692
class. The estimated factor shall be based upon an estimate of 693
the unavailable information. Upon receipt of the actual 694
information for a taxing district that received an estimated tax 695
reduction factor, the commissioner shall compute the actual tax 696
reduction factor and use that factor to compute the taxes that 697
should have been charged and payable against each parcel of 698
property for the year for which the estimated reduction factor 699
was used. The amount by which the estimated factor resulted in 700
an overpayment or underpayment in taxes on any parcel shall be 701
added to or subtracted from the amount due on that parcel in the 702
ensuing tax year. 703
A percentage or a tax reduction factor determined or 704
computed by the commissioner under this section shall be used 705

S. B. No. 190 Page 25

solely for the purpose of reducing the sums to be levied by the 706
tax to which it applies for the year for which it was determined 707
or computed. It shall not be used in making any tax computations 708
for any ensuing tax year. 709
(I) In making the determinations under division (D)(1) of 710
this section, the tax commissioner shall take account of changes 711
in the taxable value of carryover property resulting from 712
complaints filed under section 5715.19 of the Revised Code for 713
determinations made for the tax year in which such changes are 714
reported to the commissioner. Such changes shall be reported to 715
the commissioner on the first abstract of real property filed 716
with the commissioner under section 5715.23 of the Revised Code 717
following the date on which the complaint is finally determined 718
by the board of revision or by a court or other authority with 719
jurisdiction on appeal. The tax commissioner shall account for 720
such changes in making the determinations only for the tax year 721
in which the change in valuation is reported. Such a valuation 722
change shall not be used to recompute the percentages determined 723
under division (D)(1) of this section for any prior tax year. 724
(J) Except as otherwise provided in sections 323.152, 725
323.158, 323.16, 505.06, and 715.263 of the Revised Code, the 726
amount of the taxes remaining after any reduction under this 727
section shall be the real and public utility property taxes 728
charged and payable on each parcel of real property and the 729
manufactured home tax charged and payable on each manufactured 730
or mobile home, and shall be the amounts certified to the county 731
treasurer for collection. 732

classified property taxes, the county auditor, on settlement 739

such date, shall be allowed as compensation for the county 742
auditor's services the following percentages: 743

such date, the aggregate compensation allowed to the auditor 754
shall be reduced one per cent for each day such settlement is 755
delayed after the prescribed date. No penalty shall apply if the 756
auditor and treasurer grant all requests for advances up to 757
ninety per cent of the settlement pursuant to section 321.34 of 758
the Revised Code. The compensation allowed in accordance with 759
this section on settlements made before the dates prescribed by 760
law, or the reduced compensation allowed in accordance with this 761

those sections by Am. Sub. H.B. 119 of the 127th general 771

percentage specified in division (G)(2)(F)(2) of this section. 1045
The payment shall be credited upon receipt to the county's 1046
undivided income tax fund, and the county auditor shall 1047
distribute the amount thereof among the various taxing districts 1048
of the county as if it had been levied, collected, and settled 1049

The reduction is in lieu of any reduction under section 323.158 1318
of the Revised Code or division (A)(1), (2)(b), or (3) of this 1319
section. The reduction applies to only one homestead owned and 1320
occupied by a disabled veteran. 1321
(b) Real property taxes on a homestead owned and occupied, 1322
or a homestead in a housing cooperative occupied, by the 1323
surviving spouse of a disabled veteran shall be reduced for each 1324

for the reduction has been approved. The reduction shall equal 1349
the product obtained by multiplying fifty thousand dollars of 1350
the true value of the property in money, as adjusted under 1351
division (A)(1)(d) of this section, by the amounts described in 1352

Code or division (A)(1) or (2) of this section. The reduction 1355
applies to only one homestead owned and occupied by such a 1356
surviving spouse. A homestead qualifies for a reduction in taxes 1357

any homestead, and manufactured home taxes on any manufactured 1362
or mobile home on which a manufactured home tax is assessed 1363

Code, shall be reduced for each year for which an application 1365
for the reduction has been approved. The amount of the reduction 1366
shall equal two twelve and one-half per cent of the amount of 1367
taxes to be levied by qualifying levies on the homestead or the 1368
manufactured or mobile home after applying section 319.301 of 1369
the Revised Code. For the purposes of this division, "qualifying 1370
levy" has the same meaning as in section 319.302 of the Revised 1371

(1) "Qualifying levy" means a levy approved at an election 1373
held before September 29, 2013; a levy within the ten-mill 1374
limitation; a levy provided for by the charter of a municipal 1375

(2) "Qualifying levy" does not include any replacement 1379
imposed under section 5705.192 of the Revised Code of any levy 1380
described in division (B)(1) of this section. 1381
(C) The reductions granted by this section do not apply to 1382
special assessments or respread of assessments levied against 1383
the homestead, and if there is a transfer of ownership 1384
subsequent to the filing of an application for a reduction in 1385
taxes, such reductions are not forfeited for such year by virtue 1386
of such transfer. 1387
(D) The reductions in taxable value referred to in this 1388
section shall be applied solely as a factor for the purpose of 1389
computing the reduction of taxes under this section and shall 1390
not affect the total value of property in any subdivision or 1391
taxing district as listed and assessed for taxation on the tax 1392
lists and duplicates, or any direct or indirect limitations on 1393
indebtedness of a subdivision or taxing district. If after 1394
application of sections 5705.31 and 5705.32 of the Revised Code, 1395
including the allocation of all levies within the ten-mill 1396
limitation to debt charges to the extent therein provided, there 1397
would be insufficient funds for payment of debt charges not 1398
provided for by levies in excess of the ten-mill limitation, the 1399
reduction of taxes provided for in sections 323.151 to 323.159 1400
of the Revised Code shall be proportionately adjusted to the 1401
extent necessary to provide such funds from levies within the 1402
ten-mill limitation. 1403

homestead of any person convicted of violating division (D) or 1405

Any reduction in taxes under section 323.152 of the 1412
Revised Code shall be disregarded as income or resources in 1413
determining eligibility for any program or calculating any 1414
payment under Title LI of the Revised Code. 1415

(2) The majority of the electors of the county, voting at 1421
an election held in 1996, approved a referendum on a resolution 1422
of the board of county commissioners levying a sales and use tax 1423
under sections 5739.026 and 5741.023 of the Revised Code. 1424
(B) On or before December 31, 1996, the board of county 1425
commissioners of a qualifying county may adopt a resolution 1426
under this section. The resolution shall grant a partial real 1427
property tax exemption to each homestead in the county that also 1428
receives the tax reduction under division (B) of section 323.152 1429
of the Revised Code. The partial exemption shall take the form 1430
of the reduction by a specified percentage each year of the real 1431
property taxes on the homestead. The resolution shall specify 1432
the percentage, which may be any amount. The board may include 1433
in the resolution a condition that the partial exemption will 1434

S. B. No. 190 Page 50

apply only upon the receipt by the county of additional revenue 1435
from a source specified in the resolution. The resolution shall 1436
specify the tax year in which the partial exemption first 1437
applies, which may be the tax year in which the resolution takes 1438
effect as long as the resolution takes effect before the county 1439
auditor certifies the tax duplicate of real and public utility 1440
property for that tax year to the county treasurer. Upon 1441
adopting the resolution, the board shall certify copies of it to 1442
the county auditor and the tax commissioner. 1443
(C) After complying with sections 319.301, 319.302, and 1444

remaining sum to be levied against a homestead by the percentage 1446
called for in the resolution adopted under division (B) of this 1447
section. The auditor shall certify the amount of taxes remaining 1448
after the reduction to the county treasurer for collection as 1449
the real property taxes charged and payable on the homestead. 1450
(D) For each tax year, the county auditor shall certify to 1451
the board of county commissioners the total amount by which real 1452
property taxes were reduced under this section. At the time of 1453
each semi-annual settlement of real property taxes between the 1454
county auditor and county treasurer, the board of county 1455
commissioners shall pay to the auditor one-half of that total 1456
amount. Upon receipt of the payment, the county auditor shall 1457
distribute it among the various taxing districts in the county 1458
as if it had been levied, collected, and settled as real 1459
property taxes. The board of county commissioners shall make the 1460
payment from the county general fund or from any other county 1461
revenue that may be used for that purpose. In making the 1462
payment, the board may use revenue from taxes levied by the 1463
county to provide additional general revenue under sections 1464
5739.021 and 5741.021 of the Revised Code or to provide 1465

5739.026 and 5741.023 of the Revised Code. 1467
(E) The partial exemption under this section shall not 1468
directly or indirectly affect the determination of the principal 1469
amount of notes that may be issued in anticipation of a tax levy 1470
or the amount of securities that may be issued for any permanent 1471
improvements authorized in conjunction with a tax levy. 1472
(F) At any time, the board of county commissioners may 1473
adopt a resolution amending or repealing the partial exemption 1474
granted under this section. Upon adopting a resolution amending 1475
or repealing the partial exemption, the board shall certify 1476
copies of it to the county auditor and the tax commissioner. The 1477
resolution shall specify the tax year in which the amendment or 1478
repeal first applies, which may be the tax year in which the 1479
resolution takes effect as long as the resolution takes effect 1480
before the county auditor certifies the tax duplicate of real 1481
and public utility property for that tax year to the county 1482
treasurer. 1483
(G) If a person files a late application for a tax 1484
reduction under division (B) of section 323.152 of the Revised 1485
Code for the preceding year, and is granted the reduction, the 1486
person also shall receive the reduction under this section for 1487
the preceding year. The county auditor shall credit the amount 1488
of the reduction against the person's current year taxes, and 1489
shall include the amount of the reduction in the amount 1490

the levy of an excise tax on each transaction pursuant to 1742
sections 5739.08 and 5739.09 of the Revised Code does not 1743
prevent a convention facilities authority from levying an excise 1744

Sec. 1513.08. (A) After a coal mining and reclamation 2264
permit application has been approved, the applicant shall file 2265
with the chief of the division of mineral resources management, 2266
on a form prescribed and furnished by the chief, the performance 2267
security required under this section that shall be payable to 2268
the state and conditioned on the faithful performance of all the 2269
requirements of this chapter and rules adopted under it and the 2270
terms and conditions of the permit. 2271
(B) Using the information contained in the permit 2272
application; the requirements contained in the approved permit 2273
and reclamation plan; and, after considering the topography, 2274
geology, hydrology, and revegetation potential of the area of 2275
the approved permit, the probable difficulty of reclamation; the 2276
chief shall determine the estimated cost of reclamation under 2277
the initial term of the permit if the reclamation has to be 2278
performed by the division of mineral resources management in the 2279
event of forfeiture of the performance security by the 2280
applicant. The chief shall send either written notice by 2281
certified mail or electronic notice with acknowledgment of 2282
receipt of the amount of the estimated cost of reclamation to 2283
the applicant. The applicant shall send either written notice or 2284
electronic notice with acknowledgment of receipt to the chief 2285
indicating the method by which the applicant will provide the 2286
performance security pursuant to division (C) of this section. 2287
(C) The applicant shall provide the performance security 2288
in an amount using one of the following: 2289
(1) If the applicant elects to provide performance 2290

S. B. No. 190 Page 79
As Introduced
security without reliance on the reclamation forfeiture fund 2291
created in section 1513.18 of the Revised Code, the amount of 2292
the estimated cost of reclamation as determined by the chief 2293
under division (B) of this section for the increments of land on 2294
which the operator will conduct a coal mining and reclamation 2295
operation under the initial term of the permit as indicated in 2296
the application; 2297
(2) If the applicant elects to provide performance 2298
security together with reliance on the reclamation forfeiture 2299
fund through payment of the additional tax on the severance of 2300
coal that is levied under division (A)(8) (A)(10) of section 2301
5749.02 of the Revised Code, an amount of twenty-five hundred 2302
dollars per acre of land on which the operator will conduct coal 2303
mining and reclamation under the initial term of the permit as 2304
indicated in the application. In order for an applicant to be 2305
eligible to provide performance security in accordance with 2306
division (C)(2) of this section, the applicant, an owner and 2307
controller of the applicant, or an affiliate of the applicant 2308
shall have held a permit issued under this chapter for any coal 2309
mining and reclamation operation for a period of not less than 2310
five years. 2311
If a permit is transferred, assigned, or sold, the 2312
transferee is not eligible to provide performance security under 2313
division (C)(2) of this section if the transferee has not held a 2314
permit issued under this chapter for any coal mining and 2315
reclamation operation for a period of not less than five years. 2316
This restriction applies even if the status or name of the 2317
permittee otherwise remains the same after the transfer, 2318
assignment, or sale. 2319
In the event of forfeiture of performance security that 2320

S. B. No. 190 Page 80
As Introduced
was provided in accordance with division (C)(2) of this section, 2321
the difference between the amount of that performance security 2322
and the estimated cost of reclamation as determined by the chief 2323
under division (B) of this section shall be obtained from money 2324
in the reclamation forfeiture fund as needed to complete the 2325
reclamation. 2326
The performance security provided under division (C) of 2327
this section for the entire area to be mined under one permit 2328
issued under this chapter shall not be less than ten thousand 2329
dollars. 2330
The performance security shall cover areas of land 2331
affected by mining within or immediately adjacent to the 2332
permitted area, so long as the total number of acres does not 2333
exceed the number of acres for which the performance security is 2334
provided. However, the authority for the performance security to 2335
cover areas of land immediately adjacent to the permitted area 2336
does not authorize a permittee to mine areas outside an approved 2337
permit area. As succeeding increments of coal mining and 2338
reclamation operations are to be initiated and conducted within 2339
the permit area, the permittee shall file with the chief 2340
additional performance security to cover the increments in 2341
accordance with this section. If a permittee intends to mine 2342
areas outside the approved permit area, the permittee shall 2343
provide additional performance security in accordance with this 2344
section to cover the areas to be mined. 2345
If an applicant or permittee is not eligible to provide 2346
performance security in accordance with division (C)(2) of this 2347
section, the applicant or permittee shall provide performance 2348
security in accordance with division (C)(1) of this section in 2349
the full amount of the estimated cost of reclamation as 2350

S. B. No. 190 Page 81

determined by the chief for a permitted coal preparation plant 2351
or coal refuse disposal area that is not located within a 2352
permitted area of a mine. If an applicant for a permit for a 2353
coal preparation plant or coal refuse disposal area or a 2354
permittee of a permitted coal preparation plant or coal refuse 2355
disposal area that is not located within a permitted area of a 2356
mine has held a permit issued under this chapter for any coal 2357
mining and reclamation operation for a period of five years or 2358
more, the applicant or permittee may provide performance 2359
security for the coal preparation plant or coal refuse disposal 2360
area either in accordance with division (C)(1) of this section 2361
in the full amount of the estimated cost of reclamation as 2362
determined by the chief or in accordance with division (C)(2) of 2363
this section in an amount of twenty-five hundred dollars per 2364
acre of land with reliance on the reclamation forfeiture fund. 2365
If a permittee has previously provided performance security 2366
under division (C)(1) of this section for a coal preparation 2367
plant or coal refuse disposal area that is not located within a 2368
permitted area of a mine and elects to provide performance 2369
security in accordance with division (C)(2) of this section, the 2370
permittee shall submit written notice to the chief indicating 2371
that the permittee elects to provide performance security in 2372
accordance with division (C)(2) of this section. Upon receipt of 2373
such a written notice, the chief shall release to the permittee 2374
the amount of the performance security previously provided under 2375
division (C)(1) of this section that exceeds the amount of 2376
performance security that is required to be provided under 2377
division (C)(2) of this section. 2378
(D) A permittee's liability under the performance security 2379
shall be limited to the obligations established under the 2380
permit, which include completion of the reclamation plan in 2381

S. B. No. 190 Page 82
As Introduced
order to make the land capable of supporting the postmining land 2382
use that was approved in the permit. The period of liability 2383
under the performance security shall be for the duration of the 2384
coal mining and reclamation operation and for a period 2385
coincident with the operator's responsibility for revegetation 2386
requirements under section 1513.16 of the Revised Code. 2387
(E) The amount of the estimated cost of reclamation 2388
determined under division (B) of this section and the amount of 2389
a permittee's performance security provided in accordance with 2390
division (C)(1) of this section shall be adjusted by the chief 2391
as the land that is affected by mining increases or decreases or 2392
if the cost of reclamation increases or decreases. If the 2393
performance security was provided in accordance with division 2394
(C)(2) of this section and the chief has issued a cessation 2395
order under division (D)(2) of section 1513.02 of the Revised 2396
Code for failure to abate a violation of the contemporaneous 2397
reclamation requirement under division (A)(15) of section 2398
1513.16 of the Revised Code, the chief may require the permittee 2399
to increase the amount of performance security from twenty-five 2400
hundred dollars per acre of land to five thousand dollars per 2401
acre of land. 2402
The chief shall notify the permittee, each surety, and any 2403
person who has a property interest in the performance security 2404
and who has requested to be notified of any proposed adjustment 2405
to the performance security. The permittee may request an 2406
informal conference with the chief concerning the proposed 2407
adjustment, and the chief shall provide such an informal 2408
conference. 2409
If the chief increases the amount of performance security 2410
under this division, the permittee shall provide additional 2411

S. B. No. 190 Page 83
As Introduced
performance security in an amount determined by the chief. If 2412
the chief decreases the amount of performance security under 2413
this division, the chief shall determine the amount of the 2414
reduction of the performance security and send either written 2415
notice or electronic notice with acknowledgment of receipt of 2416
the amount of reduction to the permittee. The permittee may 2417
reduce the amount of the performance security in the amount 2418
determined by the chief. 2419
(F) A permittee may request a reduction in the amount of 2420
the performance security by submitting to the chief 2421
documentation proving that the amount of the performance 2422
security provided by the permittee exceeds the estimated cost of 2423
reclamation if the reclamation would have to be performed by the 2424
division in the event of forfeiture of the performance security. 2425
The chief shall examine the documentation and determine whether 2426
the permittee's performance security exceeds the estimated cost 2427
of reclamation. If the chief determines that the performance 2428
security exceeds that estimated cost, the chief shall determine 2429
the amount of the reduction of the performance security and send 2430
either written notice or electronic notice with acknowledgment 2431
of receipt of the amount to the permittee. The permittee may 2432
reduce the amount of the performance security in the amount 2433
determined by the chief. Adjustments in the amount of 2434
performance security under this division shall not be considered 2435
release of performance security and are not subject to section 2436
1513.16 of the Revised Code. 2437
(G) If the performance security is a bond, it shall be 2438
executed by the operator and a corporate surety licensed to do 2439
business in this state. If the performance security is a cash 2440
deposit or negotiable certificates of deposit of a bank or 2441
savings and loan association, the bank or savings and loan 2442

S. B. No. 190 Page 84
As Introduced
association shall be licensed and operating in this state. The 2443
cash deposit or market value of the securities shall be equal to 2444
or greater than the amount of the performance security required 2445
under this section. The chief shall review any documents 2446
pertaining to the performance security and approve or disapprove 2447
the documents. The chief shall notify the applicant of the 2448
chief's determination. 2449
(H) If the performance security is a bond, the chief may 2450
accept the bond of the applicant itself without separate surety 2451
when the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the chief 2452
the existence of a suitable agent to receive service of process 2453
and a history of financial solvency and continuous operation 2454
sufficient for authorization to self-insure or bond the amount. 2455
(I) Performance security provided under this section may 2456
be held in trust, provided that the state is the primary 2457
beneficiary of the trust and the custodian of the performance 2458
security held in trust is a bank, trust company, or other 2459
financial institution that is licensed and operating in this 2460
state. The chief shall review the trust document and approve or 2461
disapprove the document. The chief shall notify the applicant of 2462
the chief's determination. 2463
(J) If a surety, bank, savings and loan association, trust 2464
company, or other financial institution that holds the 2465
performance security required under this section becomes 2466
insolvent, the permittee shall notify the chief of the 2467
insolvency, and the chief shall order the permittee to submit a 2468
plan for replacement performance security within thirty days 2469
after receipt of notice from the chief. If the permittee 2470
provided performance security in accordance with division (C)(1) 2471
of this section, the permittee shall provide the replacement 2472

S. B. No. 190 Page 85
As Introduced
performance security within ninety days after receipt of notice 2473
from the chief. If the permittee provided performance security 2474
in accordance with division (C)(2) of this section, the 2475
permittee shall provide the replacement performance security 2476
within one year after receipt of notice from the chief, and, for 2477
a period of one year after the permittee's receipt of notice 2478
from the chief or until the permittee provides the replacement 2479
performance security, whichever occurs first, money in the 2480
reclamation forfeiture fund shall be the permittee's replacement 2481
performance security in an amount not to exceed the estimated 2482
cost of reclamation as determined by the chief. 2483
(K) If a permittee provided performance security in 2484
accordance with division (C)(1) of this section, the permittee's 2485
responsibility for repairing material damage and replacement of 2486
water supply resulting from subsidence shall be satisfied by 2487
either of the following: 2488
(1) The purchase prior to mining of a noncancelable 2489
premium-prepaid liability insurance policy in lieu of the 2490
permittee's performance security for subsidence damage. The 2491
insurance policy shall contain terms and conditions that 2492
specifically provide coverage for repairing material damage and 2493
replacement of water supply resulting from subsidence. 2494
(2) The provision of additional performance security in 2495
the amount of the estimated cost to the division of mineral 2496
resources management to repair material damage and replace water 2497
supplies resulting from subsidence until the repair or 2498
replacement is completed. However, if such repair or replacement 2499
is completed, or compensation for structures that have been 2500
damaged by subsidence is provided, by the permittee within 2501
ninety days of the occurrence of the subsidence, additional 2502

S. B. No. 190 Page 86
As Introduced
performance security is not required. In addition, the chief may 2503
extend the ninety-day period for a period not to exceed one year 2504
if the chief determines that the permittee has demonstrated in 2505
writing that subsidence is not complete and that probable 2506
subsidence-related damage likely will occur and, as a result, 2507
the completion of repairs of subsidence-related material damage 2508
to lands or protected structures or the replacement of water 2509
supply within ninety days of the occurrence of the subsidence 2510
would be unreasonable. 2511
(L) If the performance security provided in accordance 2512
with this section exceeds the estimated cost of reclamation, the 2513
chief may authorize the amount of the performance security that 2514
exceeds the estimated cost of reclamation together with any 2515
interest or other earnings on the performance security to be 2516
paid to the permittee. 2517
(M) A permittee that held a valid coal mining and 2518
reclamation permit immediately prior to April 6, 2007, shall 2519
provide, not later than a date established by the chief, 2520
performance security in accordance with division (C)(1) or (2) 2521
of this section, rather than in accordance with the law as it 2522
existed prior to that date, by filing it with the chief on a 2523
form that the chief prescribes and furnishes. Accordingly, for 2524
purposes of this section, "applicant" is deemed to include such 2525
a permittee. 2526

which the home has its situs, and deducting from the product 3156
thus obtained the reductions required or authorized under 3157

that will cause the unavoidable delay and must be received by 3175
the tax commissioner on or before the last day of the month 3176
preceding the day delivery of the duplicate is otherwise 3177

of a tax collection period becomes unavoidable, the tax 3181
commissioner, upon application by the county auditor and county 3182

extended if the tax commissioner determines that penalties have 3184
accrued or would otherwise accrue for reasons beyond the control 3185
of the taxpayers of the county. The order shall prescribe the 3186
final extended date for payment of taxes for that collection 3187
period. 3188

for which the taxes were not paid. 3205
(6)(a) Immediately upon receipt of any manufactured home 3206
tax duplicate from the county auditor, but not less than twenty 3207
days prior to the last date on which the first one-half taxes 3208
may be paid without penalty as prescribed in division (F) of 3209
this section, the county treasurer shall cause to be prepared 3210
and mailed or delivered to each person charged on that duplicate 3211
with taxes, or to an agent designated by such person, the tax 3212
bill prescribed by the tax commissioner under division (D)(7) of 3213
this section. When taxes are paid by installments, the county 3214
treasurer shall mail or deliver to each person charged on such 3215
duplicate or the agent designated by that person a second tax 3216
bill showing the amount due at the time of the second tax 3217
collection. The second half tax bill shall be mailed or 3218
delivered at least twenty days prior to the close of the second 3219
half tax collection period. A change in the mailing address, 3220
electronic mail address, or telephone number of any tax bill 3221
shall be made in writing to the county treasurer. Failure to 3222
receive a bill required by this section does not excuse failure 3223
or delay to pay any taxes shown on the bill or, except as 3224
provided in division (B)(1) of section 5715.39 of the Revised 3225
Code, avoid any penalty, interest, or charge for such delay. 3226
A policy adopted by a county treasurer under division (A) 3227
(2) of section 323.13 of the Revised Code shall also allow any 3228
person required to receive a tax bill under division (D)(6)(a) 3229
of this section to request electronic delivery of that tax bill 3230
in the same manner. A person may rescind such a request in the 3231
same manner as a request made under division (A)(2) of section 3232

manufactured home tax list under division (H) of this section, 3237
the county treasurer may prepare and mail to each person in 3238
whose name a home is listed an additional tax bill showing the 3239
total amount of delinquent taxes charged against the home as 3240
shown on the list. The tax bill shall include a notice that the 3241
interest charge prescribed by division (G) of this section has 3242
begun to accrue. 3243
(7) Each tax bill prepared and mailed or delivered under 3244
division (D)(6) of this section shall be in the form and contain 3245
the information required by the tax commissioner. The 3246
commissioner may prescribe different forms for each county and 3247
may authorize the county auditor to make up tax bills and tax 3248
receipts to be used by the county treasurer. The tax bill shall 3249
not contain or be mailed or delivered with any information or 3250
material that is not required by this section or that is not 3251
authorized by section 321.45 of the Revised Code or by the tax 3252
commissioner. In addition to the information required by the 3253
commissioner, each tax bill shall contain the following 3254

paid within sixty days after the county auditor delivers the 3259
delinquent manufactured home tax list to the county treasurer, 3260
you and your home may be subject to collection proceedings for 3261
tax delinquency." Failure to provide such notice has no effect 3262
upon the validity of any tax judgment to which a home may be 3263

subjected. 3264
(c) In the case of manufactured or mobile homes taxed 3265
under division (D)(2) of this section, the following additional 3266
information: 3267
(i) The effective tax rate. The words "effective tax rate" 3268

(ii) The following notice: "Notice: If the taxes charged 3270
against this home have been reduced by the 2-1/2 per cent tax 3271
reduction for residences occupied by the owner but the home is 3272
not a residence occupied by the owner, the owner must notify the 3273
county auditor's office not later than March 31 of the year for 3274
which the taxes are due. Failure to do so may result in the 3275
owner being convicted of a fourth degree misdemeanor, which is 3276
punishable by imprisonment up to 30 days, a fine up to $250, or 3277
both, and in the owner having to repay the amount by which the 3278
taxes were erroneously or illegally reduced, plus any interest 3279
that may apply. 3280
If the taxes charged against this home have not been 3281
reduced by the 2-1/2 per cent tax reduction and the home is a 3282
residence occupied by the owner, the home may qualify for the 3283
tax reduction. To obtain an application for the tax reduction or 3284
further information, the owner may contact the county auditor's 3285
office at __________ (insert the address and telephone number of 3286
the county auditor's office)." 3287

5709. of the Revised Code if it were classified as real 3303
property. 3304
(2) A travel trailer or park trailer, as these terms are 3305
defined in section 4501.01 of the Revised Code, is not subject 3306
to this section if it is unused or unoccupied and stored at the 3307
owner's normal place of residence or at a recognized storage 3308
facility. 3309
(3) A travel trailer or park trailer, as these terms are 3310
defined in section 4501.01 of the Revised Code, is subject to 3311
this section and shall be taxed as a manufactured or mobile home 3312

(b) of this section, if one-half of the current taxes charged 3340
under this section against a manufactured or mobile home, 3341
together with the full amount of any delinquent taxes, are not 3342
paid on or before the first day of March in that year, or on or 3343
before the last day for such payment as extended pursuant to 3344
section 4503.063 of the Revised Code, a penalty of ten per cent 3345
shall be charged against the unpaid balance of such half of the 3346

unpaid current taxes from a first-half collection period 3354
described in division (F) of this section has been entered into 3355
under section 323.31 of the Revised Code, no ten per cent 3356
penalty shall be charged against such taxes after the second- 3357
half collection period while the delinquent tax contract remains 3358
in effect. On the day a delinquent tax contract becomes void, 3359
the ten per cent penalty shall be charged against such taxes and 3360
shall equal the amount of penalty that would have been charged 3361
against unpaid current taxes outstanding on the date on which 3362
the second-half penalty would have been charged thereon under 3363
division (G)(1)(a) of this section if the contract had not been 3364

second installment could be paid without penalty. The charge 3371
shall be for interest that accrued during the period that began 3372
on the preceding first day of December and ended on the last day 3373
of the month that included the last date such second installment 3374
could be paid without penalty. The interest shall be computed at 3375
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised 3376
Code and shall be entered as a separate item on the delinquent 3377
manufactured home tax list compiled under division (H) of this 3378
section. 3379
(b) On the first day of December beginning in 2000, the 3380
interest shall be charged against and computed on all delinquent 3381

taxes. The charge shall be for interest that accrued during the 3382
period that began on the first day of the month following the 3383
last date prescribed for the payment of the second installment 3384
of taxes in the current year and ended on the immediately 3385
preceding last day of November. The interest shall be computed 3386
at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the 3387
Revised Code and shall be entered as a separate item on the 3388
delinquent manufactured home tax list. 3389

the payment of any delinquent taxes, no interest shall be 3391
charged against such delinquent taxes while the undertaking 3392
remains in effect in compliance with section 323.31 of the 3393
Revised Code. If a valid undertaking becomes void, interest 3394
shall be charged against the delinquent taxes for the periods 3395
that interest was not permitted to be charged while the 3396
undertaking was in effect. The interest shall be charged on the 3397
day the undertaking becomes void and shall equal the amount of 3398
interest that would have been charged against the unpaid 3399
delinquent taxes outstanding on the dates on which interest 3400
would have been charged thereon under divisions (G)(1) and (2) 3401
of this section had the undertaking not been in effect. 3402
(3) If the full amount of the taxes due at either of the 3403
times prescribed by division (F) of this section is paid within 3404
ten days after such time, the county treasurer shall waive the 3405
collection of and the county auditor shall remit one-half of the 3406
penalty provided for in this division for failure to make that 3407
payment by the prescribed time. 3408
(4) The treasurer shall compile and deliver to the county 3409
auditor a list of all tax payments the treasurer has received as 3410
provided in division (G)(3) of this section. The list shall 3411

S. B. No. 190 Page 118
As Introduced
include any information required by the auditor for the 3412
remission of the penalties waived by the treasurer. The taxes so 3413
collected shall be included in the settlement next succeeding 3414
the settlement then in process. 3415
(H)(1) The county auditor shall compile annually a 3416
"delinquent manufactured home tax list" consisting of homes the 3417
county treasurer's records indicate have taxes that were not 3418
paid within the time prescribed by divisions (D)(3) and (F) of 3419
this section, have taxes that remain unpaid from prior years, or 3420
have unpaid tax penalties or interest that have been assessed. 3421
(2) Within thirty days after the settlement under division 3422
(H)(2)(G)(2) of section 321.24 of the Revised Code, the county 3423
auditor shall deliver a copy of the delinquent manufactured home 3424
tax list to the county treasurer. The auditor shall update and 3425
publish the delinquent manufactured home tax list annually in 3426
the same manner as delinquent real property tax lists are 3427
published. The county auditor may apportion the cost of 3428
publishing the list among taxing districts in proportion to the 3429
amount of delinquent manufactured home taxes so published that 3430
each taxing district is entitled to receive upon collection of 3431
those taxes, or the county auditor may charge the owner of a 3432
home on the list a flat fee established under section 319.54 of 3433
the Revised Code for the cost of publishing the list and, if the 3434
fee is not paid, may place the fee upon the delinquent 3435
manufactured home tax list as a lien on the listed home, to be 3436
collected as other manufactured home taxes. 3437
(3) When taxes, penalties, or interest are charged against 3438
a person on the delinquent manufactured home tax list and are 3439
not paid within sixty days after the list is delivered to the 3440
county treasurer, the county treasurer shall, in addition to any 3441

S. B. No. 190 Page 119
As Introduced
other remedy provided by law for the collection of taxes, 3442
penalties, and interest, enforce collection of such taxes, 3443
penalties, and interest by civil action in the name of the 3444
treasurer against the owner for the recovery of the unpaid taxes 3445
following the procedures for the recovery of delinquent real 3446
property taxes in sections 323.25 to 323.28 of the Revised Code. 3447
The action may be brought in municipal or county court, provided 3448
the amount charged does not exceed the monetary limitations for 3449
original jurisdiction for civil actions in those courts. 3450
It is sufficient, having made proper parties to the suit, 3451
for the county treasurer to allege in the treasurer's bill of 3452
particulars or petition that the taxes stand chargeable on the 3453
books of the county treasurer against such person, that they are 3454
due and unpaid, and that such person is indebted in the amount 3455
of taxes appearing to be due the county. The treasurer need not 3456
set forth any other matter relating thereto. If it is found on 3457
the trial of the action that the person is indebted to the 3458
state, judgment shall be rendered in favor of the county 3459
treasurer prosecuting the action. The judgment debtor is not 3460
entitled to the benefit of any law for stay of execution or 3461
exemption of property from levy or sale on execution in the 3462
enforcement of the judgment. 3463
Upon the filing of an entry of confirmation of sale or an 3464
order of forfeiture in a proceeding brought under this division, 3465
title to the manufactured or mobile home shall be in the 3466
purchaser. The clerk of courts shall issue a certificate of 3467
title to the purchaser upon presentation of proof of filing of 3468
the entry of confirmation or order and, in the case of a 3469
forfeiture, presentation of the county auditor's certificate of 3470
sale. 3471

auditor's service in assessing the taxes; two per cent shall be 3475
allowed as compensation to the county treasurer for the services 3476
the county treasurer renders as a result of the tax levied by 3477
this section. Such amounts shall be paid into the county 3478
treasury, to the credit of the county general revenue fund, on 3479
the warrant of the county auditor. Fees to be paid to the credit 3480
of the real estate assessment fund shall be collected pursuant 3481
to division (C) of section 319.54 of the Revised Code and paid 3482
into the county treasury, on the warrant of the county auditor. 3483
The balance of the taxes collected shall be distributed among 3484
the taxing subdivisions of the county in which the taxes are 3485
collected and paid in the same proportions that the amount of 3486
manufactured home tax levied by each taxing subdivision of the 3487
county in the current tax year bears to the amount of such tax 3488
levied by all such subdivisions in the county in the current tax 3489
year. The taxes levied and revenues collected under this section 3490
shall be in lieu of any general property tax and any tax levied 3491
with respect to the privilege of using or occupying a 3492
manufactured or mobile home in this state except as provided in 3493
sections 4503.04 and 5741.02 of the Revised Code. 3494
(J) An agreement to purchase or a bill of sale for a 3495
manufactured home shall show whether or not the furnishings and 3496
equipment are included in the purchase price. 3497
(K) If the county treasurer and the county prosecuting 3498
attorney agree that an item charged on the delinquent 3499
manufactured home tax list is uncollectible, they shall certify 3500
that determination and the reasons to the county board of 3501
revision. If the board determines the amount is uncollectible, 3502

it shall certify its determination to the county auditor, who 3503
shall strike the item from the list. 3504

affect the hearing and determination thereof. 3574
(M) If the county auditor determines that any tax or other 3575
charge or any part thereof has been erroneously charged as a 3576
result of a clerical error as defined in section 319.35 of the 3577

county board of revision to the erroneous charges. If the board 3579

charged or collected, it shall certify the finding to the 3581
auditor. Upon receipt of the certification, the auditor shall 3582
remove the erroneous charges on the manufactured home tax list 3583
or delinquent manufactured home tax list in the same manner as 3584

section, except that a single resolution may identify more than 4883
one parcel under that division if each parcel has the same 4884
record owner or the same record owners, as applicable. A 4885
legislative authority may adopt multiple resolutions required 4886

Before adopting a resolution required by division (A)(6) 4891

parcel or parcels identified in the resolution stating the 4894
intent of the legislative authority in adopting the resolution, 4895
the proposed date of adoption, and the basis for the complaint 4896

(A)(6)(b) of this section only if the legislative authority 4912
notifies the board of revision of the resolution in the manner 4913
prescribed in division (A)(8) of this section. The failure to 4914
accurately identify the street address or the name of the record 4915
owners of the parcel in the resolution does not invalidate the 4916
resolution nor is it a cause for dismissal of the complaint. 4917
(8) A complaint form prescribed by a board of revision or 4918

an officer, a salaried employee, a partner, a member, or trustee 4951
of that owner or tenant, may file a counter-complaint in support 4952
of or objecting to the amount of alleged overvaluation, 4953
undervaluation, discriminatory valuation, illegal valuation, or 4954
incorrect determination stated in a previously filed original 4955
complaint or objecting to the current valuation. 4956
A board of education may file a counter-complaint only if 4957
the original complaint states an amount of overvaluation, 4958
undervaluation, discriminatory valuation, illegal valuation, or 4959
incorrect determination of at least seventeen thousand five 4960
hundred dollars in taxable value. The board shall file the 4961
counter-complaint within thirty days after the original 4962
complaint is filed or after the last day such complaints may be 4963
filed, whichever is later, and any other person shall file the 4964
counter-complaint within thirty days after receiving the notice 4965

the action. 4969

a complaint may be filed with the board under division (A)(1) of 4980
this section or, if a counter-complaint is filed, within one 4981
hundred eighty days after such filing. If the original complaint 4982

mayor of a municipal corporation with territory in the county, 4984
or a third party complainant, and if the board of revision has 4985
not rendered its decision on the complaint within one year after 4986
the date the complaint was filed, the board may dismiss the 4987
complaint. 4988
(D) The determination of any such original complaint or 4989
counter-complaint shall relate back to the date when the lien 4990
for taxes or recoupment charges for the current year attached or 4991
the date as of which liability for such year was determined. 4992
Liability for taxes and recoupment charges for such year and 4993
each succeeding year until the complaint is finally determined 4994
and for any penalty and interest for nonpayment thereof within 4995
the time required by law shall be based upon the determination, 4996
valuation, or assessment as finally determined. Each complaint 4997
shall state the amount of overvaluation, undervaluation, 4998
discriminatory valuation, illegal valuation, or incorrect 4999
classification or determination upon which the complaint is 5000
based. The treasurer shall accept any amount tendered as taxes 5001
or recoupment charge upon property concerning which a complaint 5002

by the board within the time prescribed for such determination, 5007
the complaint and any proceedings in relation thereto shall be 5008
continued by the board as a valid complaint for any ensuing year 5009
until that original complaint or counter-complaint is finally 5010
determined by the board or upon any appeal from a decision of 5011
the board. In such case, the original complaint and counter- 5012
complaint shall continue in effect without further filing by the 5013
original taxpayer, the original taxpayer's assignee, or any 5014
other person or entity authorized to file a complaint under this 5015
section. 5016
(E) If a taxpayer files a complaint as to the 5017
classification, valuation, assessment, or any determination 5018
affecting the taxpayer's own property and tenders less than the 5019
full amount of taxes or recoupment charges as finally 5020
determined, an interest charge shall accrue as follows: 5021
(1) If the amount finally determined is less than the 5022
amount billed but more than the amount tendered, the taxpayer 5023
shall pay interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5024
5703.47 of the Revised Code, computed from the date that the 5025
taxes were due on the difference between the amount finally 5026
determined and the amount tendered. This interest charge shall 5027
be in lieu of any penalty or interest charge under section 5028
323.121 of the Revised Code unless the taxpayer failed to file a 5029
complaint and tender an amount as taxes or recoupment charges 5030
within the time required by this section, in which case section 5031
323.121 of the Revised Code applies. 5032
(2) If the amount of taxes finally determined is equal to 5033

by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date the taxes 5036
were due on the difference between the amount finally determined 5037
and the amount tendered, such interest to be in lieu of any 5038
interest charge but in addition to any penalty prescribed by 5039
section 323.121 of the Revised Code. 5040
(F) Upon request of a complainant, the tax commissioner 5041
shall determine the common level of assessment of real property 5042

valued under section 5713.31 of the Revised Code, which common 5044
level of assessment shall be expressed as a percentage of true 5045
value and the common level of assessment of lands valued under 5046
such section, which common level of assessment shall also be 5047
expressed as a percentage of the current agricultural use value 5048
of such lands. Such determination shall be made on the basis of 5049
the most recent available sales ratio studies of the 5050
commissioner and such other factual data as the commissioner 5051
deems pertinent. 5052
(G) A complainant shall provide to the board of revision 5053
all information or evidence within the complainant's knowledge 5054
or possession that affects the real property that is the subject 5055
of the complaint. A complainant who fails to provide such 5056
information or evidence is precluded from introducing it on 5057
appeal to the board of tax appeals or the court of common pleas, 5058
except that the board of tax appeals or court may admit and 5059
consider the evidence if the complainant shows good cause for 5060
the complainant's failure to provide the information or evidence 5061
to the board of revision. 5062

valuation or incorrect classification or determination, the 5065
taxpayer may tender to the treasurer an amount as taxes upon 5066
property computed upon the claimed valuation as set forth in the 5067
complaint to the court. The treasurer may accept the tender. If 5068
the tender is not accepted, no penalty shall be assessed because 5069
of the nonpayment of the full taxes assessed. 5070
(I) A legislative authority may not enter into a private 5071
payment agreement with respect to any complaint filed or 5072

(2) Dismissing a complaint or counter-complaint filed by 5084
the legislative authority under this section; 5085

agreement to resolve a claim under this section pursuant to 5089
which an agreed-upon valuation for the property that is the 5090
subject of the claim is approved by the county auditor and 5091
reflected on the tax list, provided that agreement does not 5092

agent, the vendor or the vendor's agent shall collect the tax 7240
with and at the same time as the price; 7241
(2) If the price is otherwise paid or to be paid, the 7242
vendor or the vendor's agent shall, at or prior to the provision 7243
of the service or the delivery of possession of the thing sold 7244
to the consumer, charge the tax imposed by or pursuant to 7245
section 5739.02, 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 of the Revised 7246
Code to the account of the consumer, which amount shall be 7247
collected by the vendor from the consumer in addition to the 7248
price. Such sale shall be reported on and the amount of the tax 7249
applicable thereto shall be remitted with the return for the 7250
period in which the sale is made, and the amount of the tax 7251
shall become a legal charge in favor of the vendor and against 7252
the consumer. 7253

(B)(1)(a) If any sale is claimed to be exempt under 7254
division (E) of section 5739.01 of the Revised Code or under 7255
section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, with the exception of 7256
divisions (B)(1) to (11), (28), (48), (55),or (59), or (66) of 7257
section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, the consumer must provide 7258
to the vendor, and the vendor must obtain from the consumer, a 7259
certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally 7260
subject to the tax. The certificate shall be in such form, and 7261
shall be provided either in a hard copy form or electronic form, 7262
as the tax commissioner prescribes. 7263
(b) A vendor that obtains a fully completed exemption 7264
certificate from a consumer is relieved of liability for 7265
collecting and remitting tax on any sale covered by that 7266
certificate. If it is determined the exemption was improperly 7267
claimed, the consumer shall be liable for any tax due on that 7268
sale under section 5739.02, 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 or 7269
Chapter 5741. of the Revised Code. Relief under this division 7270
from liability does not apply to any of the following: 7271
(i) A vendor that fraudulently fails to collect tax; 7272
(ii) A vendor that solicits consumers to participate in 7273
the unlawful claim of an exemption; 7274
(iii) A vendor that accepts an exemption certificate from 7275
a consumer that claims an exemption based on who purchases or 7276
who sells property or a service, when the subject of the 7277
transaction sought to be covered by the exemption certificate is 7278
actually received by the consumer at a location operated by the 7279
vendor in this state, and this state has posted to its web site 7280
an exemption certificate form that clearly and affirmatively 7281
indicates that the claimed exemption is not available in this 7282
state; 7283

As Introduced
(iv) A vendor that accepts an exemption certificate from a 7284
consumer who claims a multiple points of use exemption under 7285
division (D) of section 5739.033 of the Revised Code, if the 7286
item purchased is tangible personal property, other than 7287
prewritten computer software. 7288
(2) The vendor shall maintain records, including exemption 7289
certificates, of all sales on which a consumer has claimed an 7290
exemption, and provide them to the tax commissioner on request. 7291
(3) The tax commissioner may establish an identification 7292
system whereby the commissioner issues an identification number 7293
to a consumer that is exempt from payment of the tax. The 7294
consumer must present the number to the vendor, if any sale is 7295
claimed to be exempt as provided in this section. 7296
(4) If no certificate is provided or obtained within 7297
ninety days after the date on which such sale is consummated, it 7298
shall be presumed that the tax applies. Failure to have so 7299
provided or obtained a certificate shall not preclude a vendor, 7300
within one hundred twenty days after the tax commissioner gives 7301
written notice of intent to levy an assessment, from either 7302
establishing that the sale is not subject to the tax, or 7303
obtaining, in good faith, a fully completed exemption 7304
certificate. 7305
(5) Certificates need not be obtained nor provided where 7306
the identity of the consumer is such that the transaction is 7307
never subject to the tax imposed or where the item of tangible 7308
personal property sold or the service provided is never subject 7309
to the tax imposed, regardless of use, or when the sale is in 7310
interstate commerce. 7311
(6) If a transaction is claimed to be exempt under 7312

S. B. No. 190 Page 251
As Introduced
division (B)(13) of section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, the 7313
contractor shall obtain certification of the claimed exemption 7314
from the contractee. This certification shall be in addition to 7315
an exemption certificate provided by the contractor to the 7316
vendor. A contractee that provides a certification under this 7317
division shall be deemed to be the consumer of all items 7318
purchased by the contractor under the claim of exemption, if it 7319
is subsequently determined that the exemption is not properly 7320
claimed. The certification shall be in such form as the tax 7321
commissioner prescribes. 7322
(7) If a transaction is claimed to be exempt under 7323
division (B)(13) of section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, the 7324
person that leases a sports facility, as defined in section 7325
307.696 of the Revised Code, wholly owned by a county may 7326
provide and sign, on behalf of the county, an exemption 7327
certificate required under this section for that exemption. 7328
(C) As used in this division, "contractee" means a person 7329
who seeks to enter or enters into a contract or agreement with a 7330
contractor or vendor for the construction of real property or 7331
for the sale and installation onto real property of tangible 7332
personal property. 7333
Any contractor or vendor may request from any contractee a 7334
certification of what portion of the property to be transferred 7335
under such contract or agreement is to be incorporated into the 7336
realty and what portion will retain its status as tangible 7337
personal property after installation is completed. The 7338
contractor or vendor shall request the certification by 7339
certified mail delivered to the contractee, return receipt 7340
requested. Upon receipt of such request and prior to entering 7341
into the contract or agreement, the contractee shall provide to 7342

S. B. No. 190 Page 252
As Introduced
the contractor or vendor a certification sufficiently detailed 7343
to enable the contractor or vendor to ascertain the resulting 7344
classification of all materials purchased or fabricated by the 7345
contractor or vendor and transferred to the contractee. This 7346
requirement applies to a contractee regardless of whether the 7347
contractee holds a direct payment permit under section 5739.031 7348
of the Revised Code or provides to the contractor or vendor an 7349
exemption certificate as provided under this section. 7350
For the purposes of the taxes levied by this chapter and 7351
Chapter 5741. of the Revised Code, the contractor or vendor may 7352
in good faith rely on the contractee's certification. 7353
Notwithstanding division (B) of section 5739.01 of the Revised 7354
Code, if the tax commissioner determines that certain property 7355
certified by the contractee as tangible personal property 7356
pursuant to this division is, in fact, real property, the 7357
contractee shall be considered to be the consumer of all 7358
materials so incorporated into that real property and shall be 7359
liable for the applicable tax, and the contractor or vendor 7360
shall be excused from any liability on those materials. 7361
If a contractee fails to provide such certification upon 7362
the request of the contractor or vendor, the contractor or 7363
vendor shall comply with the provisions of this chapter and 7364
Chapter 5741. of the Revised Code without the certification. If 7365
the tax commissioner determines that such compliance has been 7366
performed in good faith and that certain property treated as 7367
tangible personal property by the contractor or vendor is, in 7368
fact, real property, the contractee shall be considered to be 7369
the consumer of all materials so incorporated into that real 7370
property and shall be liable for the applicable tax, and the 7371
construction contractor or vendor shall be excused from any 7372
liability on those materials. 7373

S. B. No. 190 Page 253
As Introduced
This division does not apply to any contract or agreement 7374
where the tax commissioner determines as a fact that a 7375
certification under this division was made solely on the 7376
decision or advice of the contractor or vendor. 7377
(D) Notwithstanding division (B) of section 5739.01 of the 7378
Revised Code, whenever the total rate of tax imposed under this 7379
chapter is increased after the date after a construction 7380
contract is entered into, the contractee shall reimburse the 7381
construction contractor for any additional tax paid on tangible 7382
property consumed or services received pursuant to the contract. 7383
(E) A vendor who files a petition for reassessment 7384
contesting the assessment of tax on sales for which the vendor 7385
obtained no valid exemption certificates and for which the 7386
vendor failed to establish that the sales were properly not 7387
subject to the tax during the one-hundred-twenty-day period 7388
allowed under division (B) of this section, may present to the 7389
tax commissioner additional evidence to prove that the sales 7390
were properly subject to a claim of exception or exemption. The 7391
vendor shall file such evidence within ninety days of the 7392
receipt by the vendor of the notice of assessment, except that, 7393
upon application and for reasonable cause, the period for 7394
submitting such evidence shall be extended thirty days. 7395
The commissioner shall consider such additional evidence 7396
in reaching the final determination on the assessment and 7397
petition for reassessment. 7398
(F) Whenever a vendor refunds the price, minus any 7399
separately stated delivery charge, of an item of tangible 7400
personal property on which the tax imposed under this chapter 7401
has been paid, the vendor shall also refund the amount of tax 7402
paid, minus the amount of tax attributable to the delivery 7403

charge. 7404
Sec. 5739.05. (A)(1)(A) The tax commissioner shall enforce 7405
and administer sections 5739.01 to 5739.31 of the Revised Code, 7406
which are hereby declared to be sections which the commissioner 7407
is required to administer within the meaning of sections 5703.17 7408
to 5703.37, 5703.39, 5703.41, and 5703.45 of the Revised Code. 7409
The commissioner may adopt and promulgate, in accordance with 7410
sections 119.01 to 119.13 of the Revised Code, such rules as the 7411
commissioner deems necessary to administer sections 5739.01 to 7412
5739.31 of the Revised Code. 7413
(2) On or before the first day of May of each year, the 7414
commissioner shall make available to vendors a notice explaining 7415
the three-day exemption period required under division (B)(55) 7416
of section 5739.02 of the Revised Code. 7417
(B) Upon application, the commissioner may authorize a 7418
vendor to pay on a predetermined basis the tax levied by or 7419
pursuant to section 5739.02, 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 of 7420
the Revised Code upon sales of things produced or distributed or 7421
services provided by such vendor, and the commissioner may waive 7422
the collection of the tax from the consumer. The commissioner 7423
shall not grant such authority unless the commissioner finds 7424
that the granting of the authority would improve compliance and 7425
increase the efficiency of the administration of the tax. The 7426
person to whom such authority is granted shall post a notice, if 7427
required by the commissioner, at the location where the product 7428
is offered for sale that the tax is included in the selling 7429
price. The commissioner may adopt rules to administer this 7430
division. 7431
(C) Upon application, the commissioner may authorize a 7432
vendor to remit, on the basis of a prearranged agreement under 7433

S. B. No. 190 Page 255
As Introduced
this division, the tax levied by section 5739.02 or pursuant to 7434
section 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 of the Revised Code. The 7435
proportions and ratios in a prearranged agreement shall be 7436
determined either by a test check conducted by the commissioner 7437
under terms and conditions agreed to by the commissioner and the 7438
vendor or by any other method agreed upon by the vendor and the 7439
commissioner. If the parties are unable to agree to the terms 7440
and conditions of the test check or other method, the 7441
application shall be denied. 7442
If used, the test check shall determine the proportion 7443
that taxable retail sales bear to all of the vendor's retail 7444
sales and the ratio which the tax required to be collected under 7445
sections 5739.02, 5739.021, 5739.023, and 5739.026 of the 7446
Revised Code bears to the receipts from the vendor's taxable 7447
retail sales. 7448
The vendor's liability for remitting the tax shall be 7449
based solely upon the proportions and ratios established in the 7450
agreement until such time that the vendor or the commissioner 7451
believes that the nature of the vendor's business has so changed 7452
as to make the agreement no longer representative. The 7453
commissioner may give notice to the vendor at any time that the 7454
authorization is revoked or the vendor may notify the 7455
commissioner that the vendor no longer elects to report under 7456
the authorization. Such notice shall be delivered to the other 7457
party in the manner provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised 7458
Code. The revocation or cancellation is effective the last day 7459
of the month in which the vendor or the commissioner receives 7460
the notice. 7461
Sec. 5739.08. (A) A municipal corporation or township may 7462
levy an excise tax for any lawful purpose not to exceed three 7463

term rental property is or is to be furnished to transient 7465
guests in addition to the tax levied by section 5739.02 of the 7466
Revised Code. If a municipal corporation or township repeals a 7467
tax imposed under division (A) of this section, and a county in 7468
which the municipal corporation or township has territory has a 7469
tax imposed under division (M) of section 5739.09 of the Revised 7470
Code in effect, the municipal corporation or township may not 7471
reimpose its tax as long as that county tax remains in effect. A 7472
municipal corporation or township in which a tax is levied under 7473
division (B)(2) of section 351.021 of the Revised Code may not 7474
increase the rate of its tax levied under division (A) of this 7475
section to any rate that would cause the total taxes levied 7476
under both of those divisions to exceed three per cent on any 7477
lodging transaction within the municipal corporation or 7478
township. 7479
(B) The legislative authority of a municipal corporation 7480
or the board of trustees of a township that is not wholly or 7481
partly located in a county that has in effect a resolution 7482
levying an excise tax pursuant to division (A) of section 7483
5739.09 of the Revised Code may, by ordinance or resolution, 7484
levy an additional excise tax not to exceed three per cent on 7485
transactions by which lodging by a hotel or short-term rental 7486
property is or is to be furnished to transient guests. The 7487
legislative authority of the municipal corporation or the board 7488
of trustees of the township shall deposit at least fifty per 7489
cent of the revenue from the tax levied pursuant to this 7490
division into a separate fund, which shall be spent solely to 7491
make contributions to convention and visitors' bureaus operating 7492
within the county in which the municipal corporation or township 7493
is wholly or partly located, and the balance of that revenue 7494

S. B. No. 190 Page 257
As Introduced
shall be deposited in the general fund. The municipal 7495
corporation or township shall establish all regulations 7496
necessary to provide for the administration and allocation of 7497
the tax. The regulations may prescribe the time for payment of 7498
the tax, and may provide for the imposition of a penalty or 7499
interest, or both, for late payments, provided that the penalty 7500
does not exceed ten per cent of the amount of tax due, and the 7501
rate at which interest accrues does not exceed the rate per 7502
annum prescribed pursuant to section 5703.47 of the Revised 7503
Code. The levy of a tax under this division is in addition to 7504
any tax imposed on the same transaction by a municipal 7505
corporation or a township under division (A) of this section. 7506
(C)(1) As used in division (C) of this section, "cost" has 7507
the same meaning as in section 351.01 of the Revised Code, and 7508
"convention center" has the same meaning as in section 307.695 7509
of the Revised Code. 7510
(2) The legislative authority of the most populous 7511
municipal corporation located wholly or partly in a county in 7512

division (D) of section 5739.09 of the Revised Code may amend, 7514
on or before September 30, 2002, that municipal corporation's 7515
ordinance or resolution that levies an excise tax on 7516

property is or is to be furnished to transient guests, to 7518
provide for all of the following: 7519
(a) That the rate of the tax shall be increased by not 7520
more than an additional one per cent on each transaction; 7521

(c) That the increase in rate shall not be subject to 7530
diminution by initiative or referendum or by law while any 7531
bonds, or notes in anticipation of bonds, issued by the 7532
authority under Chapter 351. of the Revised Code to which the 7533
revenue is pledged, remain outstanding in accordance with their 7534
terms, unless provision is made by law, by the board of county 7535
commissioners, or by the legislative authority, for an adequate 7536
substitute therefor that is satisfactory to the trustee if a 7537
trust agreement secures the bonds. 7538
(3) The legislative authority of a municipal corporation 7539
that, pursuant to division (C)(2) of this section, has amended 7540
its ordinance or resolution to increase the rate of the tax 7541
authorized by division (B) of this section may further amend the 7542

more than an additional three per cent on each transaction; 7568
(2) That all of the revenue from the increase in rate 7569

August of each year, the tax commissioner shall make a new 10316
adjustment to the income amounts prescribed in divisions (A)(2) 10317

section 5747.025 of the Revised Code by each of the income 10320
amounts resulting from the adjustment under this division in the 10321
preceding year, adding the resulting product to the 10322
corresponding income amount resulting from the adjustment in the 10323
preceding year, and rounding the resulting sum to the nearest 10324
multiple of fifty dollars. The tax commissioner also shall 10325
recompute each of the tax dollar amounts to the extent necessary 10326

to reflect the new adjustment of the income amounts. To 10327
recompute the tax dollar amount corresponding to the lowest tax 10328
rate in division (A)(3) of this section, the commissioner shall 10329
multiply the tax rate prescribed in division (A)(2) of this 10330
section by the income amount specified in that division and as 10331
adjusted according to this paragraph. The rates of taxation 10332
shall not be adjusted. 10333
The adjusted amounts apply to taxable years beginning in 10334
the calendar year in which the adjustments are made and to 10335
taxable years beginning in each ensuing calendar year until a 10336
calendar year in which a new adjustment is made pursuant to this 10337
division. The tax commissioner shall not make a new adjustment 10338

would be less than the amount resulting from the adjustment in 10340
the preceding year. 10341
(B) If the director of budget and management makes a 10342

for taxable years beginning in the calendar year in which that 10347

rate, based on modified Ohio taxable income, multiplied by the 10359
resident trust's modified nonbusiness income other than the 10360
portion of the resident trust's nonbusiness income that is 10361
qualifying investment income. The credit applies before any 10362
other applicable credits. 10363
(3) Any credit authorized against the tax imposed by this 10364
section applies to a trust subject to division (C)(B) of this 10365
section only if the trust otherwise qualifies for the credit. To 10366
the extent that the trust distributes income for the taxable 10367
year for which a credit is available to the trust, the credit 10368
shall be shared by the trust and its beneficiaries. The tax 10369

regulations of the United States treasury regarding the sharing 10371
of credits. 10372

section 5747.05 and divisions (F) and (G) of section 5747.055 of 10529
the Revised Code for the year are equal to or exceed the tax 10530

those pass-through entity investor's income taxable in this 10554

pass-through entity elects to file a single return are not 10557
entitled to the exemption or credit provided for by sections 10558
5747.02 and 5747.022 of the Revised Code; shall calculate the 10559
tax before business credits at the highest rate of tax set forth 10560

single return any investor that is a trust to the extent that 10570
any direct or indirect current, future, or contingent 10571
beneficiary of the trust is a person subject to the tax imposed 10572

section 5733.06 of the Revised Code. 10578
(c) Except as provided by division (L) of this section, 10579
nothing in division (D) of this section precludes the tax 10580
commissioner from requiring such investors to file the return 10581

interest penalty required by this section or section 5747.02, 10583

annual return under this section, utilizing the refundable 10586
credit equal to the investor's proportionate share of the tax 10587
paid by the pass-through entity on behalf of the investor under 10588

(m) The earned income tax credit under section 5747.71 of 10627

(3) The election provided for under division (D) of this 10637
section applies only to the taxable year for which the election 10638
is made by the pass-through entity. Unless the tax commissioner 10639
provides otherwise, this election, once made, is binding and 10640
irrevocable for the taxable year for which the election is made. 10641
Nothing in this division shall be construed to provide for any 10642
deduction or credit that would not be allowable if a nonresident 10643
pass-through entity investor were to file an annual return. 10644
(4) If a pass-through entity makes the election provided 10645
for under division (D) of this section, the pass-through entity 10646
shall be liable for any additional taxes, interest, interest 10647
penalty, or penalties imposed by this chapter if the tax 10648
commissioner finds that the single return does not reflect the 10649
correct tax due by the pass-through entity investors covered by 10650
that return. Nothing in this division shall be construed to 10651

interest penalty, or penalties as a result of the pass-through 10654
entity's making the election provided for under division (D) of 10655
this section. For the purposes of division (D) of this section, 10656
"correct tax due" means the tax that would have been paid by the 10657
pass-through entity had the single return been filed in a manner 10658
reflecting the commissioner's findings. Nothing in division (D) 10659
of this section shall be construed to make or hold a pass- 10660
through entity liable for tax attributable to a pass-through 10661
entity investor's income from a source other than the pass- 10662
through entity electing to file the single return. 10663
(E) If a husband and wife file a joint federal income tax 10664
return for a taxable year, they shall file a joint return under 10665
this section for that taxable year, and their liabilities are 10666
joint and several, but, if the federal income tax liability of 10667
either spouse is determined on a separate federal income tax 10668
return, they shall file separate returns under this section. 10669
If either spouse is not required to file a federal income 10670
tax return and either or both are required to file a return 10671
pursuant to this chapter, they may elect to file separate or 10672
joint returns, and, pursuant to that election, their liabilities 10673
are separate or joint and several. If a husband and wife file 10674
separate returns pursuant to this chapter, each must claim the 10675
taxpayer's own exemption, but not both, as authorized under 10676
section 5747.02 of the Revised Code on the taxpayer's own 10677
return. 10678
(F) Each return or notice required to be filed under this 10679
section shall contain the signature of the taxpayer or the 10680
taxpayer's duly authorized agent and of the person who prepared 10681

social security number. Each return shall be verified by a 10683
declaration under the penalties of perjury. The tax commissioner 10684
shall prescribe the form that the signature and declaration 10685
shall take. 10686
(G) Each return or notice required to be filed under this 10687
section shall be made and filed as required by section 5747.04 10688
of the Revised Code, on or before the fifteenth day of April of 10689
each year, on forms that the tax commissioner shall prescribe, 10690
together with remittance made payable to the treasurer of state 10691
in the combined amount of the state and all school district 10692
income taxes shown to be due on the form. 10693
Upon good cause shown, the commissioner may extend the 10694
period for filing any notice or return required to be filed 10695
under this section and may adopt rules relating to extensions. 10696
If the extension results in an extension of time for the payment 10697
of any state or school district income tax liability with 10698
respect to which the return is filed, the taxpayer shall pay at 10699
the time the tax liability is paid an amount of interest 10700
computed at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of 10701
the Revised Code on that liability from the time that payment is 10702
due without extension to the time of actual payment. Except as 10703
provided in section 5747.132 of the Revised Code, in addition to 10704
all other interest charges and penalties, all taxes imposed 10705
under this chapter or Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code and 10706
remaining unpaid after they become due, except combined amounts 10707
due of one dollar or less, bear interest at the rate per annum 10708
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code until paid or 10709
until the day an assessment is issued under section 5747.13 of 10710
the Revised Code, whichever occurs first. 10711

If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to 10712
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by section 5747.02 of the 10713
Revised Code or any tax imposed under Chapter 5748. of the 10714
Revised Code, the commissioner may require returns and payments 10715
to be made otherwise than as provided in this section. 10716
To the extent that any provision in this division 10717
conflicts with any provision in section 5747.026 of the Revised 10718
Code, the provision in that section prevails. 10719
(H) The amounts withheld pursuant to section 5747.06, 10720
5747.062, 5747.063, 5747.064, 5747.065, or 5747.071 of the 10721
Revised Code shall be allowed to the ultimate recipient of the 10722
income as credits against payment of the appropriate taxes 10723
imposed on the ultimate recipient by section 5747.02 and under 10724
Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code. As used in this division, 10725
"ultimate recipient" means the person who is required to report 10726
income from which amounts are withheld pursuant to section 10727
5747.06, 5747.062, 5747.063, 5747.064, 5747.065, or 5747.071 of 10728
the Revised Code on the annual return required to be filed under 10729
this section. 10730
(I) If a pass-through entity elects to file a single 10731
return under division (D) of this section and if any investor is 10732
required to file the annual return and make the payment of taxes 10733
required by this chapter on account of the investor's other 10734
income that is not included in a single return filed by a pass- 10735
through entity or any other investor elects to file the annual 10736
return, the investor is entitled to a refundable credit equal to 10737
the investor's proportionate share of the tax paid by the pass- 10738
through entity on behalf of the investor. The investor shall 10739
claim the credit for the investor's taxable year in which or 10740
with which ends the taxable year of the pass-through entity. 10741

S. B. No. 190 Page 368
As Introduced
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow any credit 10742
provided in this chapter to be claimed more than once. For the 10743
purpose of computing any interest, penalty, or interest penalty, 10744
the investor shall be deemed to have paid the refundable credit 10745
provided by this division on the day that the pass-through 10746
entity paid the estimated tax or the tax giving rise to the 10747
credit. 10748
(J) The tax commissioner shall ensure that each return 10749
required to be filed under this section includes a box that the 10750
taxpayer may check to authorize a paid tax preparer who prepared 10751
the return to communicate with the department of taxation about 10752
matters pertaining to the return. The return or instructions 10753
accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box 10754
the taxpayer authorizes the department of taxation to contact 10755
the preparer concerning questions that arise during the 10756
processing of the return and authorizes the preparer only to 10757
provide the department with information that is missing from the 10758
return, to contact the department for information about the 10759
processing of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund 10760
or payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical 10761
errors, offsets, or return preparation that the taxpayer has 10762
received from the department and has shown to the preparer. 10763
(K) The tax commissioner shall permit individual taxpayers 10764
to instruct the department of taxation to cause any refund of 10765
overpaid taxes to be deposited directly into a checking account, 10766
savings account, or an individual retirement account or 10767
individual retirement annuity, or preexisting college savings 10768
plan or program account offered by the Ohio tuition trust 10769
authority under Chapter 3334. of the Revised Code, as designated 10770
by the taxpayer, when the taxpayer files the annual return 10771
required by this section electronically. 10772

is the owner of an electing pass-through entity, as defined in 10774
section 5747.38 of the Revised Code, does not have Ohio adjusted 10775
gross income or, in the case of a trust, modified Ohio taxable 10776
income other than from one or more electing pass-through 10777
entities, the nonresident or trust shall not be required to file 10778
an annual return under this section. Nothing in this division 10779
precludes such an owner from filing the annual return under this 10780
section, utilizing the refundable credit under section 5747.39 10781
of the Revised Code equal to the owner's proportionate share of 10782
the tax levied under section 5747.38 of the Revised Code and 10783
paid by the electing pass-through entity, and making the payment 10784

Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit or rebate 11269
shall equal one of the following: 11270
(1) For eligible claimants who own the homestead for which 11271
the claim is made, the amount by which the eligible claimant's 11272

claimant's total household resources for that claim year. 11274
(2) For eligible claimants who lease the homestead for 11275
which the claim is made, the amount by which the eligible 11276
claimant's rent-equivalent tax paid in the claim year exceeds 11277
five per cent of the eligible claimant's total household 11278
resources for that year. 11279
(C) The credit or rebate allowed under this section for a 11280

on that form after the first day of January following the end of 11299
the claim year but before the fifteenth day of the fourth month 11300
following the end of that claim year. 11301
(2) An eligible claimant may request an extension of the 11302
time to file a rebate application under division (E)(1) of this 11303
section, on a form prescribed by the commissioner. Upon receipt 11304
of such a request, the commissioner shall extend the due date 11305
for filing the application to the fifteenth day of the tenth 11306
month after the last day of the claim year. 11307
(F)(1) The credit or rebate authorized under this section 11308
shall be allowed to only one eligible claimant per homestead. 11309

effective date of this section, an individual qualifies as an 11313
eligible claimant only if the individual's total household 11314
resources do not exceed sixty thousand dollars. For each 11315
following claim year, the tax commissioner shall adjust this 11316
total household resources limit and the credit or rebate limit 11317
described in division (C) of this section by completing the 11318
following calculations in September of each year: 11319
(1) Determine the percentage increase in the gross 11320

first day of January of the preceding year to the last day of 11323

S. B. No. 190 Page 388

December of the preceding year; 11324
(2) Multiply that percentage increase by the total 11325
household resources limit and the credit or rebate limit for the 11326
current year; 11327
(3) Add the resulting products to the respective limits 11328
for the current year; 11329
(4) Round the resulting sums to the nearest multiple of 11330
one thousand dollars, in the case of the total household 11331
resources limit, or nearest multiple of ten dollars, in the case 11332
of the credit limit. 11333
The adjusted amounts apply to claim years beginning in the 11334
calendar year in which the adjustment is made and to claim years 11335
beginning in each ensuing calendar year until a calendar year in 11336
which a new adjustment is made pursuant to this division. The 11337
commissioner shall not make a new adjustment in any calendar 11338
year in which the amount resulting from the adjustment would be 11339
less than the amount resulting from the adjustment in the 11340
preceding calendar year. 11341
(H) If a credit or rebate allowed under this section was 11342
based on an amount of property tax due that differs from the 11343
actual amount of such taxes paid by the eligible claimant for 11344
the tax year ending in that claim year, the eligible claimant 11345
shall file an annual return or application under division (E) of 11346
this section for the ensuing claim year that reports the 11347
difference. The claimant shall adjust the credit or rebate 11348
claimed for the ensuing year by the amount of the difference. If 11349
the claimant is not eligible for the credit or rebate for the 11350
ensuing claim year, the claimant shall pay or may request 11351
payment of the difference, as applicable. 11352

which the refund arose. 11755
(3) After the director of budget and management makes any 11756
transfer required by division (H)(2) of this section, but not 11757

determination. If the petition has been properly filed, the 11814
commissioner shall proceed under section 5703.60 of the Revised 11815

days after the day the assessment is issued, the portion of the 11836
assessment consisting of tax due or amounts due under section 11837
1509.50 of the Revised Code shall bear interest at the rate per 11838

the assessment shall bear interest at the rate per annum 11845
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date 11846
of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. 11847

computed in accordance with section 5703.47 of the Revised Code 11871
from the date of the payment of an erroneous or illegal 11872
assessment until the date the refund is paid. If the amount is 11873
not less than that claimed, the commissioner shall certify the 11874
amount to the director of budget and management and treasurer of 11875
state for payment from the tax refund fund created by section 11876

person or property, or do any other act tending to prejudice or 11885
to render wholly or partly ineffectual proceedings to collect 11886
such tax or other amount due unless such proceedings are brought 11887
without delay, or if the commissioner believes that the 11888
collection of the tax or amount due from any taxpayer person 11889
will be jeopardized by delay, the commissioner shall give notice 11890
of such findings to such taxpayer the person together with the 11891
demand for an immediate return and immediate payment of such tax 11892
or other amount due, with penalty as provided in section 5749.15 11893
