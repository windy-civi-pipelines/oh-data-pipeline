Section 1:
(136th General Assembly)
(Senate Resolution Number 68)
A RESOLUTION
To support moving NASA headquarters to Ohio.
Be it resolved by the Senate of the State of Ohio:
pioneers in space exploration, including more astronauts than any other state; and
WHEREAS, Ohio continues to lead the nation in aerospace research and development and is home
to world-class research institutions such as NASA Glenn Research Center, NASA Neil Armstrong Test

manufacturing sector make Ohio a strategic location to support NASA's operations; and

prospective locations for NASA headquarters; and
WHEREAS, Relocating NASA headquarters to Ohio would honor Ohio's contributions to
aerospace and space exploration, reinforce Ohio's position as an international leader in space
exploration and aeronautics innovation, and best position NASA for sustained success; now therefore
be it
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the Senate of the 136th General Assembly of Ohio, strongly
encourage President Trump, Vice President Vance, and NASA Administrator Designate Isaacman to
relocate NASA headquarters to Ohio; and be it further
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit duly authenticated copies of this resolution to
