real property and the various classes thereof in the county as 141
shown in the auditor's abstract were assessed for taxation and 142
the true and agricultural use values were recorded on the 143
agricultural land tax list as required by law. In the case of an 144
appeal filed under division (A)(2) of that section, the taxes 145

taxing district under section 5715.24 of the Revised Code by 148
using the representative sampling of sales provided by the 149
county auditor without adjustment. 150
(2) If as a result of the appeal to the board it is 151
finally determined either that adjustments are required to an 152
auditor's representative sampling of sales, that all real 153
property and the various classes thereof have not been assessed 154
as required by law, or that the values set forth in the 155
agricultural land tax list do not correctly reflect the true and 156
agricultural use values of the lands contained therein, the 157
county auditor shall forthwith add to or deduct from each tract, 158
lot, or parcel of real property or class of real property the 159
required percentage or amount of the valuation in accordance 160
with the order of the board or judgment of the court to which 161
the board's order was appealed, and the taxes on each tract, 162
lot, or parcel and the percentages required by section 319.301 163
of the Revised Code shall be recomputed using the valuation as 164

determination shall prescribe the time and manner for 166
collecting, crediting, or refunding the resultant increases or 167
decreases in taxes. 168
