improvement described in division (G)(1) of this section may be 408
paid from a fund into which may be paid special assessments 409
levied under this section against the lots and parcels of land 410
in the area to be benefited by the improvement, if the board 411
finds that the improvement will result in general or special 412
benefits to the benefited area. These special assessments shall 413
be levied not more than one time on the same lot or parcel of 414
land. Such costs and expenses may also be paid from the treasury 415

board finds appropriate. 417
(3) The board shall levy special assessments at an amount 418
not to exceed ten per cent of the assessable value of the lot or 419
parcel of land being assessed. The board shall determine the 420
assessable value of a lot or parcel of land in the following 421
manner: the board shall first determine the fair market value of 422
the lot or parcel being assessed in the calendar year in which 423
the area to be benefited by the public improvement is first 424
designated and then multiply this amount by the average rate of 425
appreciation in value of the lot or parcel since that calendar 426
year. The assessable value of the lot or parcel is the current 427
fair market value of the lot or parcel minus the amount 428
H. B. No. 49 Page 16
As Introduced
calculated in the manner described in the immediately preceding 429
sentence. The board may adjust the assessable value of a lot or 430
parcel of land to reflect a sale of the lot or parcel that 431
indicates an appreciation in its value that exceeds its average 432
rate of appreciation in value. 433
(4) Special assessments levied by the board may be paid in 434
full in a lump sum or may be paid and collected in equal 435
semiannual installments, equal in number to twice the number of 436
years for which the lease of the improvement is made or twice 437
the number of years that the note, bond, instrument, or 438
obligation that the assessments are pledged to pay requires. The 439
assessments shall be paid and collected in the same manner and 440
at the same time as real property taxes are paid and collected, 441
and assessments in the amount of fifty dollars or less shall be 442
paid in full, and not in installments, at the time the first or 443
next installment would otherwise become due and payable. 444
Complaints regarding assessments may be made to the county board 445
of revision in the same manner as complaints relating to the 446
valuation and assessment of real property. 447
Credits against assessments shall be granted equal to the 448

to such bonds shall be governed by the provisions of this 715
chapter insofar as they are applicable and by the applicable 716
bond proceedings. 717
Sec. 6120.08. This chapter provides an additional and 718
alternative method for financing, constructing, reconstructing, 719
or repairing projects and taking the actions authorized by this 720
chapter. This chapter shall be regarded as supplemental and 721
additional to powers conferred by other laws. The issuance of 722
bonds under this chapter need not comply with any other law 723
applicable to the issuance of bonds. 724
Sec. 6120.09. (A) The bonds do not constitute a debt, or a 725
pledge of the faith and credit, of the state or of any political 726

may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders as is 762
customary in revenue bond trust agreements of public bodies, and 763

reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All 765
expenses incurred in entering into or carrying out the 766
provisions of any such trust agreement may be treated as a part 767

provide such reserves therefor as are provided for in the bond 775
proceedings authorizing the issuance of those outstanding bonds, 776
and otherwise as provided by the board of trustees of the 777
district, and the balance of the pledged revenues shall be set 778
aside, at such regular intervals as are provided in the bond 779
proceedings in a bond service fund which is hereby pledged to 780
and charged with the payment of the bond service charges on any 781
such outstanding bonds as provided in the applicable bond 782
proceedings. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the 783

thereafter received by the board shall immediately be subject to 785
the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or 786
further act, and the lien of such pledge shall be valid and 787
binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in 788

credit of a bond service fund shall be subject to the applicable 793
bond proceedings. Except as is otherwise provided in such bond 794
proceedings, such a bond service fund shall be a fund for all 795
such bonds, without distinction or priority of one over another. 796

of a water improvement district under this chapter, whether as 798

paid shall act as trustee of such money and hold and apply it 808
for the purposes thereof, subject to applicable provisions of 809
this chapter and the bond proceedings. 810

state, for the increase of their commerce and prosperity, and 824
for the improvement of their health and living conditions, and 825

water improvement district constitute the performance of 827
essential governmental functions, the district shall not be 828
required to pay any state or local taxes or assessments upon any 829
project, or upon revenues or any property acquired or used by 830
the district under this chapter, or upon the income therefrom. 831
The bonds issued under this chapter, their transfer, and the 832
income therefrom, including any profit made on the sale thereof, 833
shall at all times be free from taxation within the state. 834

district to undertake a project that is located wholly or 838
partially within that county provided that the board of county 839
commissioners of the county that created the water improvement 840
district also must enter into the agreement. 841
No water improvement district shall undertake a project 842
that is located wholly or partially within a county that did not 843
create the water improvement district except pursuant to an 844
agreement entered into in accordance with this section, a 845
project being undertaken by two or more water improvement 846

water management facility located in the county in which the 854
appeals board is located, including an action regarding any 855
water project facilitated, coordinated, funded, financed, 856
constructed, reconstructed, or repaired under this chapter in 857
that county. 858

the most populous township in the county's unincorporated area. 871
(5) One member appointed by the county engineer who 872

Sec. 6120.031. (A) As used in this section, "public 343
improvement" means the construction, reconstruction, or repair 344
of any waste water or water management facility. 345
(B) The board of trustees of a water improvement district 346
may provide for a public improvement and levy special 347
assessments, if the board determines that the public improvement 348
will benefit the area where it will be constructed, 349
reconstructed, or repaired. However, if the improvement is 350
proposed for territory in a political subdivision located 351
outside the district's territory, the legislative authority of 352
that political subdivision shall approve the undertaking of the 353
improvement within the political subdivision. 354
(C) If any improvements are made under this section, 355
contracts for the improvement may provide that the improvement 356
may be owned by the district or by the person or corporation 357
supplying it to the district under a lease. 358

improvement described in division (B) of this section, the board 360
shall conduct a hearing on the proposed improvement. The board 361

improvement will be made and the area that will benefit from the 363
improvement. 364

the proposed improvement. The secretary-treasurer of the board 366
shall deliver, to each owner of a parcel of land or a lot that 367

H. B. No. 49 Page 14
As Introduced
the board identifies as benefiting from the proposed 368
improvement, a notice that sets forth the substance of the 369
proposed improvement and the time and place of the hearing on 370
it. At least fifteen days before the date set for the hearing, a 371
copy of the notice shall be served upon the owner or left at the 372
owner's usual place of residence, or, if the owner is a 373
corporation, upon an officer or agent of the corporation. On or 374
before the day of the hearing, the person serving notice of the 375

notice to each nonresident owner of a lot or parcel of land in 381
the area to be benefited by the improvement, by publication once 382
in a newspaper of general circulation in the one or more 383
counties in which this area is located. The publication of the 384
notice shall be verified by affidavit of the printer or other 385
person having knowledge of the publication and shall be filed 386
with the secretary-treasurer of the district on or before the 387
date of the hearing. 388
(F) At the time and place specified in the notice for a 389
hearing on the proposed improvement, the board of trustees of 390
the district shall meet and hear any and all testimony provided 391
by any of the parties affected by the proposed improvement and 392
by any other persons competent to testify. The board or its 393
representatives shall inspect, by an actual viewing, the area to 394
be benefited by the proposed improvement. The board shall 395
determine the necessity of the proposed improvement and may find 396
that the proposed improvement will result in general as well as 397
special benefits. The board may adjourn from time to time and to 398

H. B. No. 49 Page 15

such places as it considers necessary. 399
(G)(1) The board may award contracts or enter into a lease 400
agreement for the construction, reconstruction, or repair of any 401
improvement described in division (B) of this section and may 402
issue notes, bonds, revenue anticipatory instruments, or other 403
obligations, as authorized by this chapter, to finance the 404
improvements. 405
(2) All or a part of the costs and expenses of providing 406
for the construction, reconstruction, or repair of any 407
improvement described in division (G)(1) of this section may be 408
paid from a fund into which may be paid special assessments 409
levied under this section against the lots and parcels of land 410
in the area to be benefited by the improvement, if the board 411
finds that the improvement will result in general or special 412
benefits to the benefited area. These special assessments shall 413
be levied not more than one time on the same lot or parcel of 414
land. Such costs and expenses may also be paid from the treasury 415
of the district or from other available sources in amounts the 416
board finds appropriate. 417
(3) The board shall levy special assessments at an amount 418
not to exceed ten per cent of the assessable value of the lot or 419
parcel of land being assessed. The board shall determine the 420
assessable value of a lot or parcel of land in the following 421
manner: the board shall first determine the fair market value of 422
the lot or parcel being assessed in the calendar year in which 423
the area to be benefited by the public improvement is first 424
designated and then multiply this amount by the average rate of 425
appreciation in value of the lot or parcel since that calendar 426
year. The assessable value of the lot or parcel is the current 427
fair market value of the lot or parcel minus the amount 428

H. B. No. 49 Page 16
As Introduced
calculated in the manner described in the immediately preceding 429
sentence. The board may adjust the assessable value of a lot or 430
parcel of land to reflect a sale of the lot or parcel that 431
indicates an appreciation in its value that exceeds its average 432
rate of appreciation in value. 433
(4) Special assessments levied by the board may be paid in 434
full in a lump sum or may be paid and collected in equal 435
semiannual installments, equal in number to twice the number of 436
years for which the lease of the improvement is made or twice 437
the number of years that the note, bond, instrument, or 438
obligation that the assessments are pledged to pay requires. The 439
assessments shall be paid and collected in the same manner and 440
at the same time as real property taxes are paid and collected, 441
and assessments in the amount of fifty dollars or less shall be 442
paid in full, and not in installments, at the time the first or 443
next installment would otherwise become due and payable. 444
Complaints regarding assessments may be made to the county board 445
of revision in the same manner as complaints relating to the 446
valuation and assessment of real property. 447
Credits against assessments shall be granted equal to the 448
value of any construction, reconstruction, or repair that an 449
owner of a parcel of land or lot makes to an improvement 450
pursuant to an agreement between the owner and the district. 451
(5) After the levy of a special assessment, the board, at 452
any time during any year in which an installment of the 453
assessment becomes due, may pay out of other available funds of 454
the district, including any state or federal funds available to 455
the district, the full amount of the price of the contract that 456
the special assessments are pledged to pay for that year or any 457
other portion of the remaining obligation. The board shall be 458

H. B. No. 49 Page 17

the sole determiner of the definition, extent, and allocation of 459
the benefit resulting from an improvement that the board 460
authorizes under this section. 461
(H)(1) The board shall certify to the appropriate county 462
auditor the boundaries of the area that is benefited by any 463
public improvement the board authorizes under this section and, 464
when the board so requests, the auditor shall apportion the 465
valuation of any lot or parcel of land lying partly within and 466
partly outside the area so benefited. 467
(2) The board by resolution shall assess against the lots 468
and parcels of land located in the area that is benefited by a 469
public improvement such portion of the costs of completing the 470
public improvement as the board determines, for the period that 471
may be necessary to pay the note, bond, instrument, or 472
obligation issued to pay for the improvement and the proceedings 473
in relation to it, and shall certify these costs to the 474
appropriate county auditor. 475
(3) Except for assessments that have been paid in full in 476
a lump sum, the county auditor shall annually place upon the tax 477
duplicate, for collection in semiannual installments, the two 478
installments of the assessment for that year, which shall be 479
paid and collected at the same time and in the same manner as 480
real property taxes. The collected assessments shall be paid to 481
the treasury of the district and the board of the district shall 482
use the assessments for any purpose authorized by this chapter. 483
Sec. 6120.032. Any water project shall be determined by 484
the board of trustees of the water improvement district to be 485

management approved by the director of natural resources or in 487
the process of preparation by the director and to be not 488

affected thereby by the environmental protection agency. Any 490

shall include a finding by the board of trustees of the district 493
that those determinations have been made. 494

comply with sections 4115.03 to 4115.21 of the Revised Code. 506
Sec. 6120.04. (A) A water improvement district may acquir e 507

purchase, appropriation, or otherwise and in such manner and for 509
such consideration as it considers proper, any public or private 510

respect to bonds, to secure payments to be paid by the district 514
under such a lease, lease-purchase agreement, or lease with 515
option to purchase. Title to real and personal property shall be 516
held in the name of the district. In any proceedings for 517

163.22 of the Revised Code. Except as otherwise agreed to by the 520
owner, full compensation shall be paid for public property so 521
taken. 522
(B) This section does not authorize a district to take or 523
disturb property or facilities belonging to any public utility 524
or to a common carrier engaged in interstate commerce, which 525
property or facilities are required for the proper and 526
convenient operation of the public utility or common carrier, 527
unless provision is made for the restoration, relocation, 528

manner and for such consideration as determined by the district 534
if to a governmental agency. Disposition of personal property 535
shall be in such manner and for such consideration as determined 536

manner and under such restrictions as the board provides in the 595
bond proceedings. 596

and the rights, duties, and obligations of the board in respect 714
to such bonds shall be governed by the provisions of this 715
chapter insofar as they are applicable and by the applicable 716
bond proceedings. 717
Sec. 6120.08. This chapter provides an additional and 718
alternative method for financing, constructing, reconstructing, 719
or repairing projects and taking the actions authorized by this 720

reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All 765
expenses incurred in entering into or carrying out the 766

proceedings authorizing the issuance of those outstanding bonds, 776
and otherwise as provided by the board of trustees of the 777
district, and the balance of the pledged revenues shall be set 778
aside, at such regular intervals as are provided in the bond 779
proceedings in a bond service fund which is hereby pledged to 780

such outstanding bonds as provided in the applicable bond 782
proceedings. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the 783

thereafter received by the board shall immediately be subject to 785
the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or 786
further act, and the lien of such pledge shall be valid and 787

such parties have notice thereof. The bond proceedings by which 790
a pledge is created need not be filed or recorded except in the 791
records of the board. The use and disposition of money to the 792
credit of a bond service fund shall be subject to the applicable 793
bond proceedings. Except as is otherwise provided in such bond 794
proceedings, such a bond service fund shall be a fund for all 795
such bonds, without distinction or priority of one over another. 796
Sec. 6120.12. All money received by the board of trustees 797
of a water improvement district under this chapter, whether as 798
proceeds from the sale of bonds, as revenues, or otherwise, are 799

any applicable bond proceedings. Such money shall be kept in 801
depositories as selected by the board in the manner provided in 802
sections 135.01 to 135.21 of the Revised Code, insofar as such 803
sections are applicable, and the deposits shall be secured as 804
provided in sections 135.01 to 135.21 of the Revised Code. The 805
bond proceedings shall provide that any officer to whom, or any 806
bank or trust company to which, revenues or pledged revenues are 807
paid shall act as trustee of such money and hold and apply it 808
for the purposes thereof, subject to applicable provisions of 809
this chapter and the bond proceedings. 810
Sec. 6120.13. Any holder of bonds issued and outstanding 811
under this chapter, or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, 812
and the trustee under any trust agreement, except to the extent 813
the rights given by this chapter may be restricted or modified 814
by the bond proceedings, may by suit, action, mandamus, or other 815
proceedings, protect and enforce any rights under the laws of 816
the state or granted under this chapter or the bond proceedings, 817
and may enforce and compel the performance of all duties 818

Sec. 6120.14. The exercise of the powers granted by this 822
chapter is in all respects for the benefit of the people of the 823
state, for the increase of their commerce and prosperity, and 824
for the improvement of their health and living conditions, and 825
as the construction, reconstruction, and repair of projects by a 826
water improvement district constitute the performance of 827
essential governmental functions, the district shall not be 828
required to pay any state or local taxes or assessments upon any 829
project, or upon revenues or any property acquired or used by 830
the district under this chapter, or upon the income therefrom. 831

income therefrom, including any profit made on the sale thereof, 833
shall at all times be free from taxation within the state. 834

into an agreement with a contiguous water improvement district 836
that the board of county commissioners did not create for the 837
district to undertake a project that is located wholly or 838
partially within that county provided that the board of county 839
commissioners of the county that created the water improvement 840
district also must enter into the agreement. 841
No water improvement district shall undertake a project 842
that is located wholly or partially within a county that did not 843

agreement entered into in accordance with this section, a 845
project being undertaken by two or more water improvement 846
districts, or as otherwise provided by law. 847

commissioners. The appeals board has exclusive original 852
jurisdiction over any action regarding a waste water facility or 853
water management facility located in the county in which the 854
appeals board is located, including an action regarding any 855
water project facilitated, coordinated, funded, financed, 856
constructed, reconstructed, or repaired under this chapter in 857
that county. 858
