petitioner in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure. The 2114
hearing shall occur not sooner than fourteen days and not later 2115
than thirty days after the date the petitioner is served with 2116
the request. 2117
(2) The respondent shall have the burden of proving by a 2118
preponderance of the evidence that the respondent does not pose 2119
a significant danger of causing personal injury to self or 2120
others by having custody or control of a firearm or the ability 2121
to purchase, possess, or receive a firearm. The court may 2122
consider any relevant evidence, including evidence of the 2123
considerations listed in division (N)(1) of section 2923.26 of 2124
the Revised Code. 2125
(3) If the court finds after the hearing that the 2126

terminate the order. 2128
H. B. No. 46 Page 73

(B) The court shall notify the petitioner of the impending 2129
expiration of an extreme risk protection order. Notice shall be 2130
received by the petitioner sixty calendar days before the date 2131

enforcement officer or agency may by motion request a renewal of 2134
an extreme risk protection not sooner than sixty calendar days 2135
before the expiration of the order. 2136
(D) Upon receipt of a motion to renew, the court shall 2137
order that a hearing be held not later than fourteen days from 2138
the date of the request for renewal. The court may schedule a 2139
hearing by telephone in the manner prescribed by division (J)(1) 2140
of section 2923.26 of the Revised Code. The respondent shall be 2141
personally served in the same manner prescribed by divisions (I) 2142
(3) and (L) of section 2923.26 of the Revised Code. 2143
(E) In determining whether to renew an extreme risk 2144
protection order under this section, the court shall consider 2145
all relevant evidence presented by the petitioner and follow the 2146
same procedure as provided in section 2923.26 of the Revised 2147
Code. 2148
If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that 2149
the requirements for issuance of an extreme risk protection 2150
order as provided in section 2923.26 of the Revised Code 2151
continue to be met, the court shall renew the order. However, 2152
if, after notice, the motion for renewal is uncontested and the 2153
petitioner seeks no modification of the order, the order may be 2154
renewed on the basis of the petitioner's motion or affidavit 2155
stating that there has been no material change in relevant 2156
circumstances since entry of the order and stating the reason 2157
for the requested renewal. 2158

order the respondent to surrender to the local law enforcement 2166
agency all firearms in the respondent's custody, control, or 2167

to the respondent under section 2923.125 or 2923.1213 of the 2169
Revised Code. 2170
(B) The law enforcement officer serving any extreme risk 2171
protection order or ex parte extreme risk protection order 2172
issued under sections 2923.26 to 2923.30 of the Revised Code 2173
shall request that the respondent immediately surrender all 2174
firearms in the respondent's custody, control, or possession and 2175
any license to carry a concealed handgun issued to the 2176
respondent under section 2923.125 or 2923.1213 of the Revised 2177
Code, and conduct any search permitted by law for such firearms. 2178
(C) The law enforcement officer shall take possession of 2179
all firearms belonging to the respondent that are surrendered, 2180
in plain sight, or discovered pursuant to a lawful search. 2181
Alternatively, if personal service by a law enforcement officer 2182
is not possible, or not required because the respondent was 2183
present at the extreme risk protection order hearing, the 2184
respondent shall surrender the firearms in a safe manner to the 2185
control of the local law enforcement agency within forty-eight 2186
hours of being served with the order by alternate service or 2187
within forty-eight hours of the hearing at which the respondent 2188

(D) At the time of surrender, a law enforcement officer 2190
taking possession of a firearm or concealed handgun license 2191
shall issue a receipt identifying all firearms that have been 2192
surrendered and provide a copy of the receipt to the respondent. 2193
Within seventy-two hours after service of the order, the officer 2194
serving the order shall file the original receipt with the court 2195
and shall ensure that the officer's law enforcement agency 2196
retains a copy of the receipt. 2197
(E) Upon the sworn statement or testimony of the 2198
petitioner or of any law enforcement officer alleging that the 2199
respondent has failed to comply with the surrender of firearms 2200
as required by an order issued under sections 2923.26 to 2923.30 2201
of the Revised Code, the court shall determine whether probable 2202
cause exists to believe that the respondent has failed to 2203
surrender all firearms in the respondent's possession, custody, 2204
or control. If probable cause exists, the court shall issue a 2205
warrant describing the firearms and authorizing a search of the 2206
locations where the firearms are reasonably believed to be and 2207
the seizure of any firearms discovered pursuant to such search. 2208
(F) If a person other than the respondent claims title to 2209
any firearm surrendered pursuant to this section, and the other 2210
person is determined by the law enforcement agency to be the 2211
lawful owner of the firearm, the firearm shall be returned to 2212
the other person, provided that both of the following apply: 2213
(1) The firearm is removed from the respondent's custody, 2214
control, or possession and the lawful owner agrees to store the 2215
firearm in a manner such that the respondent does not have 2216
access to or control of the firearm. 2217

respondent to appear not later than three judicial days from the 2222
issuance of the order. The court shall require a showing that 2223
the respondent has surrendered any firearms in the respondent's 2224
custody, control, or possession. The court may dismiss the 2225
hearing upon a satisfactory showing that the respondent is in 2226
compliance with the order. 2227
(H) All law enforcement agencies shall develop policies 2228
and procedures not later than six months after the effective 2229
date of this section regarding the acceptance, storage, and 2230
return of firearms required to be surrendered under sections 2231

Section 99:
2923.26 to 2923.30 of the Revised Code. 2232
(I) If an extreme risk protection order is terminated or 2233
expires without renewal or an ex parte extreme risk protection 2234
order expires and an extreme risk protection order is not issued 2235
regarding the respondent, a law enforcement agency holding any 2236
firearm that has been surrendered pursuant to sections 2923.26 2237
to 2923.30 of the Revised Code shall return any surrendered 2238
firearm requested by a respondent only after confirming, through 2239
a background check, that the respondent is currently eligible to 2240
own or possess firearms under federal and state law and after 2241
confirming with the court that the extreme risk protection order 2242
has terminated or has expired without renewal. 2243
(J) A law enforcement agency shall, if requested by a 2244
family or household member of a respondent, provide prior notice 2245

Sec. 2923.29. (A) The respondent may submit one written 2105

than thirty days after the date the petitioner is served with 2116
the request. 2117
(2) The respondent shall have the burden of proving by a 2118
preponderance of the evidence that the respondent does not pose 2119
a significant danger of causing personal injury to self or 2120
others by having custody or control of a firearm or the ability 2121
to purchase, possess, or receive a firearm. The court may 2122
consider any relevant evidence, including evidence of the 2123
considerations listed in division (N)(1) of section 2923.26 of 2124
the Revised Code. 2125
(3) If the court finds after the hearing that the 2126

enforcement officer or agency may by motion request a renewal of 2134

before the expiration of the order. 2136
(D) Upon receipt of a motion to renew, the court shall 2137

the date of the request for renewal. The court may schedule a 2139
hearing by telephone in the manner prescribed by division (J)(1) 2140
of section 2923.26 of the Revised Code. The respondent shall be 2141
personally served in the same manner prescribed by divisions (I) 2142
(3) and (L) of section 2923.26 of the Revised Code. 2143

Code. 2148
If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that 2149
the requirements for issuance of an extreme risk protection 2150
order as provided in section 2923.26 of the Revised Code 2151
continue to be met, the court shall renew the order. However, 2152
if, after notice, the motion for renewal is uncontested and the 2153
petitioner seeks no modification of the order, the order may be 2154
renewed on the basis of the petitioner's motion or affidavit 2155
stating that there has been no material change in relevant 2156
circumstances since entry of the order and stating the reason 2157
for the requested renewal. 2158

any license to carry a concealed handgun issued to the 2176
respondent under section 2923.125 or 2923.1213 of the Revised 2177
Code, and conduct any search permitted by law for such firearms. 2178
(C) The law enforcement officer shall take possession of 2179
all firearms belonging to the respondent that are surrendered, 2180
in plain sight, or discovered pursuant to a lawful search. 2181
Alternatively, if personal service by a law enforcement officer 2182
is not possible, or not required because the respondent was 2183
present at the extreme risk protection order hearing, the 2184
respondent shall surrender the firearms in a safe manner to the 2185

taking possession of a firearm or concealed handgun license 2191
shall issue a receipt identifying all firearms that have been 2192
surrendered and provide a copy of the receipt to the respondent. 2193
Within seventy-two hours after service of the order, the officer 2194

respondent has failed to comply with the surrender of firearms 2200
as required by an order issued under sections 2923.26 to 2923.30 2201
of the Revised Code, the court shall determine whether probable 2202
cause exists to believe that the respondent has failed to 2203
surrender all firearms in the respondent's possession, custody, 2204
or control. If probable cause exists, the court shall issue a 2205
warrant describing the firearms and authorizing a search of the 2206
locations where the firearms are reasonably believed to be and 2207
the seizure of any firearms discovered pursuant to such search. 2208
(F) If a person other than the respondent claims title to 2209
any firearm surrendered pursuant to this section, and the other 2210
person is determined by the law enforcement agency to be the 2211
lawful owner of the firearm, the firearm shall be returned to 2212
the other person, provided that both of the following apply: 2213
(1) The firearm is removed from the respondent's custody, 2214
control, or possession and the lawful owner agrees to store the 2215
firearm in a manner such that the respondent does not have 2216

respondent to appear not later than three judicial days from the 2222
issuance of the order. The court shall require a showing that 2223
the respondent has surrendered any firearms in the respondent's 2224
custody, control, or possession. The court may dismiss the 2225
hearing upon a satisfactory showing that the respondent is in 2226
compliance with the order. 2227
(H) All law enforcement agencies shall develop policies 2228
and procedures not later than six months after the effective 2229
date of this section regarding the acceptance, storage, and 2230
return of firearms required to be surrendered under sections 2231
2923.26 to 2923.30 of the Revised Code. 2232
(I) If an extreme risk protection order is terminated or 2233
expires without renewal or an ex parte extreme risk protection 2234
order expires and an extreme risk protection order is not issued 2235
regarding the respondent, a law enforcement agency holding any 2236
firearm that has been surrendered pursuant to sections 2923.26 2237

firearm requested by a respondent only after confirming, through 2239

has terminated or has expired without renewal. 2243
