Sec. 3709.29. If the estimated amount of money necessary 7

time declare by resolution that the amount of taxes which may be 44
raised within the ten-mill limitation by levies on the current 45

for the necessary requirements of the public library, that it is 47
necessary to levy a tax in excess of such limitation for current 48
expenses of the public library or for the construction of any 49
specific permanent improvement or class of improvements which 50
