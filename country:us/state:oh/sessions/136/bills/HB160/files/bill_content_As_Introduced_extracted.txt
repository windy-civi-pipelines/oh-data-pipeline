Section 35:
711.131 of the Revised Code that are contiguous to one another, 314
or some of which are contiguous to one another and adjacent to 315
one side of a dedicated public road, and the balance of which 316

developed with at least one building, structure, or improvement 327
that is subject to real property taxation or that is subject to 328

regulation is necessary to protect public health and safety. 376
Nothing in division (C)(4) of this section confers power 377
on a township zoning commission, board of township trustees, or 378
board of zoning appeals to require any parking area to be 379
improved in any manner, including requirements governing 380

adult-use dispensaries under section 3780.25 of the Revised 3298
Code, as that section existed immediately before its repeal by 3299

and townships receiving funds under this division may use such 3304
funds for any lawful purpose. 3305
