Representative Schmidt
A R E S O L U T I O N
Observing World Sight Day in Ohio, October 9, 2025.
WHEREAS, The members of the House of Representatives of the 136th 1
General Assembly of Ohio are pleased to observe World Sight Day in 2
Ohio, October 9, 2025; and 3
WHEREAS, It is easy to take our senses for granted, but even those 4
with perfect vision are at risk of experiencing vision impairment, 5
including blindness. World Sight Day serves to educate individuals on 6
the fact that more than half of all causes of blindness are 7
preventable, so as to create a country where eye health is understood, 8
accessible, available, and affordable; and 9
WHEREAS, The impact blindness has is impossible to estimate, as it 10
goes beyond simple economic influence but touches all facets of our 11
society, and eye health must instead be viewed as a human development 12
issue, for by creating an Ohio where nearly all can see, more people 13
will be able to succeed and pursue their dreams and passions. Vision 14
disability is one of the most prevalent conditions in our country, and 15
the many fine people who have united behind World Sight Day are to be 16
praised for their advocacy; and 17
WHEREAS, While the causes of blindness are often treatable, the 18
number of Ohioans suffering from conditions that impact vision 19
continues to increase, and it is our sincere hope that World Sight Day 20
will positively impact our state by educating individuals about the 21
risks and treatments. Together, we can work to ensure that more 22
citizens are able to see tomorrow; therefore be it 23
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the House of Representatives of 24
the 136th General Assembly of Ohio, in adopting this Resolution, 25
observe World Sight Day in Ohio, October 9, 2025; and be it further 26
