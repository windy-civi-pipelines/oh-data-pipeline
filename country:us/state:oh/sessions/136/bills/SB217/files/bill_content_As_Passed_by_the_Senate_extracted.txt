leases, agreements, licenses, permits, memoranda of 45
understanding, easements, covenants, conditions, reservations, 46

and restrictions of record, and encroachments whether of record 47

(2) The deed or deeds for the conveyance of the real 53
estate may contain restrictions, exceptions, reservations, 54
reversionary interests, and other terms and conditions the 55
Director of Administrative Services determines to be in the best 56
interest of the State. 57
(3) Subsequent to the conveyance, any restrictions, 58
exceptions, reservations, reversionary interests, or other terms 59
and conditions contained in the deed may be released by the 60
State or the Adjutant General's Department without the necessity 61
of further legislation. 62
(4) The real estate described above shall be conveyed 63
only if the Director of Administrative Services and the Director 64
of the Adjutant General's Department first have determined that 65
the real estate is surplus real property no longer needed by the 66
State and that the conveyance is in the best interest of the 67
State. 68
(C) The Director of Administrative Services shall conduct 69
a sale of the real estate by sealed bid auction or public 70
auction, and the real estate shall be sold to the highest bidder 71
at a price acceptable to the Director of Administrative Services 72
and the Adjutant General's Department. The Department of 73
Administrative Services shall advertise the sealed bid auction 74
or public auction by publication in a newspaper of general 75

Administrative Services may reject any or all bids. 80
The purchaser shall pay ten percent of the purchase price 81

certified check made payable to the Treasurer of State. A 91
purchaser who does not complete the conditions of the sale as 92
prescribed in this division shall forfeit ten percent of the 93
purchase price paid to the State as liquidated damages. If a 94
purchaser fails to complete the purchase, the Director of 95
Administrative Services may accept the next highest bid, subject 96
to the foregoing conditions. If the Director of Administrative 97
Services rejects all bids, the Department of Administrative 98
Services may repeat the sealed bid auction or public auction, or 99
may use an alternative sale process that is acceptable to the 100
Adjutant General's Department. 101
The Adjutant General's Department shall pay advertising 102
and other costs incident to the sale of the real estate. 103
(D) The real estate described in division (A) of this 104

real estate described in division (A) of this section. The 118
Governor's Deed shall state the consideration and shall be 119
executed by the Governor in the name of the State, countersigned 120
by the Secretary of State, sealed with the Great Seal of the 121
State, presented in the Department of Administrative Services 122
for recording, and delivered to the Grantee(s). The Grantee(s) 123
