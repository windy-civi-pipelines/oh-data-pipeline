or that compliance of that nature did not occur but the failure 705
to give a written notice to a party entitled to notice under 706
division (A)(1)(a) of section 2329.26 of the Revised Code has 707
not prejudiced that party; 708
(ii) (b) That all parties entitled to notice under 709
division (A)(1)(a) of section 2329.26 of the Revised Code 710
received adequate notice of the date, time, and place of the 711

said premises, or a part thereof, remain unsold for want of 731
bidders after having been once appraised, advertised, and 732
offered for sale, the court from which the order of sale issued 733
may, on motion of the plaintiff or defendant and from time to 734
time until said premises are disposed of, order a new 735
appraisement and sale or direct the amount for which said 736

Revised Code. 761

one year after having been certified as delinquent, the state 771
shall institute foreclosure proceedings in the manner provided 772
by section 323.25, sections 323.65 to 323.79, or sections 773
5721.01 to 5721.28 of the Revised Code, unless a tax certificate 774
respecting that property has been sold or assigned under section 775
5721.32 or 5721.33 of the Revised Code, or unless such taxes are 776
the subject of a valid delinquent tax contract under section 777
