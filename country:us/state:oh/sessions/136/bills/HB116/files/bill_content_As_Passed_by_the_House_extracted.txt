level pass-through entity for each day during the upper level 2237
pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year in which or with 2238
which ends the lower level pass-through entity's calendar or 2239

any pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward available to the 175
person for the municipal corporation. 176
(b)(i) For an individual who is a resident of a municipal 177
corporation other than a qualified municipal corporation, income 178

taxpayer who is an individual, the taxpayer may subtract, as 206
provided in division (A)(1)(b)(i) or (c) of this section, the 207
amount of the individual's employee business expenses reported 208
on the individual's form 2106 that the individual deducted for 209
federal income tax purposes for the taxable year, subject to the 210
limitation imposed by section 67 of the Internal Revenue Code. 211

operating loss generated in the same taxable year and 231

through entity shall be allowed as a deduction, for that taxable 233
year and the following five taxable years, against any other net 234
profit of the resident or the resident's distributive share of 235
any net profit attributable to the resident's ownership interest 236
in a pass-through entity until fully utilized, subject to 237
division (B)(1)(d) of this section; 238
(ii) The resident's distributive share of the net profit 239
of each pass-through entity owned directly or indirectly by the 240
resident shall be calculated without regard to any net operating 241
loss that is carried forward by that entity from a prior taxable 242
year and applied to reduce the entity's net profit for the 243
current taxable year. 244
(c) Division (B)(1)(b) of this section does not apply with 245
respect to any net profit or net operating loss attributable to 246

limitations, and exclusions set forth therein, and "qualified 1244
long-term care" has the same meaning given in section 7702B(c) 1245
of the Internal Revenue Code. Solely for purposes of division 1246
(A)(10)(a) of this section, "dependent" includes a person who 1247
otherwise would be a "qualifying relative" and thus a 1248
"dependent" under section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code but 1249

reimbursement or refund of expenses that in any year the 1255
taxpayer had deducted as an itemized deduction pursuant to 1256
section 63 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable United 1257
States department of the treasury regulations. The deduction 1258
otherwise allowed under division (A)(11)(a) of this section 1259

gross income for any taxable year to the extent that the amount 1264
is attributable to the recovery during the taxable year of any 1265
amount deducted or excluded in computing federal or Ohio 1266
adjusted gross income in any taxable year. 1267
(12) Deduct any portion of the deduction described in 1268

(a) It is allowable for repayment of an item that was 1272
included in the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for a prior 1273
taxable year and did not qualify for a credit under division (A) 1274
or (B) of section 5747.05 of the Revised Code for that year; 1275
(b) It does not otherwise reduce the taxpayer's adjusted 1276
gross income for the current or any other taxable year. 1277
(13) Deduct an amount equal to the deposits made to, and 1278
net investment earnings of, a medical savings account during the 1279

otherwise deducted or excluded for the current or any other 1283
taxable year from the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income. 1284
(14)(a) Add an amount equal to the funds withdrawn from a 1285
medical savings account during the taxable year, and the net 1286
investment earnings on those funds, when the funds withdrawn 1287
were used for any purpose other than to reimburse an account 1288
holder for, or to pay, eligible medical expenses, in accordance 1289
with section 3924.66 of the Revised Code; 1290
(b) Add the amounts distributed from a medical savings 1291
account under division (A)(2) of section 3924.68 of the Revised 1292
Code during the taxable year. 1293
(15) Add any amount claimed as a credit under section 1294
5747.059 of the Revised Code to the extent that such amount 1295

computation of the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income as 1298

the Internal Revenue Code; 1300

federal adjusted gross income as required to be reported for any 1302
of the taxpayer's taxable years under the Internal Revenue Code. 1303
(16) Deduct the amount contributed by the taxpayer to an 1304
individual development account program established by a county 1305
department of job and family services pursuant to sections 1306
329.11 to 329.14 of the Revised Code for the purpose of matching 1307

commissioner, the taxpayer shall provide any information that, 1309
in the tax commissioner's opinion, is necessary to establish the 1310
amount deducted under division (A)(16) of this section. 1311

ownership interest. 1319

allowed to the taxpayer by subsection (k) of section 168 of the 1342
Internal Revenue Code, and including the taxpayer's 1343

any such pass-through entities. 1345
(v) If a taxpayer directly or indirectly incurs a net 1346
operating loss for the taxable year for federal income tax 1347

Revenue Code and by qualifying section 179 depreciation expense, 1350
"the entire" shall be substituted for "five-sixths of the" for 1351
