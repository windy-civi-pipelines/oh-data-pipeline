of equity or ownership interests in, or debt obligations of, a 2123
qualifying investee to the extent included in the trust's Ohio 2124
taxable income, but only if the following requirements are 2125
satisfied: 2126
(a) The book value of the qualifying investee's physical 2127
assets in this state and everywhere, as of the last day of the 2128
qualifying investee's fiscal or calendar year ending immediately 2129
prior to the date on which the trust recognizes the gain or 2130
loss, is available to the trust. 2131
(b) The requirements of section 5747.011 of the Revised 2132
Code are satisfied for the trust's taxable year in which the 2133
trust recognizes the gain or loss. 2134
Any gain or loss that is not a qualifying trust amount is 2135
modified business income, qualifying investment income, or 2136
modified nonbusiness income, as the case may be. 2137
(3) "Modified nonbusiness income" means a trust's Ohio 2138
taxable income other than modified business income, other than 2139
the qualifying trust amount, and other than qualifying 2140
investment income, as defined in section 5747.012 of the Revised 2141
Code, to the extent such qualifying investment income is not 2142

H. B. No. 116 Page 75

otherwise part of modified business income. 2143
(4) "Modified Ohio taxable income" applies only to trusts, 2144
and means the sum of the amounts described in divisions (AA)(4) 2145
(a) to (c) of this section: 2146
(a) The fraction, calculated under section 5747.013, and 2147
applying section 5747.231 of the Revised Code, multiplied by the 2148
sum of the following amounts: 2149
(i) The trust's modified business income; 2150
(ii) The trust's qualifying investment income, as defined 2151
in section 5747.012 of the Revised Code, but only to the extent 2152
the qualifying investment income does not otherwise constitute 2153
modified business income and does not otherwise constitute a 2154
qualifying trust amount. 2155
(b) The qualifying trust amount multiplied by a fraction, 2156
the numerator of which is the sum of the book value of the 2157
qualifying investee's physical assets in this state on the last 2158
day of the qualifying investee's fiscal or calendar year ending 2159
immediately prior to the day on which the trust recognizes the 2160
qualifying trust amount, and the denominator of which is the sum 2161
of the book value of the qualifying investee's total physical 2162
assets everywhere on the last day of the qualifying investee's 2163
fiscal or calendar year ending immediately prior to the day on 2164
which the trust recognizes the qualifying trust amount. If, for 2165
a taxable year, the trust recognizes a qualifying trust amount 2166
with respect to more than one qualifying investee, the amount 2167
described in division (AA)(4)(b) of this section shall equal the 2168
sum of the products so computed for each such qualifying 2169
investee. 2170
(c)(i) With respect to a trust or portion of a trust that 2171

H. B. No. 116 Page 76

is a resident as ascertained in accordance with division (I)(3) 2172
(d) of this section, its modified nonbusiness income. 2173
(ii) With respect to a trust or portion of a trust that is 2174
not a resident as ascertained in accordance with division (I)(3) 2175
(d) of this section, the amount of its modified nonbusiness 2176
income satisfying the descriptions in divisions (B)(2) to (5) of 2177
section 5747.20 of the Revised Code, except as otherwise 2178
provided in division (AA)(4)(c)(ii) of this section. With 2179
respect to a trust or portion of a trust that is not a resident 2180
as ascertained in accordance with division (I)(3)(d) of this 2181
section, the trust's portion of modified nonbusiness income 2182
recognized from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of a 2183
debt interest in or equity interest in a section 5747.212 2184
entity, as defined in section 5747.212 of the Revised Code, 2185
without regard to division (A) of that section, shall not be 2186
allocated to this state in accordance with section 5747.20 of 2187
the Revised Code but shall be apportioned to this state in 2188
accordance with division (B) of section 5747.212 of the Revised 2189
Code without regard to division (A) of that section. 2190
If the allocation and apportionment of a trust's income 2191
under divisions (AA)(4)(a) and (c) of this section do not fairly 2192
represent the modified Ohio taxable income of the trust in this 2193
state, the alternative methods described in division (C) of 2194
section 5747.21 of the Revised Code may be applied in the manner 2195
and to the same extent provided in that section. 2196
(5)(a) Except as set forth in division (AA)(5)(b) of this 2197
section, "qualifying investee" means a person in which a trust 2198
has an equity or ownership interest, or a person or unit of 2199
government the debt obligations of either of which are owned by 2200
a trust. For the purposes of division (AA)(2)(a) of this section 2201

and for the purpose of computing the fraction described in 2202
division (AA)(4)(b) of this section, all of the following apply: 2203
(i) If the qualifying investee is a member of a qualifying 2204
controlled group on the last day of the qualifying investee's 2205
fiscal or calendar year ending immediately prior to the date on 2206
which the trust recognizes the gain or loss, then "qualifying 2207
investee" includes all persons in the qualifying controlled 2208
group on such last day. 2209
(ii) If the qualifying investee, or if the qualifying 2210
investee and any members of the qualifying controlled group of 2211
which the qualifying investee is a member on the last day of the 2212
qualifying investee's fiscal or calendar year ending immediately 2213
prior to the date on which the trust recognizes the gain or 2214
loss, separately or cumulatively own, directly or indirectly, on 2215
the last day of the qualifying investee's fiscal or calendar 2216
year ending immediately prior to the date on which the trust 2217
recognizes the qualifying trust amount, more than fifty per cent 2218
of the equity of a pass-through entity, then the qualifying 2219
investee and the other members are deemed to own the 2220
proportionate share of the pass-through entity's physical assets 2221
which the pass-through entity directly or indirectly owns on the 2222
last day of the pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year 2223
ending within or with the last day of the qualifying investee's 2224
fiscal or calendar year ending immediately prior to the date on 2225
which the trust recognizes the qualifying trust amount. 2226
(iii) For the purposes of division (AA)(5)(a)(iii) of this 2227
section, "upper level pass-through entity" means a pass-through 2228
entity directly or indirectly owning any equity of another pass- 2229
through entity, and "lower level pass-through entity" means that 2230
other pass-through entity. 2231

H. B. No. 116 Page 78
As Introduced
An upper level pass-through entity, whether or not it is 2232
also a qualifying investee, is deemed to own, on the last day of 2233
the upper level pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year, 2234
the proportionate share of the lower level pass-through entity's 2235
physical assets that the lower level pass-through entity 2236
directly or indirectly owns on the last day of the lower level 2237
pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year ending within or 2238
with the last day of the upper level pass-through entity's 2239
fiscal or calendar year. If the upper level pass-through entity 2240
directly and indirectly owns less than fifty per cent of the 2241
equity of the lower level pass-through entity on each day of the 2242
upper level pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year in 2243
which or with which ends the calendar or fiscal year of the 2244
lower level pass-through entity and if, based upon clear and 2245
convincing evidence, complete information about the location and 2246
cost of the physical assets of the lower pass-through entity is 2247
not available to the upper level pass-through entity, then 2248
solely for purposes of ascertaining if a gain or loss 2249
constitutes a qualifying trust amount, the upper level pass- 2250
through entity shall be deemed as owning no equity of the lower 2251
level pass-through entity for each day during the upper level 2252
pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year in which or with 2253
which ends the lower level pass-through entity's calendar or 2254
fiscal year. Nothing in division (AA)(5)(a)(iii) of this section 2255
shall be construed to provide for any deduction or exclusion in 2256
computing any trust's Ohio taxable income. 2257
(b) With respect to a trust that is not a resident for the 2258
taxable year and with respect to a part of a trust that is not a 2259
resident for the taxable year, "qualifying investee" for that 2260
taxable year does not include a C corporation if both of the 2261
following apply: 2262
