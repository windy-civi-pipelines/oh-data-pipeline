As Introduced
(A)(1) The tax shall be collected as provided in section 19

Section 3:
5739.025 of the Revised Code. The rate of the tax shall be five 20
and three-fourths per cent. The tax applies and is collectible 21
when the sale is made, regardless of the time when the price is 22
paid or delivered. 23
(2) In the case of the lease or rental, with a fixed term 24
of more than thirty days or an indefinite term with a minimum 25
period of more than thirty days, of any motor vehicles designed 26
by the manufacturer to carry a load of not more than one ton, 27
watercraft, outboard motor, or aircraft, or of any tangible 28
personal property, other than motor vehicles designed by the 29
manufacturer to carry a load of more than one ton, to be used by 30
the lessee or renter primarily for business purposes, the tax 31
shall be collected by the vendor at the time the lease or rental 32
is consummated and shall be calculated by the vendor on the 33
basis of the total amount to be paid by the lessee or renter 34
under the lease agreement. If the total amount of the 35
consideration for the lease or rental includes amounts that are 36
not calculated at the time the lease or rental is executed, the 37
tax shall be calculated and collected by the vendor at the time 38
such amounts are billed to the lessee or renter. In the case of 39
an open-end lease or rental, the tax shall be calculated by the 40
vendor on the basis of the total amount to be paid during the 41
initial fixed term of the lease or rental, and for each 42

evidence, that the transaction or series of transactions is not 54
a sham transaction. 55
(3) Except as provided in division (A)(2) of this section, 56
in the case of a sale, the price of which consists in whole or 57
in part of the lease or rental of tangible personal property, 58

rental. 60
(4) In the case of a sale of a physical fitness facility 61
service or recreation and sports club service, the price of 62

As Introduced
136th General Assembly
Regular Session H. B. No. 87
2025-2026
Representatives Click, Klopfenstein
Cosponsors: Representatives Deeter, Robb Blasdel, Teska, King, Lear, Claggett,
Dean, John, Thomas, D., Gross, Williams
A BILL
To amend sections 5739.02, 5747.01, and 5747.025 of 1
the Revised Code to authorize tax incentives for 2
conceived children and certain child care items 3
and to name this act the Strategic Tax 4
Opportunities for Raising Kids (STORK) Act. 5
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF OHIO:
Section 1. That sections 5739.02, 5747.01, and 5747.025 of 6
the Revised Code be amended to read as follows: 7
Sec. 5739.02. For the purpose of providing revenue with 8
which to meet the needs of the state, for the use of the general 9
revenue fund of the state, for the purpose of securing a 10
thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the 11
state, for the purpose of affording revenues, in addition to 12
those from general property taxes, permitted under 13
constitutional limitations, and from other sources, for the 14
support of local governmental functions, and for the purpose of 15
reimbursing the state for the expense of administering this 16
chapter, an excise tax is hereby levied on each retail sale made 17
in this state. 18

H. B. No. 87 Page 2
As Introduced
(A)(1) The tax shall be collected as provided in section 19
5739.025 of the Revised Code. The rate of the tax shall be five 20
and three-fourths per cent. The tax applies and is collectible 21
when the sale is made, regardless of the time when the price is 22
paid or delivered. 23
(2) In the case of the lease or rental, with a fixed term 24
of more than thirty days or an indefinite term with a minimum 25
period of more than thirty days, of any motor vehicles designed 26
by the manufacturer to carry a load of not more than one ton, 27
watercraft, outboard motor, or aircraft, or of any tangible 28
personal property, other than motor vehicles designed by the 29
manufacturer to carry a load of more than one ton, to be used by 30
the lessee or renter primarily for business purposes, the tax 31
shall be collected by the vendor at the time the lease or rental 32
is consummated and shall be calculated by the vendor on the 33
basis of the total amount to be paid by the lessee or renter 34
under the lease agreement. If the total amount of the 35
consideration for the lease or rental includes amounts that are 36
not calculated at the time the lease or rental is executed, the 37
tax shall be calculated and collected by the vendor at the time 38
such amounts are billed to the lessee or renter. In the case of 39
an open-end lease or rental, the tax shall be calculated by the 40
vendor on the basis of the total amount to be paid during the 41
initial fixed term of the lease or rental, and for each 42
subsequent renewal period as it comes due. As used in this 43
division, "motor vehicle" has the same meaning as in section 44
4501.01 of the Revised Code, and "watercraft" includes an 45
outdrive unit attached to the watercraft. 46
A lease with a renewal clause and a termination penalty or 47
similar provision that applies if the renewal clause is not 48
exercised is presumed to be a sham transaction. In such a case, 49

H. B. No. 87 Page 3
As Introduced
the tax shall be calculated and paid on the basis of the entire 50
length of the lease period, including any renewal periods, until 51
the termination penalty or similar provision no longer applies. 52
The taxpayer shall bear the burden, by a preponderance of the 53
evidence, that the transaction or series of transactions is not 54
a sham transaction. 55
(3) Except as provided in division (A)(2) of this section, 56
in the case of a sale, the price of which consists in whole or 57
in part of the lease or rental of tangible personal property, 58
the tax shall be measured by the installments of that lease or 59
rental. 60
(4) In the case of a sale of a physical fitness facility 61
service or recreation and sports club service, the price of 62
which consists in whole or in part of a membership for the 63
receipt of the benefit of the service, the tax applicable to the 64
sale shall be measured by the installments thereof. 65
(B) The tax does not apply to the following: 66
(1) Sales to the state or any of its political 67
subdivisions, or to any other state or its political 68
subdivisions if the laws of that state exempt from taxation 69
sales made to this state and its political subdivisions 70
including either of the following: 71
(a) Sales or rentals of tangible personal property by 72
construction contractors or subcontractors to provide temporary 73
traffic control or temporary structures, including material and 74
equipment used to comply with the Ohio manual of uniform traffic 75
control devices adopted pursuant to section 4511.09 of the 76
Revised Code, whereby the state or any of its political 77
subdivisions take title to, or permanent or temporary possession 78

H. B. No. 87 Page 4
As Introduced
of, such tangible personal property for use by the state or any 79
of its political subdivisions, including for use by the general 80
public thereof; 81
(b) Sales of services by construction contractors or 82
subcontractors to provide temporary traffic control or 83
structures, including labor used to comply with the Ohio manual 84
of uniform traffic control devices adopted pursuant to section 85
4511.09 of the Revised Code, whereby the state or any of its 86
political subdivisions, including the general public thereof, 87
receive the benefit of such services. 88
As used in divisions (B)(1)(a) and (b) of this section, 89
"temporary structures" include temporary roads, bridges, drains, 90
and pavement. 91
(2) Sales of food for human consumption off the premises 92
where sold; 93
(3) Sales of food sold to students only in a cafeteria, 94
dormitory, fraternity, or sorority maintained in a private, 95
public, or parochial school, college, or university; 96
(4) Sales of newspapers and sales or transfers of 97
magazines distributed as controlled circulation publications; 98
(5) The furnishing, preparing, or serving of meals without 99
charge by an employer to an employee provided the employer 100
records the meals as part compensation for services performed or 101
work done; 102
(6)(a) Sales of motor fuel upon receipt, use, 103
distribution, or sale of which in this state a tax is imposed by 104
the law of this state, but this exemption shall not apply to the 105
sale of motor fuel on which a refund of the tax is allowable 106
under division (A) of section 5735.14 of the Revised Code; and 107

H. B. No. 87 Page 5
As Introduced
the tax commissioner may deduct the amount of tax levied by this 108
section applicable to the price of motor fuel when granting a 109
refund of motor fuel tax pursuant to division (A) of section 110
5735.14 of the Revised Code and shall cause the amount deducted 111
to be paid into the general revenue fund of this state; 112
(b) Sales of motor fuel other than that described in 113
division (B)(6)(a) of this section and used for powering a 114

(7) Sales of natural gas by a natural gas company or 117
municipal gas utility, of water by a water-works company, or of 118

delivered to consumers through pipes or conduits, and all sales 120
of communications services by a telegraph company, all terms as 121
defined in section 5727.01 of the Revised Code, and sales of 122
electricity delivered through wires; 123
(8) Casual sales by a person, or auctioneer employed 124
directly by the person to conduct such sales, except as to such 125
sales of motor vehicles, watercraft or outboard motors required 126
to be titled under section 1548.06 of the Revised Code, 127
watercraft documented with the United States coast guard, 128
snowmobiles, and all-purpose vehicles as defined in section 129
4519.01 of the Revised Code; 130
(9)(a) Sales of services or tangible personal property, 131
other than motor vehicles, mobile homes, and manufactured homes, 132
by churches, organizations exempt from taxation under section 133
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or nonprofit 134
organizations operated exclusively for charitable purposes as 135

and means the sum of the amounts described in divisions (AA)(4) 1870
(a) to (c) of this section: 1871
(a) The fraction, calculated under section 5747.013, and 1872
applying section 5747.231 of the Revised Code, multiplied by the 1873
sum of the following amounts: 1874
(i) The trust's modified business income; 1875
(ii) The trust's qualifying investment income, as defined 1876
in section 5747.012 of the Revised Code, but only to the extent 1877
the qualifying investment income does not otherwise constitute 1878
modified business income and does not otherwise constitute a 1879
qualifying trust amount. 1880
(b) The qualifying trust amount multiplied by a fraction, 1881
the numerator of which is the sum of the book value of the 1882
qualifying investee's physical assets in this state on the last 1883
day of the qualifying investee's fiscal or calendar year ending 1884
immediately prior to the day on which the trust recognizes the 1885
qualifying trust amount, and the denominator of which is the sum 1886

H. B. No. 87 Page 66
As Introduced
of the book value of the qualifying investee's total physical 1887
assets everywhere on the last day of the qualifying investee's 1888
fiscal or calendar year ending immediately prior to the day on 1889
which the trust recognizes the qualifying trust amount. If, for 1890
a taxable year, the trust recognizes a qualifying trust amount 1891
with respect to more than one qualifying investee, the amount 1892
described in division (AA)(4)(b) of this section shall equal the 1893
sum of the products so computed for each such qualifying 1894
investee. 1895
(c)(i) With respect to a trust or portion of a trust that 1896
is a resident as ascertained in accordance with division (I)(3) 1897

not a resident as ascertained in accordance with division (I)(3) 1900

income satisfying the descriptions in divisions (B)(2) to (5) of 1902
section 5747.20 of the Revised Code, except as otherwise 1903
provided in division (AA)(4)(c)(ii) of this section. With 1904
respect to a trust or portion of a trust that is not a resident 1905
as ascertained in accordance with division (I)(3)(d) of this 1906
section, the trust's portion of modified nonbusiness income 1907
recognized from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of a 1908
debt interest in or equity interest in a section 5747.212 1909
entity, as defined in section 5747.212 of the Revised Code, 1910
without regard to division (A) of that section, shall not be 1911
allocated to this state in accordance with section 5747.20 of 1912
the Revised Code but shall be apportioned to this state in 1913
accordance with division (B) of section 5747.212 of the Revised 1914
Code without regard to division (A) of that section. 1915
If the allocation and apportionment of a trust's income 1916

H. B. No. 87 Page 67

under divisions (AA)(4)(a) and (c) of this section do not fairly 1917
represent the modified Ohio taxable income of the trust in this 1918
state, the alternative methods described in division (C) of 1919
section 5747.21 of the Revised Code may be applied in the manner 1920
and to the same extent provided in that section. 1921
(5)(a) Except as set forth in division (AA)(5)(b) of this 1922
section, "qualifying investee" means a person in which a trust 1923
has an equity or ownership interest, or a person or unit of 1924
government the debt obligations of either of which are owned by 1925
a trust. For the purposes of division (AA)(2)(a) of this section 1926
and for the purpose of computing the fraction described in 1927
division (AA)(4)(b) of this section, all of the following apply: 1928
(i) If the qualifying investee is a member of a qualifying 1929
controlled group on the last day of the qualifying investee's 1930
fiscal or calendar year ending immediately prior to the date on 1931
which the trust recognizes the gain or loss, then "qualifying 1932
investee" includes all persons in the qualifying controlled 1933
group on such last day. 1934
(ii) If the qualifying investee, or if the qualifying 1935
investee and any members of the qualifying controlled group of 1936
which the qualifying investee is a member on the last day of the 1937
qualifying investee's fiscal or calendar year ending immediately 1938
prior to the date on which the trust recognizes the gain or 1939
loss, separately or cumulatively own, directly or indirectly, on 1940
the last day of the qualifying investee's fiscal or calendar 1941
year ending immediately prior to the date on which the trust 1942
recognizes the qualifying trust amount, more than fifty per cent 1943
of the equity of a pass-through entity, then the qualifying 1944
investee and the other members are deemed to own the 1945
proportionate share of the pass-through entity's physical assets 1946

H. B. No. 87 Page 68

which the pass-through entity directly or indirectly owns on the 1947
last day of the pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year 1948

fiscal or calendar year ending immediately prior to the date on 1950
which the trust recognizes the qualifying trust amount. 1951
(iii) For the purposes of division (AA)(5)(a)(iii) of this 1952
section, "upper level pass-through entity" means a pass-through 1953
entity directly or indirectly owning any equity of another pass- 1954
through entity, and "lower level pass-through entity" means that 1955
other pass-through entity. 1956
An upper level pass-through entity, whether or not it is 1957
also a qualifying investee, is deemed to own, on the last day of 1958
the upper level pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year, 1959
the proportionate share of the lower level pass-through entity's 1960
physical assets that the lower level pass-through entity 1961
directly or indirectly owns on the last day of the lower level 1962
pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year ending within or 1963
with the last day of the upper level pass-through entity's 1964
fiscal or calendar year. If the upper level pass-through entity 1965
directly and indirectly owns less than fifty per cent of the 1966
equity of the lower level pass-through entity on each day of the 1967
upper level pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year in 1968
which or with which ends the calendar or fiscal year of the 1969
lower level pass-through entity and if, based upon clear and 1970
convincing evidence, complete information about the location and 1971
cost of the physical assets of the lower pass-through entity is 1972
not available to the upper level pass-through entity, then 1973
solely for purposes of ascertaining if a gain or loss 1974
constitutes a qualifying trust amount, the upper level pass- 1975
through entity shall be deemed as owning no equity of the lower 1976
level pass-through entity for each day during the upper level 1977

H. B. No. 87 Page 69
As Introduced
pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year in which or with 1978
which ends the lower level pass-through entity's calendar or 1979
fiscal year. Nothing in division (AA)(5)(a)(iii) of this section 1980
shall be construed to provide for any deduction or exclusion in 1981
computing any trust's Ohio taxable income. 1982
(b) With respect to a trust that is not a resident for the 1983
taxable year and with respect to a part of a trust that is not a 1984
resident for the taxable year, "qualifying investee" for that 1985
taxable year does not include a C corporation if both of the 1986
following apply: 1987
(i) During the taxable year the trust or part of the trust 1988
recognizes a gain or loss from the sale, exchange, or other 1989
disposition of equity or ownership interests in, or debt 1990
obligations of, the C corporation. 1991
(ii) Such gain or loss constitutes nonbusiness income. 1992

related interests, five per cent or more of the ownership or 2031
equity interests. The trustee shall notify the tax commissioner 2032

preceding year, and make a new adjustment to the personal 2106
exemption amount for taxable years beginning in the current 2107
calendar year by multiplying that amount by the percentage 2108
increase in the gross domestic product deflator for that period; 2109
adding the resulting product to the personal exemption amount 2110
for taxable years beginning in the preceding calendar year; and 2111
rounding the resulting sum upward to the nearest multiple of 2112
fifty dollars. The adjusted amount applies to taxable years 2113
beginning in the calendar year in which the adjustment is made 2114

Revised Code applies on and after January 1, 2026. 2131
Section 4. This act shall be known as the Strategic Tax 2132
Opportunities for Raising Kids (STORK) Act. 2133
Section 5. Section 5747.01 of the Revised Code is 2134
presented in this act as a composite of the section as amended 2135
by both H.B. 101 and S.B. 154 of the 135th General Assembly. The 2136
General Assembly, applying the principle stated in division (B) 2137
of section 1.52 of the Revised Code that amendments are to be 2138
harmonized if reasonably capable of simultaneous operation, 2139
finds that the composite is the resulting version of the section 2140
in effect prior to the effective date of the section as 2141
presented in this act. 2142
