of title would bring in the open market and under the then 276

until the assessment is paid or until it is certified to the 1161
attorney general for collection under section 131.02 of the 1162
Revised Code, whichever comes first. If the unpaid portion of 1163
the assessment is certified to the attorney general for 1164
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall 1165
bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 1166

board of county commissioners of the county has levied a real 254

322. of the Revised Code, the amount required by the real 256
property or manufactured home transfer tax so levied. If the 257
conveyance is exempt from the fee provided for in division (G) 258

sold under a land installment contract is conveyed by the seller 267
under such contract to a third party and the contract has been 268
of record at least twelve months prior to the date of 269
conveyance, "value" means the unpaid balance owed to the seller 270
under the contract at the time of the conveyance, but the 271

prior to the date of conveyance. In the case of a gift in whole 273
or part, "value" means the estimated price the real estate or 274
manufactured or mobile home described in the deed or certificate 275
of title would bring in the open market and under the then 276
existing and prevailing market conditions in a sale between a 277
willing seller and a willing buyer, both conversant with the 278
property and with prevailing general price levels. No person 279
shall willfully falsify the value of property conveyed. 280

to indicate the amount of the conveyance fee and compliance with 282

the tax return electronically. The commissioner may require 1000
taxpayers to use the Ohio business gateway as defined in section 1001
718.01 of the Revised Code to file returns and remit the tax, or 1002
may provide another means for taxpayers to file and remit the 1003
tax electronically. 1004
(B) A person required by this section to remit taxes or 1005
file returns electronically may apply to the commissioner, on a 1006
form prescribed by the commissioner, to be excused from that 1007
requirement. The commissioner may excuse a person from that 1008
requirement for good cause. 1009
(C)(1) The housing market impact tax revenue fund is 1010

Sec. 5755.04. (A)(1) A taxpayer who fails to file a retur n 1027
or pay the full amount of the tax due within the period 1028
prescribed under this chapter shall pay a penalty in an amount 1029
not exceeding the product of: 1030
(a) Five per cent of the median Ohio home price as listed 1031
in the American community survey published by the United States 1032
census bureau applicable to the last year for which such data is 1033
published; 1034
(b) The number of taxable houses owned by the taxpayer on 1035
the first day of the tax period to which the return applies. 1036
(2) The penalty imposed under division (A)(1) of this 1037
section is in addition to any other penalty imposed under this 1038
chapter. A penalty may be collected by assessment in the manner 1039
prescribed by section 5755.06 of the Revised Code. The tax 1040
commissioner may abate all or a portion of such a penalty. 1041
(B) If the tax due under section 5755.02 of the Revised 1042
Code is not timely paid, the taxpayer shall pay interest at the 1043
rate per annum prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Revised Code 1044
beginning on the day the tax was due through the day the tax is 1045
paid or an assessment is issued, whichever occurs first. 1046
(C) The tax commissioner shall collect any penalty or 1047
interest as if it were the tax levied by section 5755.02 of the 1048
Revised Code. Penalties and interest shall be credited as if it 1049
was revenue arising from the applicable tax. 1050

Sec. 5755.05. (A) A taxpayer may apply to the tax 1051
commissioner for a refund of any amount imposed under this 1052
chapter that was overpaid, paid illegally or erroneously, or 1053
paid on an illegal or erroneous assessment. The application 1054
shall be on a form prescribed by the tax commissioner. The 1055
taxpayer shall provide the amount of the requested refund along 1056
with the claimed reasons for, and documentation to support, the 1057
issuance of a refund. The taxpayer shall file the application 1058
with the tax commissioner within four years after the date the 1059
payment was made unless the applicant has waived the time 1060
limitation under division (D) of section 5755.06 of the Revised 1061
Code. In the latter event, the four-year limitation is extended 1062
for the same period of time as the waiver. 1063
(B) Upon the filing of a refund application, the tax 1064
commissioner shall determine the amount of refund to which the 1065
applicant is entitled. If the amount is greater than that 1066
claimed, the tax commissioner shall certify the amount to the 1067
director of budget and management and treasurer of state for 1068
payment from the tax refund fund. If the amount is less than 1069
that claimed, the tax commissioner shall proceed under section 1070
5703.70 of the Revised Code. 1071
(C) Interest on a refund applied for under this section, 1072
computed at the rate provided for in section 5703.47 of the 1073
Revised Code, shall be allowed from the later of the date the 1074
payment was due or the date payment was made. Except as provided 1075
in section 5755.06 of the Revised Code, the tax commissioner 1076
may, with the consent of the taxpayer, provide for crediting 1077
against the tax due for a tax period, the amount of any refund 1078
due the taxpayer for a preceding tax period. 1079
Sec. 5755.051. As used in this section, "debt to the 1080

S. B. No. 28 Page 38
As Introduced
state" means unpaid taxes that are due the state, unpaid 1081
workers' compensation premiums that are due, unpaid unemployment 1082
compensation contributions that are due, unpaid unemployment 1083
compensation payments in lieu of contributions that are due, 1084
unpaid fees payable to the state or to the clerk of courts under 1085
section 4505.06 of the Revised Code, incorrect medical 1086
assistance payments, or any unpaid charge, penalty, or interest 1087
arising from any of the foregoing. A debt to the state is not a 1088
"debt to the state" as used in this section unless the liability 1089
underlying the debt to the state has become incontestable 1090
because the time for appealing, reconsidering, reassessing, or 1091
otherwise questioning the liability has expired or the liability 1092
has been finally determined to be valid. 1093
If a taxpayer who is entitled to a refund under section 1094
5755.05 of the Revised Code owes a debt to the state, the amount 1095
refundable may be applied in satisfaction of the debt to the 1096
state. If the amount refundable is less than the amount of the 1097
debt to the state, the amount refundable may be applied in 1098
partial satisfaction of the debt. If the amount refundable is 1099
greater than the amount of the debt, the amount refundable 1100
remaining after satisfaction of the debt shall be refunded to 1101
the taxpayer. 1102
Sec. 5755.052. No person shall knowingly make, present, 1103
aid, or assist in the preparation or presentation of a false or 1104
fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or 1105
document authorized or required by law to be filed with the 1106
department of taxation, the treasurer of state, a county 1107
auditor, a county treasurer, or a county clerk of courts, or 1108
knowingly procure, counsel, or advise the preparation or 1109
presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, 1110
or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly 1111

S. B. No. 28 Page 39

procure, counsel, or advise such change, alteration, or 1112
amendment of the records upon which such report, return, 1113
schedule, statement, claim, or document is based with intent to 1114
defraud the state or any of its subdivisions. With respect to 1115
such acts or conduct, no conviction shall be had under any other 1116
section of the Revised Code. 1117
Sec. 5755.06. (A)(1) The tax commissioner may issue an 1118
assessment, based on any information in the commissioner's 1119
possession, against a taxpayer who fails to pay any tax levied 1120
under section 5755.02 of the Revised Code or to file a return 1121
under section 5755.03 of the Revised Code. The tax commissioner 1122
shall give the taxpayer written notice of the assessment under 1123
section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the tax 1124
commissioner shall include instructions on how to petition for 1125
reassessment and on how to request a hearing with respect to the 1126
petition. 1127
(2) Unless the taxpayer, within sixty days after service 1128
of the notice of assessment, files with the tax commissioner, 1129
either personally or by certified mail, a written petition 1130
signed by the taxpayer, or by the taxpayer's authorized agent 1131
who has knowledge of the facts, the assessment becomes final, 1132
and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the 1133
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate 1134
the taxpayer's objections to the assessment. Additional 1135
objections may be raised in writing if they are received by the 1136
tax commissioner before the date shown on the final 1137
determination. 1138
(3) If a petition for reassessment has been properly 1139
filed, the tax commissioner shall proceed under section 5703.60 1140
of the Revised Code. 1141

S. B. No. 28 Page 40
As Introduced
(4) After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of 1142
the assessment, including penalties and accrued interest, 1143
remains unpaid, the tax commissioner may file a certified copy 1144
of the entry making the assessment final in the office of the 1145
clerk of the court of common pleas of Franklin county or in the 1146
office of the clerk of the court of common pleas of the county 1147
in which the taxpayer resides, or the taxpayer's principal place 1148
of business in this state is located. Immediately upon the 1149
filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment for the 1150
state against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the 1151
entry. The judgment has the same effect as other judgments. 1152
Execution shall issue upon the judgment at the request of the 1153
tax commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution 1154
apply to sales made under the judgment. 1155
(5) If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within 1156
sixty days after the day the assessment was issued, the portion 1157
of the assessment consisting of tax due shall bear interest at 1158
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised 1159
Code from the day the tax commissioner issued the assessment 1160
until the assessment is paid or until it is certified to the 1161
attorney general for collection under section 131.02 of the 1162
Revised Code, whichever comes first. If the unpaid portion of 1163
the assessment is certified to the attorney general for 1164
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall 1165
bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 1166
5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date of certification until 1167
the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall be paid in 1168
the same manner as the tax levied under section 5755.02 of the 1169
Revised Code and may be collected by the issuance of an 1170
assessment under this section. 1171
(B) If the tax commissioner believes that collection of 1172

S. B. No. 28 Page 41
As Introduced
the tax levied under section 5755.02 of the Revised Code will be 1173
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection 1174
of the tax are instituted without delay, the commissioner may 1175
issue a jeopardy assessment against the taxpayer that is liable 1176
for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of a jeopardy 1177
assessment, the tax commissioner shall file an entry with the 1178
clerk of the court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by 1179
division (A)(4) of this section, and the clerk shall proceed as 1180
directed in that division. Notice of the jeopardy assessment 1181
shall be served on the taxpayer or the taxpayer's authorized 1182
agent under section 5703.37 of the Revised Code within five days 1183
after the filing of the entry with the clerk. The total amount 1184
assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer 1185
assessed files a petition for reassessment under division (A)(2) 1186
of this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to 1187
the tax commissioner that is in an amount sufficient to satisfy 1188
the unpaid balance of the assessment. If a petition for 1189
reassessment has been filed, and if satisfactory security has 1190
been provided, the tax commissioner shall proceed under division 1191
(A)(3) of this section. Full or partial payment of the 1192
assessment does not prejudice the tax commissioner's 1193
consideration of the petition for reassessment. 1194
(C) The tax commissioner shall immediately forward to the 1195
treasurer of state all amounts the tax commissioner receives 1196
under this section, and the amounts forwarded shall be treated 1197
as if they were revenue arising from the tax levied under 1198
section 5755.02 of the Revised Code. 1199
(D) Except as otherwise provided in this division, no 1200
assessment shall be issued against a taxpayer for the tax levied 1201
under section 5755.02 of the Revised Code more than four years 1202
after the due date for filing the return for the tax period for 1203

S. B. No. 28 Page 42
As Introduced
which the tax was reported, or more than four years after the 1204
return for the tax period was filed, whichever is later. This 1205
division does not bar an assessment against a taxpayer who fails 1206
to file a return as required by section 5755.03 of the Revised 1207
Code or who files a fraudulent return, or when the taxpayer and 1208
the tax commissioner waive in writing the time limitation. 1209
(E) If the whereabouts of a person subject to this chapter 1210
is not known to the tax commissioner, the commissioner shall 1211
follow the procedures under section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. 1212
Sec. 5755.07. The tax commissioner shall administer and 1213
enforce this chapter. In addition to any other powers conferred 1214
upon the tax commissioner by law, the tax commissioner may do 1215
any of the following: 1216
(A) Prescribe all forms that are required to be filed 1217
under this chapter; 1218
(B) Appoint professional, technical, and clerical 1219
employees as are necessary to carry out the tax commissioner's 1220
duties under this chapter; 1221
(C) Adopt rules that are necessary and proper to carry out 1222
this chapter. 1223
Notwithstanding any provision of section 121.95 of the 1224
Revised Code to the contrary, a regulatory restriction contained 1225
in a rule adopted under this section is not subject to sections 1226
121.95 to 121.953 of the Revised Code. 1227
Sec. 5755.99. (A) Whoever violates section 5755.052 of th e 1228
Revised Code is guilty of a felony of the fifth degree and the 1229
court may impose upon the offender an additional fine of not 1230
more than seven hundred fifty thousand dollars. 1231
