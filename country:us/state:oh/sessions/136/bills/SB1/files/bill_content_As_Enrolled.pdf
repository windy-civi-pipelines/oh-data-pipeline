employer or exclusive representative desiring to terminate, modify, or negotiate a successor
collective bargaining agreement shall:
(a) Serve written notice upon the other party of the proposed termination, modification, or
successor agreement. The party must serve the notice not less than sixty days prior to the expiration

any party may serve notice upon the board and the other party setting forth the names and addresses
of the parties and offering to meet, for a period of ninety days, with the other party for the purpose of
negotiating a collective bargaining agreement.
If the settlement procedures specified in divisions (B), (C), and (D) of this section govern the
parties, where those procedures refer to the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, it means
the expiration of the sixty-day period to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement referred to in
this subdivision, or in the case of initial negotiations, it means the ninety-day period referred to in
this subdivision.
(3) The parties shall continue in full force and effect all the terms and conditions of any
existing collective bargaining agreement, without resort to strike or lock-out, for a period of sixty
days after the party gives notice or until the expiration date of the collective bargaining agreement,

(a) Conventional arbitration of all unsettled issues;
(b) Arbitration confined to a choice between the last offer of each party to the agreement as a
single package;
(c) Arbitration confined to a choice of the last offer of each party to the agreement on each

recommendations, either as a single package or on each issue submitted;
(e) Settlement by a citizens' conciliation council composed of three residents within the
jurisdiction of the public employer. The public employer shall select one member and the exclusive
representative shall select one member. The two members selected shall select the third member
who shall chair the council. If the two members cannot agree upon a third member within five days
after their appointments, the board shall appoint the third member. Once appointed, the council shall
make a final settlement of the issues submitted to it pursuant to division (G) of this section.
(f) Any other dispute settlement procedure mutually agreed to by the parties.
(2) If, fifty days before the expiration date of the collective bargaining agreement, the parties
are unable to reach an agreement, any party may request the state employment relations board to
intervene. The request shall set forth the names and addresses of the parties, the issues involved, and,
if applicable, the expiration date of any agreement.
The board shall intervene and investigate the dispute to determine whether the parties have
engaged in collective bargaining.
If an impasse exists or forty-five days before the expiration date of the collective bargaining
agreement if one exists, the board shall appoint a mediator to assist the parties in the collective
bargaining process.
(3) Any time after the appointment of a mediator, either party may request the appointment
of a fact-finding panel. Within fifteen days after receipt of a request for a fact-finding panel, the

the parties in accordance with rules established by the board, from a list of qualified persons
maintained by the board.
(a) The fact-finding panel shall, in accordance with rules and procedures established by the
board that include the regulation of costs and expenses of fact-finding, gather facts and make
recommendations for the resolution of the matter. The board shall by its rules require each party to

Sub. S. B. No. 1 136th G.A.

fact-finding panel shall make final recommendations as to all the unresolved issues.
(b) The board may continue mediation, order the parties to engage in collective bargaining
until the expiration date of the agreement, or both.
(4) The following guidelines apply to fact-finding:

feasible, in the jurisdiction of the state.
(b) The fact-finding panel shall conduct the hearing pursuant to rules established by the
board.

the dispute.

legislative body, by a three-fifths vote of its total membership, and in the case of the public
employee organization, the membership, by a three-fifths vote of the total membership, may reject
the recommendations; if neither rejects the recommendations, the recommendations shall be deemed
agreed upon as the final resolution of the issues submitted and a collective bargaining agreement
shall be executed between the parties, including the fact-finding panel's recommendations, except as
otherwise modified by the parties by mutual agreement. If either the legislative body or the public
employee organization rejects the recommendations, the board shall publicize the findings of fact
and recommendations of the fact-finding panel. The board shall adopt rules governing the
procedures and methods for public employees to vote on the recommendations of the fact-finding
panel.
