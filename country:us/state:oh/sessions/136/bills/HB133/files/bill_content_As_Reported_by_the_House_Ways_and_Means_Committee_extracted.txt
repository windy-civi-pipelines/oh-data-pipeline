individual or group sickness and accident insurance policy, to 150
make maternity benefits available to the policyholder for the 151
individual or individuals to be covered under any comparable 152
policy to be issued for delivery in this state, including family 153
members if the policy otherwise provides coverage for family 154
members. Nothing in this division shall be construed to prohibit 155
an insurer from imposing a reasonable waiting period for such 156
benefits under an individual sickness and accident insurance 157
policy issued to an individual who is not a federally eligible 158
individual or a nonemployer-related group sickness and accident 159
insurance policy, but in no event shall such waiting period 160

Sub. H. B. No. 133 Page 7
As Reported by the House Ways and Means Committee
using a predetermined formula for the assignment of liability 170
arising out of occurrences of a similar nature. Nothing in this 171
division shall be construed to prohibit an insurer from 172
determining a claimant's liability by applying formulas or 173
guidelines to the facts and circumstances disclosed by the 174
insurer's investigation of the particular occurrence upon which 175
a claim is based. 176
(Q) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, 177
or limiting the amount, extent, or kind of life or sickness and 178
accident insurance or annuity coverage available to an 179
individual, or charging an individual a different rate for the 180
same coverage solely because of blindness or partial blindness. 181
With respect to all other conditions, including the underlying 182
cause of blindness or partial blindness, persons who are blind 183
or partially blind shall be subject to the same standards of 184
sound actuarial principles or actual or reasonably anticipated 185
actuarial experience as are sighted persons. Refusal to insure 186
includes, but is not limited to, denial by an insurer of 187
disability insurance coverage on the grounds that the policy 188
defines "disability" as being presumed in the event that the 189
eyesight of the insured is lost. However, an insurer may exclude 190
from coverage disabilities consisting solely of blindness or 191
partial blindness when such conditions existed at the time the 192
policy was issued. To the extent that the provisions of this 193
division may appear to conflict with any provision of section 194

Civil Rule 65, may grant a temporary restraining order, 505

amount, not in excess of one hundred thousand dollars, equal to 521
one-half of the expenses reasonably incurred by the person in 522

this division may be reduced or denied if special circumstances 524
make an award unjust or if the person engaged in conduct that 525
unduly and unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the 526
matter in controversy. If the department does not pay such award 527
or no such funds are available, the award shall be treated as if 528

in understanding the coverages and any exclusions directly from 557
your agent or the insurance company issuing your policy. This 558
policy summary is for informational purposes only and is 559
designed to provide a basic description of insurance coverages 560
and exclusions in your policy. This summary does not reflect all 561
the coverages and exclusions contained in your policy and is 562
qualified in its entirety to the policy terms. 563
State law prohibits this policy summary from replacing, 564
modifying, altering, amending, or changing any of the terms or 565

summary meets the requirements prescribed in division (B) of 577
this section and the notice contained in division (B)(1)(d) of 578
this section appears in each section of the policy summary. If 579
the policy summary is paginated, then the notice contained in 580
division (B)(1)(d) of this section shall appear on each page. 581
(E) An insurer's election to provide or make a policy 582

provide a policy summary upon the renewal of the policy or for 584
any other policies issued to the same customer. 585

summary available for a personal lines policy of insurance, the 587
insurer shall provide a policy summary for the named insured 588
under a policy for that product. 589
(G) A policy summary provided or made available under this 590

Section 19:
section shall not be considered a replacement for the terms of 591
the policy of insurance, shall not have the effect of altering 592
the coverage afforded by the policy, and shall not confer new or 593
additional rights beyond those expressly provided for in the 594
policy. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create or 595
imply a private cause of action for a violation of this section. 596
A policy summary provided or made available pursuant to this 597

premiums, cash values, and dividends based on the insurer's 36
current dividend scale, which are used to compute the net cost 37
for such policy, and a prominent warning that the rate of 38
dividend is not guaranteed, is a misrepresentation for the 39
purposes of this division. 40

required by law to report, or who has authority by law to 69
examine into its condition or into any of its affairs, or, with 70
like intent, willfully omitting to make a true entry of any 71

make maternity benefits available to the policyholder for the 151
individual or individuals to be covered under any comparable 152
policy to be issued for delivery in this state, including family 153

benefits under an individual sickness and accident insurance 157
policy issued to an individual who is not a federally eligible 158
individual or a nonemployer-related group sickness and accident 159

using a predetermined formula for the assignment of liability 170
arising out of occurrences of a similar nature. Nothing in this 171
division shall be construed to prohibit an insurer from 172
determining a claimant's liability by applying formulas or 173
guidelines to the facts and circumstances disclosed by the 174
insurer's investigation of the particular occurrence upon which 175
a claim is based. 176
(Q) Refusing to insure, or refusing to continue to insure, 177
or limiting the amount, extent, or kind of life or sickness and 178

same coverage solely because of blindness or partial blindness. 181
With respect to all other conditions, including the underlying 182
cause of blindness or partial blindness, persons who are blind 183
or partially blind shall be subject to the same standards of 184
sound actuarial principles or actual or reasonably anticipated 185
actuarial experience as are sighted persons. Refusal to insure 186
includes, but is not limited to, denial by an insurer of 187
disability insurance coverage on the grounds that the policy 188
defines "disability" as being presumed in the event that the 189
eyesight of the insured is lost. However, an insurer may exclude 190
from coverage disabilities consisting solely of blindness or 191
partial blindness when such conditions existed at the time the 192
policy was issued. To the extent that the provisions of this 193
division may appear to conflict with any provision of section 194
3999.16 of the Revised Code, this division applies. 195

the applicant's grounds are established, and that such grounds 413
otherwise justify holding such a hearing, the superintendent 414

unless such order is stayed by a court of competent 469
jurisdiction, request the attorney general to commence and 470
prosecute any appropriate action or proceeding in the name of 471
the state against the person. 472
Such action may include, but need not be limited to, the 473
commencement of a class action under Civil Rule 23 on behalf of 474

of not more than ten thousand dollars; 492

business of insurance, may impose a single penalty in whatever 500
amount the parties determine to be justified under the 501
circumstances. 502
(H) A court of common pleas, in a civil action commenced 503
by the attorney general on behalf of the superintendent under 504
Civil Rule 65, may grant a temporary restraining order, 505
preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction to restrain or 506
prevent a violation or threatened violation of any provision of 507
section 3901.20 of the Revised Code, if the court finds that the 508
defendant has violated, is violating, or is threatening to 509
violate such provision, that immediate and irreparable injury, 510
loss, or damage will result if such relief is not granted, and 511
that no adequate remedy at law exists to prevent such 512
irreparable injury, loss, or damage. 513
(I) If the superintendent's position in initiating a 514
matter in controversy pursuant to this section and section 515
3901.221 of the Revised Code was not substantially justified, 516

Sub. H. B. No. 133 Page 19

civil action was commenced, the superintendent or the court 519
shall order the department of insurance to pay such person an 520
amount, not in excess of one hundred thousand dollars, equal to 521
one-half of the expenses reasonably incurred by the person in 522
connection with the related proceedings. An award pursuant to 523
this division may be reduced or denied if special circumstances 524
make an award unjust or if the person engaged in conduct that 525
unduly and unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the 526
matter in controversy. If the department does not pay such award 527
or no such funds are available, the award shall be treated as if 528
it were a judgment under Chapter 2743. of the Revised Code and 529
be payable in accordance with the procedures specified in 530
section 2743.19 of the Revised Code, except that interest shall 531
not be paid in relation to the award. 532

summary: 555
"You should read your insurance policy and get assistance 556
in understanding the coverages and any exclusions directly from 557
your agent or the insurance company issuing your policy. This 558
policy summary is for informational purposes only and is 559
designed to provide a basic description of insurance coverages 560
and exclusions in your policy. This summary does not reflect all 561
the coverages and exclusions contained in your policy and is 562
qualified in its entirety to the policy terms. 563
State law prohibits this policy summary from replacing, 564
modifying, altering, amending, or changing any of the terms or 565
provisions of the insurance policy that is the subject of this 566
summary." 567
(2) A policy summary, as described in division (B)(1) of 568
this section, does not include the policy declarations page and 569
any notations contained therein. 570

in division (B) of this section. 574

Sub. H. B. No. 133 Page 21
As Reported by the House Ways and Means Committee
(D) An insurer may display sections of a policy summary 575
individually, in any combination or in any order, as long as the 576
summary meets the requirements prescribed in division (B) of 577
this section and the notice contained in division (B)(1)(d) of 578
this section appears in each section of the policy summary. If 579
the policy summary is paginated, then the notice contained in 580
division (B)(1)(d) of this section shall appear on each page. 581
(E) An insurer's election to provide or make a policy 582
summary available to a customer does not obligate the insurer to 583
provide a policy summary upon the renewal of the policy or for 584
any other policies issued to the same customer. 585
(F) If an insurer elects to provide or make a policy 586
summary available for a personal lines policy of insurance, the 587
insurer shall provide a policy summary for the named insured 588
under a policy for that product. 589
(G) A policy summary provided or made available under this 590
section shall not be considered a replacement for the terms of 591
the policy of insurance, shall not have the effect of altering 592
the coverage afforded by the policy, and shall not confer new or 593
additional rights beyond those expressly provided for in the 594
policy. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create or 595
imply a private cause of action for a violation of this section. 596
A policy summary provided or made available pursuant to this 597
section shall not be admissible in court or in any other legal 598
or administrative proceeding, except to enforce division (H) of 599
this section. 600

state shall provide or use a policy summary that contains any 602

(I) Any violation of this section is an unfair and 604
deceptive act or practice in the business of insurance under 605
sections 3901.19 to 3901.26 of the Revised Code. If the 606
superintendent, by written order, finds that any person is about 607
to engage, is engaging, or has engaged in a violation of this 608
section, the superintendent may impose any or all of the 609
administrative remedies set forth in divisions (D)(1) to (5)(6) 610
of section 3901.22 of the Revised Code, as applicable. If the 611
superintendent finds that the violation was due to gross or 612
willful misconduct, the superintendent may order that person to 613
reimburse any customer harmed by the violation or violations, 614
including reimbursement or payment of insurance claims for which 615
a loss occurred as a result of a customer's reliance upon a 616

arrangement, cumulatively and regardless of any particular 639
employee's length of tenure, during the taxpayer's taxable year. 640
