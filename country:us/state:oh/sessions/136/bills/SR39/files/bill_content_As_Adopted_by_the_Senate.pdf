In memory of Alan J. Zaleski.
WHEREAS, The members of the Senate of the 136th General Assembly 1
of Ohio were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Alan J. Zaleski 2
and extend our heartfelt condolences to his family and friends; and 3
WHEREAS, Alan Zaleski left an indelible impression on the people 4
whose lives he touched, and he will be remembered as a spirited 5
individual who contributed immeasurably to the world around him. A 6
decorated U.S. Marine Corps veteran of the Vietnam War, he was a stock 7
broker and an assistant vice president, the owner of Arthur Products, 8
and a parishioner of Saint Mary Catholic Church, and he served his 9
fellow citizens as a city councilman and a county commissioner before 10
being elected as a member of the Ohio Senate, representing the 13th 11
District from 1982 to 1998. Indeed, his love for Ohio and his sincere 12
desire to serve its people to the best of his ability have shown him 13
to be a truly concerned and responsible public servant; and 14
WHEREAS, Alan Zaleskiâ€™s regard for improving the quality of life 15
in our society was clearly evident in his personal sacrifices of time 16
and effort to his family, friends, and community. Giving generously of 17
his energy and abilities in all of his endeavors, he displayed 18
exceptional concern and insight, and his absence will be keenly felt; 19
and 20

As Adopted by the Senate
WHEREAS, A loving husband to his wife of thirty-eight years, 21
Debra, a devoted father to his children, Alison and Matthew, a caring 22
grandfather to his grandson, Otto, and a cherished brother to his 23
siblings, Madeline and Ronald, Alan Zaleski always used his talents to 24
the benefit of others, and the laurels of his life stand as a tribute 25
not only to him but also to those he left behind. Although the void 26
his death has created can never be filled, the legacy of care and 27
commitment he established will surely live on. The world is a richer 28
place for his having been in it, and he will be sorely missed; 29
therefore be it 30
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the Senate of the 136th General 31
Assembly of Ohio, in adopting this Resolution, express a profound 32
sense of loss and sincere regret at the death of Alan J. Zaleski and, 33
in so doing, pay tribute to the memory of a truly unique individual; 34
and be it further 35
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit a duly 36
authenticated copy of this Resolution to the family of Alan J. 37
Zaleski. 38
