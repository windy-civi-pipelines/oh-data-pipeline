the use, or the availability for use, of the sanitary facilities 8
of a sewer district to be paid by every person and public agency 9
whose premises are served, or capable of being served, by a 10

it enters into a contract for that use. 19
(B) The board also shall establish reasonable charges to 20
be collected for the privilege of connecting to the sanitary 21
facilities of the district, with the requirement that, prior to 22
the connection, the charges shall be paid in full, or, if 23
determined by the board to be equitable in a resolution relating 24
to the payment of the charges, provision considered adequate by 25
the board shall be made for their payment in installments at the 26
times, in the amounts, and with the security, carrying charges, 27
and penalties as may be found by the board in that resolution to 28
be fair and appropriate. No public agency or person shall be 29
permitted to connect to those facilities until the charges have 30
been paid in full or provision for their payment in installments 31
has been made. If the connection charges are to be paid in 32
installments, the board shall certify to the county auditor 33
information sufficient to identify each parcel of property 34
served by a connection and, with respect to each parcel, the 35
total of the charges to be paid in installments, the amount of 36
each installment, and the total number of installments to be 37
paid. The auditor shall record and maintain the information 38
supplied in the sewer improvement record provided for in section 39

(C) When any of the sanitary rates or charges are not paid 44
when due, the board may do any or all of the following as it 45
considers appropriate: 46

by the connection. The certified amount shall be a lien on the 50
property from the date placed on the real property tax list and 51
duplicate and shall be collected in the same manner as taxes, 52
except that, notwithstanding section 323.15 of the Revised Code, 53
a county treasurer shall accept a payment in that amount when 54
separately tendered as payment for the full amount of the unpaid 55
sanitary rates or charges and associated penalties. The lien 56
shall be released immediately upon payment in full of the 57
certified amount. 58
(2) Collect the unpaid rates or charges, together with any 59
penalties, by actions at law in the name of the county from an 60
owner, tenant, or other person or public agency that is liable 61
for the payment of the rates or charges; 62
(3) Terminate, in accordance with established rules, the 63
sanitary service to the particular property and, if so 64
determined, any county water service to that property, unless 65

be made for their payment in installments at the times, in the 124
amounts, and with the security, carrying charges, and penalties 125
as may be found by the board in that resolution to be fair and 126
appropriate. The board may include amounts attributable to 127
connection charges being paid in installments in its billings of 128
rates and charges for the services provided by the drainage 129
facilities. In the case of rates and charges that are fixed in 130

real property taxes, provided that the board certifies to the 135
county auditor information that is sufficient for the auditor to 136
identify each parcel of property for which a rate or charge is 137
levied and the amount of the rate or charge. 138
