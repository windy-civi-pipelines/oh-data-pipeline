(E) Any appeal of a biomarker testing coverage policy 102
shall be handled in accordance with section 5160.31 of the 103
Revised Code. The appeal process shall be made readily 104

Section 2. It is the intent of the General Assembly to 109
ensure coverage for appropriate biomarker testing supported by 110

healthcare cost savings and improving health outcomes for 113
Ohioans covered under this act. The General Assembly does not 114
intend to create a landscape which allows manufacturers and 115
administrators of biomarker tests to substantially increase 116
pricing for existing and new biomarker tests as a result of the 117
coverage requirements for certain health insurance markets under 118
this act. 119
