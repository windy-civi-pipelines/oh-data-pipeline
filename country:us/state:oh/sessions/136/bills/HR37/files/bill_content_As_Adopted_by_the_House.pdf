Regular Session H. R. No. 37
2025-2026
Representative Thomas, C.
A R E S O L U T I O N
Recognizing Multiple System Atrophy Awareness Month
in Ohio.
WHEREAS, The members of the House of Representatives of the 136th 1
General Assembly of Ohio are pleased to recognize March 2025 as 2
Multiple System Atrophy Awareness Month; and 3
WHEREAS, Multiple System Atrophy Awareness Month provides a unique 4
opportunity to highlight an issue of great importance to our state. 5
Formerly known as Shy-Drager Syndrome, MSA is a rare and fatal 6
neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure, and its various 7
symptoms, which include impairments to balance, difficulty with 8
movement, poor coordination, bladder dysfunction, sleep disturbance, 9
and poor blood pressure control, can have a tremendous impact on a 10
personâ€™s quality of life; and 11
WHEREAS, Incidents of MSA are often misdiagnosed as other 12
neurodegenerative diseases due to an overlapping of symptoms, and the 13
obscure nature of this condition has left many patients struggling to 14
find relief. In an effort to overcome these challenges, Multiple 15
System Atrophy Awareness Month was designated by the 129th General 16
Assembly of Ohio in 2013, and in the twelve years since, it has helped 17
to increase public understanding of this disorder among the residents 18
of Ohio; and 19
WHEREAS, It is through the work of caring and conscientious 20
individuals such as all those associated with the observance of 21
Multiple System Atrophy Awareness Month that our state has gained a 22
reputation for the diligence and concern of its citizens. Indeed, we 23
applaud the many people who have played a role in bringing attention 24
to this progressive neurological disease; therefore be it 25
