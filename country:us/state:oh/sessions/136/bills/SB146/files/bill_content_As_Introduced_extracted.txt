(G)(1) The general assembly, in enacting this section, 110

common law causes of action and remedies involving claims for 113
damages or civil penalties brought against a covered person. 114
Nothing in this section shall be construed as creating a right 115
or cause of action that did not exist under the common law as it 116
existed on the effective date of this section. 117

enacted by this act, is remedial in nature. Therefore, it is the 119
intent of the general assembly in enacting this section to 120
provide for both the prospective and retroactive application of 121
the codification of the common law doctrine of piercing the 122
corporate veil, and the abrogation of statutory and common law 123
causes of action and remedies involving damages or civil 124
penalties from a covered person, including those actions that 125
are pending on the effective date of this act. If, however, the 126
supreme court determines, in any litigation that may be 127
commenced to contest the constitutionality of this section, that 128
the retroactive application of any provision of this section 129
would be violative of either the United States Constitution or 130
the Ohio Constitution, it is the intent of the general assembly 131
that the severability provision of section 1.50 of the Revised 132
Code be applied, that the retroactive application of the 133
S. B. No. 146 Page 6
As Introduced
contested provision be severed, and that the remaining 134
provisions of this section be given prospective application 135
consistent with section 1.48 of the Revised Code. 136
