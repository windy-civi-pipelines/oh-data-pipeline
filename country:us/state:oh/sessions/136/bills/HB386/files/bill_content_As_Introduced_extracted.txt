are present, the probate judge shall grant the marriage license. 44
If the judge is satisfied from the affidavit of a 45
reputable physician, clinical nurse specialist, or certified 46
nurse practitioner in active practice and residing in the county 47
where the probate court is located, that one of the parties is 48
unable to appear in court, by reason of illness or other 49

marriage; but in that case the person who is unable to appear in 52
