Control and Prevention (CDC), fentanyl has become the number one 11
cause of death for Americans eighteen to forty-five years of 12
age; and 13
WHEREAS, According to the CDC, pharmaceutical fentanyl is 14
prescribed by physicians and other authorized health care 15
providers to treat severe pain, especially after surgery or for 16

As Introduced
criminal drug markets in different forms, including liquid or 21
powder, making its detection complex and its distinction from 22
other drugs increasingly difficult; and 23
WHEREAS, According to the CDC, fentanyl and drugs similar 24
in chemical structure to fentanyl are being mixed into 25
counterfeit opioid pills, heroin, cocaine, marijuana, and 26
methamphetamine, and people who use only non-opioid drugs are 27
more likely to overdose if they are exposed to drugs mixed with 28
opioids, including fentanyl; and 29
WHEREAS, According to the National Center for Health 30
Statistics, overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids, 31
primarily fentanyl, were estimated to be 74,702 in 2023; and 32

fentanyl was involved in seventy-eight per cent of Ohio's 34
unintentional drug overdose deaths in 2023; and 35
WHEREAS, United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 36
seized more than twenty-one thousand pounds of illicit fentanyl 37
in federal fiscal year 2024; and 38
WHEREAS, CBP's fentanyl seizures have increased more than 39
eight hundred per cent since federal fiscal year 2019; and 40
WHEREAS, The dangers of fentanyl are further evidenced by 41
such events as those in 2002 when, in response to Chechen rebels 42
taking over eight hundred hostages in a Moscow theater, Russia 43
deployed an unknown gas, later confirmed by the Russian Health 44
Minister to contain fentanyl-related compounds, to neutralize 45
the rebels, which resulted in the death of 117 hostages from 46
effects of the gas; now therefore be it 47
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the 136th General 48
Assembly of the State of Ohio, urge the 119th United States 49
Congress to introduce and pass legislation that is similar to a 50
previous proposal known as the Stop Our Scourge Act of 2023, 51
