health care facility, or pharmacy meets the following minimum 77

willing to prescribe the drug, the hospital or inpatient 112
facility shall not obstruct or intentionally delay the transfer 113
of that patient to another hospital, inpatient facility, or 114
hospice that is willing to accept and treat the patient, nor 115
shall the hospital or inpatient facility prevent the patient's 116
discharge if that is the wish of the patient or the patient's 117
personal representative. 118
(6) When there is a safety concern regarding a 119
prescription for a drug, including a drug for off-label use, a 120
pharmacist should discuss any prescription dosage 121
recommendations or other clinical concerns with the physician, 122
the patient, or the patient's personal representative. There 123
should be risk-benefit discussions between the physician, the 124
patient or the patient's personal representative, and other 125
inpatient and outpatient medical staff directly involved in the 126
patient's care. Outside of emergency situations, the ultimate 127
decision to take a drug, including a drug for off-label use, 128
prescribed by the physician should be made by the consenting 129
patient or the patient's personal representative. 130

not want to wait for prior authorization, the physician or 133
pharmacist shall notify the patient of the option to pay for the 134
drug out of pocket. The physician or pharmacist must notify the 135
patient of the estimated out-of-pocket costs for the drug, and 136

cost to the patient. 138

health-related licensing board, the department of health, or 140
another state agency responsible for the licensure or regulation 141
of health care professionals or health care facilities shall not 142
consider the action of prescribing, dispensing, or administering 143
a drug to a consenting patient or with the consent of the 144
patient's personal representative, including for off-label use, 145
by a physician, pharmacist, hospital, inpatient facility, 146
outpatient health care facility, or pharmacy under this section 147
to be unlawful, unethical, unauthorized, or unprofessional 148
conduct and shall not pursue professional discipline or fines or 149
other regulatory sanctions against the physician, pharmacist, 150
hospital, facility, or pharmacy except in cases where a court 151
has determined that the prescribing, dispensing, or 152
administering of the drug to that patient was done with 153
recklessness or gross negligence. This section does not provide 154
a physician immunity from civil liability. Except as provided in 155
division (B)(2) of this section, this section does not provide a 156
pharmacist, hospital, inpatient facility, outpatient health care 157
facility, or pharmacy immunity from civil liability. 158
(E) A health care professional should be free to engage 159
in scientific debate. A health-related licensing board, the 160
department of health, or other state agency responsible for the 161
licensure or regulation of health care professionals shall not 162
pursue or threaten to pursue professional discipline or fines or 163
other regulatory sanctions against a physician, pharmacist, or 164
