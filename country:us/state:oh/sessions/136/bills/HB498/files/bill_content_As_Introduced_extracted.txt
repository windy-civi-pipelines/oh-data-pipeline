division (B)(1) of this section. 199
(C) As part of its charge to the jury in a criminal case, 200
the court shall read the definitions of "reasonable doubt" and 201
"proof beyond a reasonable doubt," contained in division (E) of 202
this section. 203
(D) As used in this section: 204
(1) An "affirmative defense" is either of the following: 205
(a) A defense expressly designated as affirmative; 206

peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused, on which the 208
accused can fairly be required to adduce supporting evidence. 209

cannot say they are firmly convinced of the truth of the charge. 224
It is a doubt based on reason and common sense. Reasonable doubt 225
is not mere possible doubt, because everything relating to human 226
affairs or depending on moral evidence is open to some possible 227
or imaginary doubt. "Proof beyond a reasonable doubt" is proof 228

rely and act upon it in the most important of the person's own 230
affairs. 231

or safety or the life or safety of another. 241
(3) "Residence" has the same meaning as in section 2901.05 242
of the Revised Code. 243
(B) For purposes of any section of the Revised Code that 244
sets forth a criminal offense, a the following apply: 245
(1) A person who is not engaged in illegal activity has no 246
duty to retreat from any place where the person is lawfully 247
present before using or threatening to use reasonable force, 248

prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or safety. 257
(3) A person has no duty to retreat before using force in 258

necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or safety is 266
justified in the use of or threat to use reasonable force, 267
including deadly force, when the person reasonably believes that 268
such force is necessary to defend the person or another from any 269
actual or imminent use of unlawful force. 270
(4) A person is justified in the use of or threat to use 271
reasonable force, including deadly force, even if an alternative 272
course of action is available. 273
(5) A person may be wrong in the estimation of the danger 274
or the force necessary to repel the danger as long as there is a 275
reasonable basis for the person's belief, and the person acts 276
reasonably in response to that belief. 277

the person or the aggressor. 298
(3) A person who uses force to resist an unlawful arrest, 299
if the person uses the force against a peace officer and the 300
person using the force knows the person making the arrest is a 301
peace officer; 302
(4) A person who uses force to resist a lawful arrest, if 303
the person uses the force against a person making the arrest or 304
against a person assisting in making the arrest; 305

is committing or is about to commit a forcible felony and who 326
uses or threatens to use reasonable force, including deadly 327
force, as authorized under section 2901.09 of the Revised Code, 328

and convincing evidence as described in divisions (A) and 198
division (B)(1) of this section. 199
(C) As part of its charge to the jury in a criminal case, 200
the court shall read the definitions of "reasonable doubt" and 201
"proof beyond a reasonable doubt," contained in division (E) of 202
this section. 203
(D) As used in this section: 204
(1) An "affirmative defense" is either of the following: 205
(a) A defense expressly designated as affirmative; 206

peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused, on which the 208
accused can fairly be required to adduce supporting evidence. 209
(2) "Dwelling" means a building or conveyance of any kind 210

cannot say they are firmly convinced of the truth of the charge. 224
It is a doubt based on reason and common sense. Reasonable doubt 225
is not mere possible doubt, because everything relating to human 226
affairs or depending on moral evidence is open to some possible 227
or imaginary doubt. "Proof beyond a reasonable doubt" is proof 228

rely and act upon it in the most important of the person's own 230
affairs. 231

or safety or the life or safety of another. 241
(3) "Residence" has the same meaning as in section 2901.05 242
of the Revised Code. 243
(B) For purposes of any section of the Revised Code that 244
sets forth a criminal offense, a the following apply: 245
(1) A person who is not engaged in illegal activity has no 246
duty to retreat from any place where the person is lawfully 247

necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or safety is 266
justified in the use of or threat to use reasonable force, 267
including deadly force, when the person reasonably believes that 268
such force is necessary to defend the person or another from any 269
actual or imminent use of unlawful force. 270
(4) A person is justified in the use of or threat to use 271
reasonable force, including deadly force, even if an alternative 272
course of action is available. 273
(5) A person may be wrong in the estimation of the danger 274
or the force necessary to repel the danger as long as there is a 275
reasonable basis for the person's belief, and the person acts 276
reasonably in response to that belief. 277

the person uses the force against a person making the arrest or 304
against a person assisting in making the arrest; 305

is committing or is about to commit a forcible felony and who 326
uses or threatens to use reasonable force, including deadly 327
