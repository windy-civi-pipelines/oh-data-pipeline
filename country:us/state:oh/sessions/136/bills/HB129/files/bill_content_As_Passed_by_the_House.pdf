As Passed by the House
(2) Taxes levied within the one per cent limitation 18
imposed by Section 2 of Article XII, Ohio Constitution; 19
(3) Taxes provided for by the charter of a municipal 20
corporation. 21
(B) As used in this section: 22
(1) "Real property" includes real property owned by a 23
railroad. 24
(2) "Carryover property" means all real property on the 25
current year's tax list except: 26
(a) Land and improvements that were not taxed by the 27
district in both the preceding year and the current year; 28
(b) Land and improvements that were not in the same class 29
in both the preceding year and the current year. 30
(3) "Effective tax rate" means with respect to each class 31
of property: 32
(a) The sum of the total taxes that would have been 33
charged and payable for current expenses against real property 34
in that class if each of the district's taxes were reduced for 35
the current year under division (D)(1) of this section without 36
regard to the application of division (E)(3) of this section 37
divided by 38
(b) The taxable value of all real property in that class. 39
(4) "Taxes charged and payable" means the taxes charged 40
and payable prior to any reduction required by section 319.302 41

(C) The tax commissioner shall make the determinations 43
required by this section each year, without regard to whether a 44

Sub. H. B. No. 129 Page 3
As Passed by the House
taxing district has territory in a county to which section 45
5715.24 of the Revised Code applies for that year. Separate 46
determinations shall be made for each of the two classes 47
established pursuant to section 5713.041 of the Revised Code. 48
(D) With respect to each tax authorized to be levied by 49
each taxing district, the tax commissioner, annually, shall do 50
both of the following: 51
(1) Determine by what percentage, if any, the sums levied 52
by such tax against the carryover property in each class would 53
have to be reduced for the tax to levy the same number of 54
dollars against such property in that class in the current year 55
as were charged against such property by such tax in the 56
preceding year subsequent to the reduction made under this 57
section but before the reduction made under section 319.302 of 58
the Revised Code. In the case of a tax levied for the first time 59
that is not a renewal of an existing tax, the commissioner shall 60
determine by what percentage the sums that would otherwise be 61
levied by such tax against carryover property in each class 62
would have to be reduced to equal the amount that would have 63
been levied if the full rate thereof had been imposed against 64
the total taxable value of such property in the preceding tax 65
year. 66
(2) Certify each percentage determined in division (D)(1) 67
of this section, as adjusted under division (E) of this section, 68
and the class of property to which that percentage applies to 69
the auditor of each county in which the district has territory. 70
The auditor, after complying with section 319.30 of the Revised 71
Code, shall reduce the sum to be levied by such tax against each 72
parcel of real property in the district by the percentage so 73
certified for its class. Certification shall be made by the 74

Sub. H. B. No. 129 Page 4
As Passed by the House
first day of September except in the case of a tax levied for 75
the first time, in which case certification shall be made within 76
fifteen days of the date the county auditor submits the 77
information necessary to make the required determination. 78
(E)(1) As used in division (E)(2) of this section, "pre- 79
1982 joint vocational taxes" means, with respect to a class of 80
property, the difference between the following amounts: 81
(a) The taxes charged and payable in tax year 1981 against 82
the property in that class for the current expenses of the joint 83
vocational school district of which the school district is a 84
part after making all reductions under this section; 85
(b) Two-tenths of one per cent of the taxable value of all 86
real property in that class. 87
If the amount in division (E)(1)(b) of this section 88
exceeds the amount in division (E)(1)(a) of this section, the 89
pre-1982 joint vocational taxes shall be zero. 90
As used in divisions (E)(2) and (3) of this section, 91
"taxes charged and payable" has the same meaning as in division 92
(B)(4) of this section and excludes any tax charged and payable 93
in 1985 or thereafter from a tax levied under sections 5705.194 94
to 5705.197 or section 5705.194 or 5705.199, 5705.213, 5705.219, 95
or 5748.09 of the Revised Code that is approved by electors at 96
an election held before January 1, 2026, until the first tax 97
year, starting in tax year 2026, that section 5715.24 applies in 98
a county that includes territory of the school district. 99
(2) If in the case of a school district other than a joint 100
vocational or cooperative education school district any 101
percentage required to be used in division (D)(2) of this 102
section for either class of property could cause the total taxes 103

Sub. H. B. No. 129 Page 5
As Passed by the House
charged and payable for current expenses to be less than two per 104
cent of the taxable value of all real property in that class 105
that is subject to taxation by the district, the commissioner 106
shall determine what percentages would cause the district's 107
total taxes charged and payable for current expenses against 108
that class, after all reductions that would otherwise be made 109
under this section, to equal, when combined with the pre-1982 110
joint vocational taxes against that class, the lesser of the 111
following: 112
(a) The sum of the rates at which those taxes are 113
authorized to be levied; 114
(b) Two per cent of the taxable value of the property in 115
that class. The auditor shall use such percentages in making the 116
reduction required by this section for that class. 117
(3) If in the case of a joint vocational school district 118
any percentage required to be used in division (D)(2) of this 119
section for either class of property could cause the total taxes 120
charged and payable for current expenses for that class to be 121
less than two-tenths of one per cent of the taxable value of 122
that class, the commissioner shall determine what percentages 123
would cause the district's total taxes charged and payable for 124
current expenses for that class, after all reductions that would 125
otherwise be made under this section, to equal that amount. The 126
auditor shall use such percentages in making the reductions 127
required by this section for that class. 128
(4) If a school district is affected by division (E)(2) or 129
(3) of this section for either class of property, and additional 130
current expense taxes are levied or are included in the 131
definition of taxes charged and payable, then, for the first tax 132
year those taxes are levied or included, the reduction computed 133

Sub. H. B. No. 129 Page 6
As Passed by the House
under division (D) of this section for that district shall be 134
computed as though the sums of current expenses taxes levied for 135
the district and charged against that class in the preceding tax 136
year were equivalent to two per cent or two-tenths of one per 137
cent, respectively, of the taxable value of all real property in 138
that class. 139
(F) No reduction shall be made under this section in the 140
rate at which any tax is levied. 141
(G) The commissioner may order a county auditor to furnish 142
any information the commissioner needs to make the 143
determinations required under division (D) or (E) of this 144
section, and the auditor shall supply the information in the 145
form and by the date specified in the order. If the auditor 146
fails to comply with an order issued under this division, except 147
for good cause as determined by the commissioner, the 148
commissioner shall withhold from such county or taxing district 149
therein fifty per cent of state revenues to local governments 150
pursuant to section 5747.50 of the Revised Code or shall direct 151
the department of education and workforce to withhold therefrom 152
fifty per cent of state revenues to school districts pursuant to 153
Chapter 3317. of the Revised Code. The commissioner shall 154
withhold the distribution of such revenues until the county 155
auditor has complied with this division, and the department 156
shall withhold the distribution of such revenues until the 157
commissioner has notified the department that the county auditor 158
has complied with this division. 159
(H) If the commissioner is unable to certify a tax 160
reduction factor for either class of property in a taxing 161
district located in more than one county by the last day of 162
November because information required under division (G) of this 163

Sub. H. B. No. 129 Page 7
As Passed by the House
section is unavailable, the commissioner may compute and certify 164
an estimated tax reduction factor for that district for that 165
class. The estimated factor shall be based upon an estimate of 166
the unavailable information. Upon receipt of the actual 167
information for a taxing district that received an estimated tax 168
reduction factor, the commissioner shall compute the actual tax 169
reduction factor and use that factor to compute the taxes that 170
should have been charged and payable against each parcel of 171
property for the year for which the estimated reduction factor 172
was used. The amount by which the estimated factor resulted in 173
an overpayment or underpayment in taxes on any parcel shall be 174
added to or subtracted from the amount due on that parcel in the 175
ensuing tax year. 176
A percentage or a tax reduction factor determined or 177
computed by the commissioner under this section shall be used 178
solely for the purpose of reducing the sums to be levied by the 179
tax to which it applies for the year for which it was determined 180
or computed. It shall not be used in making any tax computations 181
for any ensuing tax year. 182
(I) In making the determinations under division (D)(1) of 183
this section, the tax commissioner shall take account of changes 184
in the taxable value of carryover property resulting from 185
complaints filed under section 5715.19 of the Revised Code for 186
determinations made for the tax year in which such changes are 187
reported to the commissioner. Such changes shall be reported to 188
the commissioner on the first abstract of real property filed 189
with the commissioner under section 5715.23 of the Revised Code 190
following the date on which the complaint is finally determined 191
by the board of revision or by a court or other authority with 192
jurisdiction on appeal. The tax commissioner shall account for 193
such changes in making the determinations only for the tax year 194

Sub. H. B. No. 129 Page 8
As Passed by the House
in which the change in valuation is reported. Such a valuation 195
change shall not be used to recompute the percentages determined 196
under division (D)(1) of this section for any prior tax year. 197
Sec. 323.32. As used in this section, "railroad note" 198
means a note issued pursuant to a court order in the 199
reorganization of a railroad company under section 77 of the 200
Bankruptcy Act. 201
Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the 202
contrary, with respect to all payments received in settlement of 203
claims arising from delinquent property tax charges and ordered 204
to be paid by a railroad company under a plan of reorganization 205
as ordered by a federal district court in accordance with 206
provisions of Chapter VIII of the "Federal Bankruptcy Act," 11 207
U.S.C.A. 201-208, the following provisions shall apply: 208
(A) Except as provided in division (H) of this section, 209
all of such payments shall be made payable, and delivered, to 210
the county in which the taxing district sharing in a claim for 211
delinquent taxes is located. Any notes included in such payment 212
shall be issued to such county treasurer, who shall be the 213
custodian of all of said notes, and who shall be liable therefor 214
upon the treasurer's bond until such time as said notes mature, 215
are sold, or otherwise lawfully pass from the treasurer's 216
custody. 217
(B) Upon receipt of a payment by cash or check, the county 218
treasurer shall immediately cause such funds to be paid into the 219
county treasury and credited to a special fund established for 220
this purpose, which shall be known as the "undivided bankruptcy 221
claims fund." All of such moneys so received, including any 222
earned interest, shall be credited to said fund. 223

Sub. H. B. No. 129 Page 9
As Passed by the House
(C) When the total claim for each county has been 224
satisfied by the receipt of cash or notes, or both, the county 225
auditor shall remit from the tax list and duplicate of real and 226
public utility property in each county, all charges appearing 227
thereon in the name of the railroad company for which such 228
payment has been made, which are delinquent and unpaid from any 229
year previous to the tax year 1977. 230
(D) At any time that funds are present in the undivided 231
bankruptcy claims fund, either upon initial settlement or at any 232
later time, the county auditor shall, forthwith, distribute by 233
auditors' warrant, such funds to the various taxing districts of 234
the county, in which the property taxes, from which the claim in 235
bankruptcy has derived, were originally charged. The funds so 236
distributed shall be apportioned among the various taxing 237
authorities within each taxing district in the same proportions 238
as the said taxes were originally levied, taking into account 239
the various rates of taxation levied for different purposes for 240
each year in which such taxes were charged and remained unpaid, 241
and any unpaid special assessments, including compound interest 242
thereon at the rate of six per cent per annum to January 1, 243
1978. 244
In making such distribution, the auditor shall, first, 245
deduct an amount equal to one per cent of the total amount to be 246
distributed, as fees for services of the county auditor and 247
treasurer in making collection and distribution of the claim in 248
bankruptcy. Such deduction shall be in lieu of all fees provided 249
for in sections 319.54 and 321.26 of the Revised Code. The 250
amount so deducted shall be credited to the general fund of the 251
county. 252
If any funds received pursuant to this section represent 253

Sub. H. B. No. 129 Page 10
As Passed by the House
taxes which, if collected, would have resulted from any general 254
or emergency levy which has since expired, such funds may be 255
credited to the general operating fund and expended as though 256
they are proceeds from a current levy, and if any of such funds 257
represent taxes from any current general bond retirement levy or 258
one which has since expired, said funds may be credited to the 259
current bond retirement fund and used to service any current 260
bond indebtedness, or may be credited to the general operating 261
fund of the district, if so designated by a majority of the 262
members of the taxing authority of the taxing district. 263
(E) Except as provided in division (H) of this section, 264
when, as a part of the settlement of a claim in bankruptcy of a 265
reorganized railroad company a county receives notes on behalf 266
of a taxing authority in partial payment of said claim, the 267
county treasurer shall, within a reasonable length of time, 268
notify the taxing authority of each taxing district sharing in 269
the claim that such notes are in the treasurer's custody. Within 270
sixty days of receipt of such notice, each taxing authority 271
shall decide by a resolution approved by a majority of its 272
members whether: 273
(1) The notes shall remain in custody of the county 274
treasurer, as issued, and allowed to mature according to the 275
terms presented on their face with the proceeds to be 276
distributed upon maturity pursuant to division (D) of this 277
section; or 278
(2) The railroad notes shall be exchanged for several new 279
notes in denominations equal to the proportionate share, or 280
portion thereof, of the taxing district having a share in the 281
claim in bankruptcy as determined in division (D) of this 282
section. The new notes shall be distributed, upon receipt, to 283

Sub. H. B. No. 129 Page 11
As Passed by the House
each taxing authority in full satisfaction of its claim or in 284
full satisfaction of the portion of its claim represented by the 285
notes so received. If notes cannot be issued in denominations 286
equal to the taxing district's proportionate share, the 287
treasurer shall certify to the taxing authority of the district 288
the amount of notes held by the treasurer on behalf of the 289
district and for which notes cannot be issued pursuant to the 290
taxing authority's decision under this subdivision. Upon receipt 291
of such certification, the taxing authority may borrow money and 292
issue notes against such certification in the same manner as is 293
provided by division (F) of this section. 294
If a taxing authority elects the option provided under 295
division (E)(1) of this section, it may at any subsequent time 296
elect instead the option provided under division (E)(2) of this 297
section by resolution approved by a majority of its members. The 298
election of the option provided under division (E)(2) of this 299
section becomes final upon receipt by the taxing authority of 300
the new notes or certification distributed by the county 301
treasurer under such division. 302
Each taxing authority shall certify a copy of any 303
resolution adopted under this division to the county treasurer 304
who shall take appropriate action as directed by each taxing 305
authority. 306
(F) A taxing authority having possession of any railroad 307
note or a treasurer's certification issued under division (E)(2) 308
of this section may, by approval of a majority of its members, 309
borrow money and issue its note in anticipation of the revenue 310
payable on maturity of the railroad note and pledge the railroad 311
note or the proceeds thereof. Such anticipation note shall 312
mature no later than the railroad note and shall be in an amount 313

Sub. H. B. No. 129 Page 12
As Passed by the House
no greater than seventy per cent of the face amount of said 314
railroad note. By like action a taxing authority may sell any 315
railroad note in its possession at public or private offering 316
for not less than the prevailing market price. Such a sale or 317
borrowing shall be exempt from all other requirements and 318
limitations of the Revised Code, including the requirements of 319
the Uniform Bond Law. 320
(1) If a taxing authority desires to issue delinquent tax 321
bonds pursuant to section 131.23 of the Revised Code prior to 322
either receipt of any payment from a railroad in bankruptcy or 323
utilization of the authority granted in this section, the taxing 324
authority may determine whether or not the net amount of 325
delinquent taxes unpledged for purposes of division (B)(5) of 326
section 131.23 of the Revised Code shall include all or part of 327
the delinquent taxes owed by a railroad, or, if notes have been 328
received pursuant to this section, the unpaid principal amount 329
of such notes. If the taxing authority determines that any such 330
railroad delinquencies or note amount shall be included under 331
section 131.23 of the Revised Code, the amount which may be 332
borrowed pursuant to this section may not exceed seventy per 333
cent of the total face amount of railroad notes remaining after 334
deducting the amount so included. 335
(2) If a taxing authority desires to issue delinquent tax 336
bonds pursuant to section 131.23 of the Revised Code after 337
utilization of the authority granted in this section, the net 338
amount of delinquent taxes unpledged for purposes of division 339
(B)(5) of section 131.23 of the Revised Code may not include the 340
principal amount of railroad notes which have been borrowed 341
against or sold pursuant to this section. 342
(G) When a taxing authority receives a railroad note, the 343

Sub. H. B. No. 129 Page 13
As Passed by the House
face amount of such note shall not be considered as revenue for 344
any purpose in the year in which the note is received. Upon sale 345
or maturity of the note, any proceeds not pledged pursuant to 346
division (F) of this section shall be considered as 347
unanticipated revenue from a new source and all of the 348
provisions of law pertaining to such revenue, including section 349
5705.36 of the Revised Code, shall apply. 350
(H) When there are present in a county nonrepresented 351
taxing districts as provided in amended substitute house bill 352
336 of the 112th general assembly, all of the provisions of this 353
section shall apply to such districts, except as follows: 354
(1) Payments by cash or check may be made payable, and 355
delivered, directly to the treasurer of the taxing district. Any 356
notes included in the settlement of the district's claim may be 357
issued, and delivered, directly to said treasurer. 358
Upon receipt of any of such payments, the treasurer of the 359
taxing district shall certify, to the county treasurer of the 360
county in which the district is located, the fact of such 361
receipt and the amounts so received. 362
(2) If the claim of a nonrepresented taxing district is 363
not paid directly to the treasurer of the district but is 364
included with payments for the remainder of the county, cash 365
payments included in the initial settlement shall be distributed 366
as provided in divisions (B) and (D) of this section. Any notes 367
received as payment shall be exchanged and distributed to 368
nonrepresented taxing districts upon receipt. 369
