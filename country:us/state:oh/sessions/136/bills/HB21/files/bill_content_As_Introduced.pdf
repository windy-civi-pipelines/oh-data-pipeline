States department of the treasury regulations. The deduction 350
otherwise allowed under division (A)(11)(a) of this section 351

gross income for any taxable year to the extent that the amount 356
is attributable to the recovery during the taxable year of any 357
amount deducted or excluded in computing federal or Ohio 358
adjusted gross income in any taxable year. 359
(12) Deduct any portion of the deduction described in 360

included in the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for a prior 365
taxable year and did not qualify for a credit under division (A) 366
or (B) of section 5747.05 of the Revised Code for that year; 367

net investment earnings of, a medical savings account during the 371
taxable year, in accordance with section 3924.66 of the Revised 372

taxable year from the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income. 376
(14)(a) Add an amount equal to the funds withdrawn from a 377
medical savings account during the taxable year, and the net 378
investment earnings on those funds, when the funds withdrawn 379
were used for any purpose other than to reimburse an account 380
holder for, or to pay, eligible medical expenses, in accordance 381
with section 3924.66 of the Revised Code; 382
(b) Add the amounts distributed from a medical savings 383
account under division (A)(2) of section 3924.68 of the Revised 384
Code during the taxable year. 385

5747.059 of the Revised Code to the extent that such amount 387
satisfies either of the following: 388
(a) The amount was deducted or excluded from the 389
computation of the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income as 390
required to be reported for the taxpayer's taxable year under 391
the Internal Revenue Code; 392

federal adjusted gross income as required to be reported for any 394
of the taxpayer's taxable years under the Internal Revenue Code. 395

convincing evidence, complete information about the location and 1283
cost of the physical assets of the lower pass-through entity is 1284

constitutes a qualifying trust amount, the upper level pass- 1287
through entity shall be deemed as owning no equity of the lower 1288
level pass-through entity for each day during the upper level 1289
pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year in which or with 1290
