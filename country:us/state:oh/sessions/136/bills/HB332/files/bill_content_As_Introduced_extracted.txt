Revised Code. 359
(B) The shares and share accounts of the credit union may 360
be of one or more classes, as designated by the board of 361
directors, subject to approval of the superintendent of credit 362
unions based on rules that shall assure equitable distribution 363
of dividends among classes, considering costs and advantages of 364
each class to the members of the credit union, including without 365
limitation special services rendered, length of ownership, 366
minimum investment, conditions of repurchase, and other 367

As Introduced
appropriate standards or combinations thereof. In the event the 368
articles of incorporation of the credit union indicate the 369
authorized number of shares to be unlimited, the designation of 370
classification of shares and share accounts of the credit union 371
may be effected by the board of directors, subject to the 372
approval of the superintendent, and does not require amendment 373
of the articles of incorporation. All shares of the credit union 374
shall have a par value per share as set by the board of 375
directors. Redemptions and liquidating dividends shall be 376
prorated to each member on the basis of the price paid the 377
credit union for such share, irrespective of the class of such 378
shares. 379
(C)(1) Each credit union shall have one class of shares 380
designated as "membership share." The membership shares, or if a 381
credit union has but one class of shares, then all of the shares 382
of the credit union, shall have a par value as set by the board 383
of directors. 384
(2) Two or more persons that are eligible for membership 385
that have jointly subscribed for one or more shares under a 386
joint account each may be admitted to membership. 387
(D) A credit union need not issue certificates for any or 388
all of its classes of shares but irrespective of whether 389
certificates are issued, a registry of shares must be kept, 390
including all of the transactions of the credit union pertaining 391
to such shares. 392
(E) A credit union is authorized to maintain share draft 393
accounts in accordance with rules prescribed by the 394
superintendent. The credit union may pay dividends on share 395
draft accounts, may pay dividends at different rates on 396
different types of share draft accounts, and may permit the 397

As Introduced
owners of such share draft accounts to make withdrawals by 398
negotiable or transferable instruments or other orders for the 399
purpose of making transfers to third parties. 400
(F) Unless otherwise provided by written agreement of the 401
parties, the rights, responsibilities, and liabilities attaching 402
to a share draft withdrawn from, transferred to, or otherwise 403
handled by a credit union are defined in and governed by 404
Chapters 1303. and 1304. of the Revised Code, as if the credit 405
union were a bank. 406
(G) Unless otherwise provided in the articles or 407
regulations, a member may designate any person or persons to own 408
or hold shares, or share accounts with the member in joint 409
tenancy with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common. 410
(H) Shares or share accounts may be issued in the name of 411
a custodian under the Ohio transfers to minors act, a member in 412
trust for a beneficiary, a fiduciary or custodian in trust for a 413
member beneficiary, or a fiduciary or custodian in trust upon 414
the death of a member. Redemption of such shares or payment of 415
such share accounts to a member, to the extent of the payment, 416
discharges the liability of the credit union to the member and 417
the beneficiary, and the credit union shall be under no 418
obligation to see to the application of the payment. Unless 419
prior to the death of a member, the member has notified the 420
credit union in writing in a form approved by the credit union 421
of a different beneficiary to receive the proceeds of such 422
shares or share accounts, then the proceeds shall be paid to the 423
beneficiary or to the beneficiary's parent or legal 424
representative. Any payment made pursuant to written 425
instructions of the member or pursuant to the provisions herein 426
contained shall be a valid and sufficient release and discharge 427

of the credit union in connection with any such share or share 428
accounts. 429
(I)(1) Except as otherwise provided in the articles or 430
regulations, and subject to the provisions thereof, a minor may 431
purchase shares, share accounts, or other depository 432
instruments, and except for qualification as a voting member, 433
the credit union may deal with the minor with respect to shares, 434
share accounts, or other depository instruments owned by the 435
minor as if the minor were a person of legal age. 436
(2) If shares, share accounts, or other depository 437
instruments are issued in the name of a minor, redemption of any 438
part or all of the shares or withdrawal of funds by payment to 439
the minor of the shares or funds and any declared dividends or 440
interest releases the credit union from all obligation to the 441
minor as to the shares reduced or funds withdrawn. 442
(J) The regulations may require advance written notice of 443
a member's intention to withdraw the member's shares. Such 444
advance notice shall not exceed sixty days. 445
(K) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, 446
funds deposited in a share account, share certificate, or in any 447
other manner pursuant to a program offered by a credit union to 448
promote consumer savings do not constitute valuable 449
consideration for purposes of a scheme of chance under Chapter 450
2915. of the Revised Code. 451
Section 2. That existing sections 135.61, 135.62, 135.621, 452
135.623, 1733.04, and 1733.24 of the Revised Code are hereby 453
repealed. 454
