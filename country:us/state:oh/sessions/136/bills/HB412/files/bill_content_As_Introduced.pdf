Representative Swearingen
To amend sections 309.09 and 733.48 of the Revised 1
Code to allow a village to contract with the 2
county prosecutor for legal services. 3
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF OHIO:
Section 1. That sections 309.09 and 733.48 of the Revised 4
Code be amended to read as follows: 5
Sec. 309.09. (A) The prosecuting attorney shall be the 6
legal adviser of the board of county commissioners, board of 7
elections, all other county officers and boards, and all tax- 8
supported public libraries, and any of them may require written 9
opinions or instructions from the prosecuting attorney in 10
matters connected with their official duties. The prosecuting 11
attorney shall prosecute and defend all suits and actions that 12
any such officer, board, or tax-supported public library directs 13
or to which it is a party, and no county officer may employ any 14
other counsel or attorney at the expense of the county, except 15
as provided in section 305.14 of the Revised Code. 16
(B)(1) The prosecuting attorney shall be the legal adviser 17
for all township officers, boards, and commissions, unless, 18
subject to division (B)(2) of this section, the township has 19
adopted a limited home rule government pursuant to Chapter 504. 20

H. B. No. 412 Page 2

of the Revised Code and has not entered into a contract to have 21
the prosecuting attorney serve as the township law director, in 22
which case, subject to division (B)(2) of this section, the 23
township law director, whether serving full-time or part-time, 24
shall be the legal adviser for all township officers, boards, 25
and commissions. When the board of township trustees finds it 26
advisable or necessary to have additional legal counsel, it may 27
employ an attorney other than the township law director or the 28
prosecuting attorney of the county, either for a particular 29
matter or on an annual basis, to represent the township and its 30
officers, boards, and commissions in their official capacities 31
and to advise them on legal matters. No such legal counsel may 32
be employed, except on the order of the board of township 33
trustees, duly entered upon its journal, in which the 34
compensation to be paid for the legal services shall be fixed. 35
The compensation shall be paid from the township fund. 36
Nothing in this division confers any of the powers or 37
duties of a prosecuting attorney under section 309.08 of the 38
Revised Code upon a township law director. 39
(2)(a) If any township in the county served by the 40
prosecuting attorney has adopted any resolution regarding the 41
operation of adult entertainment establishments pursuant to the 42
authority that is granted under section 503.52 of the Revised 43
Code, or if a resolution of that nature has been adopted under 44
section 503.53 of the Revised Code in a township in the county 45
served by the prosecuting attorney, all of the following apply: 46
(i) Upon the request of a township in the county that has 47
adopted, or in which has been adopted, a resolution of that 48
nature that is made pursuant to division (E)(1)(c) of section 49
503.52 of the Revised Code, the prosecuting attorney shall 50

H. B. No. 412 Page 3
As Introduced
prosecute and defend on behalf of the township in the trial and 51
argument in any court or tribunal of any challenge to the 52
validity of the resolution. If the challenge to the validity of 53
the resolution is before a federal court, the prosecuting 54
attorney may request the attorney general to assist the 55
prosecuting attorney in prosecuting and defending the challenge 56
and, upon the prosecuting attorney's making of such a request, 57
the attorney general shall assist the prosecuting attorney in 58
performing that service if the resolution was drafted in 59
accordance with legal guidance provided by the attorney general 60
as described in division (B)(2) of section 503.52 of the Revised 61
Code. The attorney general shall provide this assistance without 62
charge to the township for which the service is performed. If a 63
township adopts a resolution without the legal guidance of the 64
attorney general, the attorney general is not required to 65
provide assistance as described in this division to a 66
prosecuting attorney. 67
(ii) Upon the request of a township in the county that has 68
adopted, or in which has been adopted, a resolution of that 69
nature that is made pursuant to division (E)(1)(a) of section 70
503.52 of the Revised Code, the prosecuting attorney shall 71
prosecute and defend on behalf of the township a civil action to 72
enjoin the violation of the resolution in question. 73
(iii) Upon the request of a township in the county that 74
has adopted, or in which has been adopted, a resolution of that 75
nature that is made pursuant to division (E)(1)(b) of section 76
503.52 of the Revised Code, the prosecuting attorney shall 77
prosecute and defend on behalf of the township a civil action 78
under Chapter 3767. of the Revised Code to abate as a nuisance 79
the place in the unincorporated area of the township at which 80
the resolution is being or has been violated. Proceeds from the 81

division (E)(1)(b) of section 503.52 of the Revised Code. 84
(b) Division (B)(2)(a) of this section applies regarding 85
all townships, including townships that have adopted a limited 86
home rule government pursuant to Chapter 504. of the Revised 87
Code, and regardless of whether a township that has so adopted a 88
limited home rule government has entered into a contract with 89
the prosecuting attorney as described in division (B) of section 90
504.15 of the Revised Code or has appointed a law director as 91
described in division (A) of that section. 92
The prosecuting attorney shall prosecute and defend in the 93
actions and proceedings described in division (B)(2)(a) of this 94
section without charge to the township for which the services 95
are performed. 96
(C) Whenever the board of county commissioners employs an 97
attorney other than the prosecuting attorney of the county, 98
without the authorization of the court of common pleas as 99
provided in section 305.14 of the Revised Code, either for a 100
particular matter or on an annual basis, to represent the board 101
in its official capacity and to advise it on legal matters, the 102
board shall enter upon its journal an order of the board in 103
which the compensation to be paid for the legal services shall 104
be fixed. The compensation shall be paid from the county general 105
fund. The total compensation paid, in any year, by the board for 106
legal services under this division shall not exceed the total 107
annual compensation of the prosecuting attorney for that county. 108
(D) The prosecuting attorney and the board of county 109
commissioners jointly may contract with a board of park 110
