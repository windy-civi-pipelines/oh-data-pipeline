to accumulate currently available resources for the following 444
purposes: 445
(1) To stabilize subdivision budgets against cyclical 446
changes in revenues and expenditures; 447
(2) Except as otherwise provided by this section, to 448

the account was established. 466
A reserve balance account established for the purpose 467
described in division (A)(1) of this section may be established 468
in the general fund or in one or more special funds for 469
operating purposes of the subdivision. The amount of money to be 470
reserved in such an account in any fiscal year shall not exceed 471
five per cent of the revenue credited in the preceding fiscal 472

during the preceding fiscal year from the fund in which the 476
account is established. Subject to division (F)(G) of section 477
5705.29 of the Revised Code, any reserve balance in an account 478
established under division (A)(1) of this section shall not be 479
considered part of the unencumbered balance or revenue of the 480
subdivision under division (A) of section 5705.35 or division 481
(A)(1) of section 5705.36 of the Revised Code. 482
At any time, a taxing authority of a subdivision, by 483
resolution or ordinance, may reduce or eliminate the reserve 484
balance in a reserve balance account established for the purpose 485
described in division (A)(1) of this section. 486
A reserve balance account established for the purpose 487
described in division (A)(2) or (3) of this section shall be 488
established in the general fund of the subdivision or by the 489
establishment of a separate internal service fund established to 490
account for the operation of an individual or joint self- 491
insurance program described in division (A)(2) of this section 492

(A)(3) of this section, and shall be based on sound actuarial 494
principles. The total amount of money in a reserve balance 495
account for self-insurance may be expressed in dollars or as the 496
amount determined to represent an adequate reserve according to 497
sound actuarial principles. 498
A taxing authority of a subdivision, by resolution or 499
ordinance, may rescind a reserve balance account established 500

to the fund or funds from which the money originally was 503
transferred. 504

of accumulating resources for the payment of accumulated sick 507
leave and vacation leave, and for payments in lieu of taking 508
compensatory time off, upon the termination of employment or the 509
retirement of officers and employees of the subdivision. The 510
special revenue fund may also accumulate resources for payment 511
of salaries during any fiscal year when the number of pay 512
periods exceeds the usual and customary number of pay periods. 513
Notwithstanding sections 5705.14, 5705.15, and 5705.16 of the 514
Revised Code, the taxing authority, by resolution or ordinance, 515
may transfer money to the special revenue fund from any other 516
fund of the subdivision from which such payments may lawfully be 517
made. The taxing authority, by resolution or ordinance, may 518
rescind a special revenue fund established under this division. 519
If a special revenue fund is rescinded, money that has 520
accumulated in the fund shall be transferred to the fund or 521
funds from which the money originally was transferred. 522

(C) A taxing authority of a subdivision, by resolution or 523
ordinance, may establish a capital projects fund for the purpose 524
of accumulating resources for the acquisition, construction, or 525
improvement of fixed assets of the subdivision. For the purposes 526
of this section, "fixed assets" includes motor vehicles. More 527
than one capital projects fund may be established and may exist 528
at any time. The ordinance or resolution shall identify the 529
source of the money to be used to acquire, construct, or improve 530
the fixed assets identified in the resolution or ordinance, the 531
amount of money to be accumulated for that purpose, the period 532
of time over which that amount is to be accumulated, and the 533
fixed assets that the taxing authority intends to acquire, 534
construct, or improve with the money to be accumulated in the 535
fund. 536
A taxing authority of a subdivision shall not accumulate 537
money in a capital projects fund for more than ten years after 538
the resolution or ordinance establishing the fund is adopted. If 539
the subdivision has not entered into a contract for the 540
acquisition, construction, or improvement of fixed assets for 541
which money was accumulated in such a fund before the end of 542
that ten-year period, the fiscal officer of the subdivision 543
shall transfer all money in the fund to the fund or funds from 544
which that money originally was transferred or the fund that 545
originally was intended to receive the money. 546
A taxing authority of a subdivision, by resolution or 547
ordinance, may rescind a capital projects fund. If a capital 548
projects fund is rescinded, money that has accumulated in the 549
fund shall be transferred to the fund or funds from which the 550
money originally was transferred. 551

the Revised Code, the taxing authority of a subdivision, by 553
resolution or ordinance, may transfer money to the capital 554
projects fund from any other fund of the subdivision that may 555
lawfully be used for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, or 556
improving the fixed assets identified in the resolution or 557

auditor's tax list for the current year; provided that if the 623
auditor's tax list has not been completed, the auditor shall 624
estimate, as nearly as practicable, the amount of the taxable 625
property for such year, and such officers shall be governed by 626
such estimate. 627

to the succeeding fiscal year unless the subdivision or taxing 887
unit expressly states that the request is permanent. 888
(B) All levies for unsatisfied debt charges not provided 889
for by levies in excess of the ten-mill limitation, including 890
levies that remain necessary to pay notes issued for emergency 891
purposes; 892
(C) The levies prescribed by division (B) of sections 893
742.33 and 742.34 of the Revised Code; 894
(D) Except as otherwise provided in this division, a 895
minimum levy within the ten-mill limitation for the current 896
expense and debt service of each subdivision or taxing unit, 897
which shall equal two-thirds of the average levy for current 898
expenses and debt service allotted within the fifteen-mill 899
limitation to such subdivision or taxing unit during the last 900
five years the fifteen-mill limitation was in effect unless such 901
subdivision or taxing unit requests an amount requiring a lower 902
rate. Except for the succeeding fiscal year, or if it expressed 903
its intent to forgo collections from such a levy under division 904
(E) of section 5705.26 of the Revised Code. Such a request for 905
an amount requiring a lower rate applies only to the succeeding 906
fiscal year unless the subdivision or taxing unit expressly 907
states that the request is permanent. 908
Except as provided in section 5705.312 of the Revised 909
Code, if the levies required in divisions (B) and (C) of this 910

H. B. No. 309 Page 32
As Introduced
levies of the other subdivisions or taxing units shall be 913
reduced by the commission to provide for the levies and an 914
operating levy for the subdivision. Such additional levy shall 915
be deducted from the minimum levies of each of the other 916
subdivisions or taxing units, but the operating levy for a 917
school district shall not be reduced below a figure equivalent 918
to forty-five per cent of the millage available within the ten- 919
mill limitation after all the levies in divisions (B) and (C) of 920
this section have been provided for. 921
If a municipal corporation and a township have entered 922
into an annexation agreement under section 709.192 of the 923
Revised Code in which they agree to reallocate their shares of 924
the minimum levies established under this division and if that 925
annexation agreement is submitted along with the annual tax 926
budget of both the township and the municipal corporation, then, 927
when determining the minimum levy under this division, the 928
auditor shall allocate, to the extent possible, the minimum levy 929
for that municipal corporation and township in accordance with 930
their annexation agreement. 931
(E) The levies prescribed by section 3709.29 of the 932
Revised Code. 933
Divisions (A) to (E)(D) of this section are mandatory, and 934
commissions shall be without discretion to reduce such minimum 935
levies except as provided in such divisions. 936
If any debt charge is omitted from the budget, the 937
commission shall include it therein. 938
Sec. 5705.32. (A) As used in this section, "fixed-sum 939
levy" means a tax levied on property at whatever rate is 940
required to produce a specified amount of tax money or levied in 941

H. B. No. 309 Page 33

excess of the ten-mill limitation to pay debt charges, including 942
a tax levied under section 5705.199 of the Revised Code. 943
(B) The county budget commission shall adjust the 944
estimated amounts required from the general property tax for 945
each fund, as shown by the tax budgets or other information 946
required to be provided under section 5705.281 of the Revised 947
Code, so as to bring the tax levies required therefor within the 948
limitations specified in sections 5705.01 to 5705.47 of the 949
Revised Code, for such levies, but no levy shall be reduced 950
pursuant to this division below a minimum fixed by law. The 951
commission may revise and adjust the estimate of balances and 952
receipts from all sources for each fund and shall determine the 953
total appropriations that may be made therefrom. 954
The county budget commission shall adjust the rate of a 955
fixed-sum levy such as is necessary for the levy to produce the 956
levy's specified amount of money for the tax year. 957
If a taxing unit declared its intent to forgo collections 958
under division (E) of section 5705.29 of the Revised Code, the 959
commission shall adjust the rate of each levy as required to 960
result in that reduction in collections. 961
(C) If, as shown by a tax budget or other information 962
required pursuant to section 5705.281 of the Revised Code, the 963
unencumbered balance estimated to remain in any fund at the end 964
of the current fiscal year exceeds thirty per cent of the total 965
estimated expenses from that fund through the end of the current 966
fiscal year, the county budget commission shall hold a public 967
hearing to consider adjustments to any tax levies, the receipts 968
of which are deposited into the fund. 969
The hearing shall be held to determine whether those 970

H. B. No. 309 Page 34
As Introduced
levies should be adjusted for the succeeding fiscal year to 971
avoid excessive collections. The taxing authority for whose 972
benefit the tax is levied shall be given the opportunity, at the 973
public hearing, to present its position as to whether the levy 974
should be adjusted and to provide evidence supporting that 975
position. 976
If, after the public hearing, the commission determines 977
that one or more levies should be adjusted to avoid excessive 978
collections, the commission may reduce the levy for the 979
following fiscal year by an amount, or a rate the results in an 980
amount, that is up to or equal to the amount by which the 981
estimated fiscal-year-end unencumbered balance in the fund 982
exceeds thirty per cent of the estimated fiscal-year-end 983
expenditures from the fund. But, no levy may be reduced to a 984
level that would cause a school district subject to division (A) 985
of section 3317.01 of the Revised Code to levy less than twenty 986
mills for current operating expenses as required by that 987
division, except as authorized in division (B) of this section 988
or division (D) of section 5705.31 of the Revised Code. 989
(B)(D) The commission shall fix the amount of the county 990
public library fund to be distributed to each board of public 991
library trustees that has qualified under section 5705.28 of the 992
Revised Code for participation in the proceeds of such fund. The 993
amount paid to all libraries in the county from such fund shall 994
never be a smaller per cent of the fund than the average of the 995
percentages of the county's classified taxes that were 996
distributed to libraries in 1982, 1983, and 1984, as determined 997
by the county auditor. The commission shall base the amount for 998
distribution on the needs of such library for the construction 999
of new library buildings, parts of buildings, improvements, 1000
operation, maintenance, or other expenses. In determining the 1001

H. B. No. 309 Page 35
As Introduced
needs of each library board of trustees, and in calculating the 1002
amount to be distributed to any library board of trustees on the 1003
basis of its needs, the commission shall make no reduction in 1004
its allocation from the fund on account of additional revenues 1005
realized by a library from increased taxes or service charges 1006
voted by its electorate, from revenues received through federal 1007
or state grants, projects, or programs, or from grants from 1008
private sources. 1009
(C)(E) Notwithstanding the fact that alternative methods 1010
of financing such needs are available, after fixing the amount 1011
to be distributed to libraries, the commission shall fix the 1012
amount, if any, of the county public library fund to be 1013
distributed to each board of township park commissioners, the 1014
county, and each municipal corporation in accordance with the 1015
following: 1016
(1) Each municipal corporation in the county shall receive 1017
a per cent of the remainder that equals the per cent that the 1018
county auditor determines the classified property taxes 1019
originating in such municipal corporation in 1984 were of the 1020
total of all of the county's classified property taxes in 1984. 1021
The commission may deduct from this amount any amount that the 1022
budget commission allows to the board of township park 1023
commissioners of a township park district, the boundaries of 1024
which are coextensive with or contained within the boundaries of 1025
the municipal corporation. 1026
(2) The county shall receive a per cent of the remainder 1027
that equals the per cent that the county auditor determines the 1028
classified property taxes originating outside of the boundaries 1029
of municipal corporations in the county in 1984 were of the 1030
total of all of the county's classified property taxes in 1984. 1031

The commission may deduct from this amount any amount that the 1032
budget commission allows to the board of township park 1033
commissioners of a township park district, the boundaries of 1034
which are not coextensive with or contained within those of any 1035
municipal corporation in the county. 1036
(D)(F) The commission shall separately set forth the 1037
amounts fixed and determined under divisions (B)(D) and (C)(E) 1038
of this section in the "official certificate of estimated 1039
resources," as provided in section 5705.35 of the Revised Code, 1040
and separately certify such amount to the county auditor who 1041
shall be guided thereby in the distribution of the county public 1042
library fund for and during the fiscal year. In determining such 1043
amounts, the commission shall be guided by the estimate 1044
certified by the tax commissioner and presented by the auditor 1045
under section 5705.31 of the Revised Code, as to the total 1046
amount of revenue to be received in the county public library 1047
fund during such fiscal year. 1048
(E)(1)(G)(1) At least five days before the date of any 1049
meeting at which the budget commission plans to discuss the 1050
distribution of the county public library fund, it shall notify 1051
each legislative authority and board of public library trustees, 1052
county commissioners, and township park commissioners eligible 1053
to participate in the distribution of the fund of the date, 1054
time, place, and agenda for the meeting. Any legislative 1055
authority or board entitled to notice under this division may 1056
designate an officer or employee of such legislative authority 1057
or board to whom the commission shall deliver the notice. 1058
(2) Before the final determination of the amount to be 1059
allotted to each subdivision from any source, the commission 1060
shall permit representatives of each subdivision and of each 1061

board of public library trustees to appear before it to explain 1062
its financial needs. 1063
(F)(H) If any public library receives and expends any 1064
funds allocated to it under this section for the construction of 1065
new library buildings or parts of buildings, such library shall 1066
be free and open to the inhabitants of the county in which it is 1067
located. Any board of library trustees that receives funds under 1068
this section and section 5747.48 of the Revised Code shall have 1069
its financial records open for public inspection at all 1070
reasonable times. 1071

(1) "City, located wholly or partially in the county, with 1073
the greatest population" means the city, located wholly or 1074
partially in the county, with the greatest population residing 1075
in the county; however, if the county budget commission on or 1076
before January 1, 1998, adopted an alternative method of 1077
apportionment that was approved by the city, located partially 1078
in the county, with the greatest population but not the greatest 1079
population residing in the county, "city, located wholly or 1080
partially in the county, with the greatest population" means the 1081
city, located wholly or partially in the county, with the 1082
greatest population whether residing in the county or not, if 1083
this alternative meaning is adopted by action of the board of 1084
county commissioners and a majority of the boards of township 1085
trustees and legislative authorities of municipal corporations 1086
located wholly or partially in the county. 1087

the current calendar year. 1096
(B) In lieu of the method of apportionment of the county 1097
public library fund provided by division (C)(E) of section 1098
5705.32 of the Revised Code, the county budget commission may 1099
provide for the apportionment of the fund under an alternative 1100

first been approved by all of the following governmental units: 1104
the board of county commissioners; the legislative authority of 1105
the city, located wholly or partially in the county, with the 1106
greatest population; and a majority of the boards or legislative 1107
authorities of township trustees and legislative authorities of 1108
municipal corporations, located wholly or partially in the 1109
county, excluding the legislative authority of the city, located 1110
wholly or partially in the county, with the greatest 1111
populationany subdivision for which the county budget commission 1112
has fixed an allocation from public library fund moneys under 1113

approval for an alternative method of apportionment, the board 1115
of county commissioners, boards of township trustees, and 1116
legislative authorities of municipal corporations subdivisions 1117

If an alternative method of apportionment adopted and approved 1126
under this division is repealed, the county public library fund 1127
shall be apportioned among the subdivisions eligible to 1128
participate in the fund, commencing in the ensuing calendar 1129
year, under the apportionment provided in divisions (B)(D) and 1130
(C)(E) of section 5705.32 of the Revised Code, unless the repeal 1131

participating political subdivisions, which together have a 1141
population residing in the county that is a majority of the 1142
total population of the county, each may adopt a resolution to 1143
exclude the approval otherwise required of the legislative 1144
authority of the city, located wholly or partially in the 1145
county, with the greatest population. All of the resolutions to 1146
exclude that approval shall be adopted not later than the first 1147
Monday of August of the year preceding the calendar year in 1148

year. An alternative method of apportionment under this division 1167
shall not be revised or amended after the first Monday of August 1168
of the year preceding the calendar year in which distributions 1169
are to be made under it. 1170

section, as certified by the auditor to the county treasurer, 1178
the county treasurer shall make distribution of the money in the 1179

treasury of a subdivision from the county public library fund in 1186
a county treasury shall be paid into the general fund and used 1187
for the current operating expenses of the subdivision. 1188
(F)(D) The actions of the county budget commission taken 1189
pursuant to this section are final and may not be appealed to 1190

As Introduced
the Revised Code and any additions to principal arising from 1213
sources other than the reinvestment of investment earnings 1214
arising from that fund, are not unencumbered balances for the 1215
purposes of this section. The balance in a reserve balance 1216
account established under section 5705.132 of the Revised Code 1217
is not an unencumbered balance for the purposes of this 1218
division. 1219
There shall be attached to the certification a summary, 1220
which shall be known as the "official certificate of estimated 1221
resources," that shall state the total estimated resources of 1222
each fund of the subdivision that are available for 1223
appropriation in the fiscal year, other than funds to be created 1224
by transfer, and a statement of the amount of the total tax 1225
duplicate of the school district to be used in the collection of 1226

taxing unit shall revise its tax budget, if one was adopted, so 1229
that the total contemplated expenditures from any fund during 1230
the ensuing fiscal year will not exceed the total appropriations 1231
that may be made from such fund, as determined by the budget 1232
commission in its certification; and such revised budget shall 1233
be the basis of the annual appropriation measure. 1234
(B) Revenue from real property taxes scheduled to be 1235
settled on or before the tenth day of August and the fifteenth 1236
day of February of a fiscal year under divisions (A) and (C) of 1237
section 321.24 of the Revised Code shall not be available for 1238

they are paid to the treasurer under such section. If the date 1244
for any settlement of taxes is extended under division (E) of 1245
section 321.24 of the Revised Code, the latest date set forth in 1246
divisions (A) to (D) of that section shall be used to determine 1247
in which fiscal year the revenues are first available for 1248
appropriation. 1249
Sec. 5705.36. (A)(1) On or about the first day of each 1250
fiscal year, the fiscal officer of each subdivision and other 1251
taxing unit shall certify to the county auditor the total amount 1252

the balances and revenues to be derived from taxation and other 1276
sources, shall revise its estimate of the amounts that will be 1277
credited to each fund from such sources, and shall certify to 1278
the taxing authority of each subdivision an amended official 1279
certificate of estimated resources. 1280
(2) Subject to divisions (A)(3) and (4) of this section, 1281
upon a determination by the fiscal officer of a subdivision that 1282
the revenue to be collected by the subdivision will be greater 1283
or less than the amount included in an official certificate, the 1284
fiscal officer may certify the amount of the deficiency or 1285
excess to the commission, and if the commission determines that 1286
the fiscal officer's certification is reasonable, the commission 1287
shall certify an amended official certificate reflecting the 1288
deficiency or excess. 1289
(3) Upon a determination by the fiscal officer of a 1290
subdivision that the revenue to be collected by the subdivision 1291
will be greater than the amount included in an official 1292
certificate and the legislative authority intends to appropriate 1293
and expend the excess revenue, the fiscal officer shall certify 1294
the amount of the excess to the commission, and if the 1295
commission determines that the fiscal officer's certification is 1296
reasonable, the commission shall certify an amended official 1297
certificate reflecting the excess. 1298
(4) Upon a determination by the fiscal officer of a 1299
subdivision that the revenue to be collected by the subdivision 1300
will be less than the amount included in an official certificate 1301
and that the amount of the deficiency will reduce available 1302

certificate reflecting the deficiency. 1306
(5) The total appropriations made during the fiscal year 1307
from any fund shall not exceed the amount set forth as available 1308
for expenditure from such fund in the official certificate of 1309
estimated resources, or any amendment thereof, certified prior 1310
to the making of the appropriation or supplemental 1311
appropriation. 1312
(B) At the time of settlement of taxes against which notes 1313
have been issued under division (D) of section 133.10 of the 1314
Revised Code and at the time a tax duplicate is delivered 1315
pursuant to section 319.28 or 319.29 of the Revised Code, the 1316
county auditor shall determine whether the total amount to be 1317

duplicate, when combined with the amounts to be distributed from 1319
any subsequent settlement, will increase or decrease the amount 1320
available for appropriation during the current fiscal year from 1321
any fund. The county auditor shall certify this finding to the 1322
budget commission, which shall certify an amended official 1323

district that no amended certificate needs to be issued. 1325
Sec. 5705.37. The taxing authority of any subdivision, or 1326
the board of trustees of any public library, nonprofit 1327
corporation, or library association maintaining a free public 1328
library that has adopted and certified rules under section 1329

action of the county budget commission may, through its fiscal 1331
officer, appeal to the board of tax appeals within thirty days 1332

after the receipt by the subdivision of the official certificate 1333
or notice of the commission's action. In like manner, but 1334
through its clerk, any park district may appeal to the board of 1335
tax appeals. An appeal under this section shall be taken by the 1336
filing of a notice of appeal, either in person or by certified 1337
mail, express mail, or authorized delivery service as provided 1338
in section 5703.056 of the Revised Code, with the board and with 1339
the commission. If notice of appeal is filed by certified mail, 1340
express mail, or authorized delivery service, date of the United 1341
States postmark placed on the sender's receipt by the postal 1342
service or the date of receipt recorded by the authorized 1343
delivery service shall be treated as the date of filing. Upon 1344
receipt of the notice of appeal, the commission, by certified 1345
mail, shall notify all persons who were parties to the 1346
proceeding before the commission of the filing of the notice of 1347
appeal and shall file proof of notice with the board of tax 1348
appeals. The secretary of the commission shall forthwith certify 1349
to the board a transcript of the full and accurate record of all 1350
proceedings before the commission, together with all evidence 1351
presented in the proceedings or considered by the commission, 1352
pertaining to the action from which the appeal is taken. The 1353
secretary of the commission also shall certify to the board any 1354
additional information that the board may request. 1355
The board of tax appeals, in a de novo proceeding, shall 1356
forthwith consider the matter presented to the commission, and 1357
may modify any action of the commission with reference to the 1358
budget, the estimate of revenues and balances, the allocation of 1359
the public library fund, or the fixing of tax rates. The If the 1360
appeal is taken in response to the fixing of tax rates through a 1361
reduction made by the county budget commission, the burden of 1362
proof is on the appellant to show the need for a different rate 1363

or amount to meet expenses in the ensuing fiscal year and the 1364
board of tax appeals shall render its decision in the same 1365
calendar year the appeal is filed. 1366
The finding of the board of tax appeals shall be 1367
substituted for the findings of the commission, and shall be 1368
sent to the tax commissioner, the county auditor, and the taxing 1369
authority of the subdivision affected, or to the board of public 1370
library trustees affected, as the action of the commission under 1371
sections 5705.01 to 5705.47 of the Revised Code. At the request 1372
of the taxing authority, board of trustees, or park district 1373
that appealed an action of the county budget commission under 1374
this section, the findings of the board of tax appeals shall be 1375
sent by certified mail at the requestor's expense. 1376
This section does not give the board of tax appeals any 1377
authority to place any tax levy authorized by law within the 1378
ten-mill limitation outside of that limitation, or to reduce any 1379
levy below any minimum fixed by law. 1380
Sec. 5747.51. (A) On or before the twenty-fifth day of 1381
July of each year, the tax commissioner shall make and certify 1382
to the county auditor of each county an estimate of the amount 1383
of the local government fund to be allocated to the undivided 1384
local government fund of each county for the ensuing calendar 1385
year, adjusting the total as required to account for 1386
subdivisions receiving local government funds under section 1387
5747.502 of the Revised Code. 1388
(B) At each annual regular session of the county budget 1389
commission convened pursuant to section 5705.27 of the Revised 1390
Code, each auditor shall present to the commission the 1391
certificate of the commissioner, the annual tax budget and 1392
estimates, and the records showing the action of the commission 1393

H. B. No. 309 Page 48
As Introduced
in its last preceding regular session. The commission, after 1394
extending to the representatives of each subdivision an 1395
opportunity to be heard, under oath administered by any member 1396
of the commission, and considering all the facts and information 1397
presented to it by the auditor, shall determine the amount of 1398
the undivided local government fund needed by and to be 1399
apportioned to each subdivision for current operating expenses, 1400
as shown in the tax budget of the subdivision. This 1401
determination shall be made pursuant to divisions (C) to (I) of 1402
this section, unless the commission has provided for a formula 1403
pursuant to section 5747.53 of the Revised Code. The 1404
commissioner shall reduce the amount of funds from the undivided 1405
local government fund to a subdivision required to receive 1406
reduced funds under section 5747.502 of the Revised Code. 1407
Nothing in this section prevents the budget commission, 1408
for the purpose of apportioning the undivided local government 1409
fund, from inquiring into the claimed needs of any subdivision 1410
as stated in its tax budget, or from adjusting claimed needs to 1411
reflect actual needs. For the purposes of this section, "current 1412
operating expenses" means the lawful expenditures of a 1413
subdivision, except those for permanent improvements and except 1414
payments for interest, sinking fund, and retirement of bonds, 1415
notes, and certificates of indebtedness of the subdivision. 1416
(C) The commission shall determine the combined total of 1417
the estimated expenditures, including transfers, from the 1418
general fund and any special funds other than special funds 1419
established for road and bridge; street construction, 1420
maintenance, and repair; state highway improvement; and gas, 1421
water, sewer, and electric public utilities operated by a 1422
subdivision, as shown in the subdivision's tax budget for the 1423
ensuing calendar year. 1424

H. B. No. 309 Page 49
As Introduced
(D) From the combined total of expenditures calculated 1425
pursuant to division (C) of this section, the commission shall 1426
deduct the following expenditures, if included in these funds in 1427
the tax budget: 1428
(1) Expenditures for permanent improvements as defined in 1429
division (E) of section 5705.01 of the Revised Code; 1430
(2) In the case of counties and townships, transfers to 1431
the road and bridge fund, and in the case of municipalities, 1432
transfers to the street construction, maintenance, and repair 1433
fund and the state highway improvement fund; 1434
(3) Expenditures for the payment of debt charges; 1435
(4) Expenditures for the payment of judgments. 1436
(E) In addition to the deductions made pursuant to 1437
division (D) of this section, revenues accruing to the general 1438
fund and any special fund considered under division (C) of this 1439
section from the following sources shall be deducted from the 1440
combined total of expenditures calculated pursuant to division 1441
(C) of this section: 1442
(1) Taxes levied within the ten-mill limitation, as 1443
defined in section 5705.02 of the Revised Code; 1444
(2) The budget commission allocation of estimated county 1445
public library fund revenues to be distributed pursuant to 1446
section 5747.48 of the Revised Code; 1447
(3) Estimated unencumbered balances as shown on the tax 1448
budget as of the thirty-first day of December of the current 1449
year in the general fund, but not any estimated balance in any 1450
special fund considered in division (C) of this section; 1451
(4) Revenue, including transfers, shown in the general 1452

fund and any special funds other than special funds established 1453
for road and bridge; street construction, maintenance, and 1454
repair; state highway improvement; and gas, water, sewer, and 1455
electric public utilities, from all other sources except those 1456
that a subdivision receives from an additional tax or service 1457
charge voted by its electorate or receives from special 1458
assessment or revenue bond collection. For the purposes of this 1459
division, where the charter of a municipal corporation prohibits 1460
the levy of an income tax, an income tax levied by the 1461
legislative authority of such municipal corporation pursuant to 1462
an amendment of the charter of that municipal corporation to 1463
authorize such a levy represents an additional tax voted by the 1464
electorate of that municipal corporation. For the purposes of 1465
this division, any measure adopted by a board of county 1466
commissioners pursuant to section 322.02, 4504.02, or 5739.021 1467
of the Revised Code, including those measures upheld by the 1468
electorate in a referendum conducted pursuant to section 1469
322.021, 4504.021, or 5739.022 of the Revised Code, shall not be 1470
considered an additional tax voted by the electorate. 1471
Subject to division (F)(G) of section 5705.29 of the 1472
Revised Code, money in a reserve balance account established by 1473
a county, township, or municipal corporation under section 1474
5705.13 of the Revised Code shall not be considered an 1475
unencumbered balance or revenue under division (E)(3) or (4) of 1476
this section. Money in a reserve balance account established by 1477
a township under section 5705.132 of the Revised Code shall not 1478
be considered an unencumbered balance or revenue under division 1479
(E)(3) or (4) of this section. 1480
If a county, township, or municipal corporation has 1481
created and maintains a nonexpendable trust fund under section 1482
5705.131 of the Revised Code, the principal of the fund, and any 1483

H. B. No. 309 Page 51

additions to the principal arising from sources other than the 1484
reinvestment of investment earnings arising from such a fund, 1485
shall not be considered an unencumbered balance or revenue under 1486
division (E)(3) or (4) of this section. Only investment earnings 1487
arising from investment of the principal or investment of such 1488
additions to principal may be considered an unencumbered balance 1489
or revenue under those divisions. 1490
(F) The total expenditures calculated pursuant to division 1491
(C) of this section, less the deductions authorized in divisions 1492
(D) and (E) of this section, shall be known as the "relative 1493
need" of the subdivision, for the purposes of this section. 1494
(G) The budget commission shall total the relative need of 1495
all participating subdivisions in the county, and shall compute 1496
a relative need factor by dividing the total estimate of the 1497
undivided local government fund by the total relative need of 1498
all participating subdivisions. 1499
(H) The relative need of each subdivision shall be 1500
multiplied by the relative need factor to determine the 1501
proportionate share of the subdivision in the undivided local 1502
government fund of the county; provided, that the maximum 1503
proportionate share of a county shall not exceed the following 1504
maximum percentages of the total estimate of the undivided local 1505
government fund governed by the relationship of the percentage 1506
of the population of the county that resides within municipal 1507
corporations within the county to the total population of the 1508
county as reported in the reports on population in Ohio by the 1509
department of development as of the twentieth day of July of the 1510
year in which the tax budget is filed with the budget 1511

D Eighty-one per cent or more Thirty per cent
Where the proportionate share of the county exceeds the 1514
limitations established in this division, the budget commission 1515
shall adjust the proportionate shares determined pursuant to 1516
this division so that the proportionate share of the county does 1517
not exceed these limitations, and it shall increase the 1518
proportionate shares of all other subdivisions on a pro rata 1519
basis. In counties having a population of less than one hundred 1520
thousand, not less than ten per cent shall be distributed to the 1521
townships therein. 1522
(I) The proportionate share of each subdivision in the 1523
undivided local government fund determined pursuant to division 1524
(H) of this section for any calendar year shall not be less than 1525
the product of the average of the percentages of the undivided 1526
local government fund of the county as apportioned to that 1527
subdivision for the calendar years 1968, 1969, and 1970, 1528
multiplied by the total amount of the undivided local government 1529
fund of the county apportioned pursuant to former section 1530
5739.23 of the Revised Code for the calendar year 1970. For the 1531
purposes of this division, the total apportioned amount for the 1532
calendar year 1970 shall be the amount actually allocated to the 1533

county in 1970 from the state collected intangible tax as levied 1534
by section 5707.03 of the Revised Code and distributed pursuant 1535
to section 5725.24 of the Revised Code, plus the amount received 1536
by the county in the calendar year 1970 pursuant to division (B) 1537
(1) of former section 5739.21 of the Revised Code, and 1538
distributed pursuant to former section 5739.22 of the Revised 1539
Code. If the total amount of the undivided local government fund 1540
for any calendar year is less than the amount of the undivided 1541
local government fund apportioned pursuant to former section 1542
5739.23 of the Revised Code for the calendar year 1970, the 1543
minimum amount guaranteed to each subdivision for that calendar 1544
year pursuant to this division shall be reduced on a basis 1545
proportionate to the amount by which the amount of the undivided 1546
local government fund for that calendar year is less than the 1547
amount of the undivided local government fund apportioned for 1548
the calendar year 1970. 1549
(J) On the basis of such apportionment, the county auditor 1550
shall compute the percentage share of each such subdivision in 1551
the undivided local government fund and shall at the same time 1552
certify to the tax commissioner the percentage share of the 1553
county as a subdivision. No payment shall be made from the 1554
undivided local government fund, except in accordance with such 1555
percentage shares. 1556
Within ten days after the budget commission has made its 1557
apportionment, whether conducted pursuant to section 5747.51 or 1558
5747.53 of the Revised Code, the auditor shall publish a list of 1559
the subdivisions and the amount each is to receive from the 1560
undivided local government fund and the percentage share of each 1561
subdivision, in a newspaper or newspapers of countywide 1562
circulation, and send a copy of such allocation to the tax 1563
commissioner. 1564

The county auditor shall also send a copy of such 1565
allocation by ordinary or electronic mail to the fiscal officer 1566
of each subdivision entitled to participate in the allocation of 1567
the undivided local government fund of the county. This copy 1568

referred to in section 5705.37 of the Revised Code. 1570
All money received into the treasury of a subdivision from 1571
the undivided local government fund in a county treasury shall 1572
be paid into the general fund and used for the current operating 1573
expenses of the subdivision. 1574
If a municipal corporation maintains a municipal 1575
university, such municipal university, when the board of 1576
trustees so requests the legislative authority of the municipal 1577
corporation, shall participate in the money apportioned to such 1578
municipal corporation from the total local government fund, 1579
however created and constituted, in such amount as requested by 1580
the board of trustees, provided such sum does not exceed nine 1581
per cent of the total amount paid to the municipal corporation. 1582
If any public official fails to maintain the records 1583
required by sections 5747.50 to 5747.55 of the Revised Code or 1584
by the rules issued by the tax commissioner, the auditor of 1585
state, or the treasurer of state pursuant to such sections, or 1586
fails to comply with any law relating to the enforcement of such 1587
sections, the local government fund money allocated to the 1588
county may be withheld until such time as the public official 1589

the greatest population" means the city, located wholly or 1594
partially in the county, with the greatest population residing 1595
in the county; however, if the county budget commission on or 1596
before January 1, 1998, adopted an alternative method of 1597
apportionment that was approved by the legislative authority of 1598
the city, located partially in the county, with the greatest 1599
population but not the greatest population residing in the 1600
county, "city, located wholly or partially in the county, with 1601
the greatest population" means the city, located wholly or 1602
partially in the county, with the greatest population whether 1603
residing in the county or not, if this alternative meaning is 1604

majority of the boards of township trustees and legislative 1606
authorities of municipal corporations located wholly or 1607
partially in the county. 1608

(B) In lieu of the method of apportionment of the 1618
undivided local government fund of the county provided by 1619

Except as otherwise provided in division (C) of this 1627
section, the The alternative method of apportionment shall have 1628

trustees and legislative authorities of municipal corporations, 1633
located wholly or partially in the county, excluding the 1634
legislative authority of the city, located wholly or partially 1635
in the county, with the greatest population. In granting or 1636
denying approval for an alternative method of apportionment, the 1637
board of county commissioners, boards of township trustees, and 1638
legislative authorities of municipal corporations shall act by 1639
motion. A motion to approve shall be passed upon a majority vote 1640
of the members of a board of county commissioners, board of 1641
township trustees, or legislative authority of a municipal 1642
corporation, shall take effect immediately, and need not be 1643

approved under this division shall be reviewed by the county 1646
budget commission at a public hearing held at least once in the 1647
year following the effective date of this amendment 2024 and in 1648
every fifth year thereafter. The county budget commission shall 1649
provide reasonable advance notice of the hearing to all 1650
political subdivisions eligible to participate in the fund and 1651
shall take public testimony from any such political subdivision 1652
that wishes to testify. 1653

If an alternative method of apportionment adopted and approved 1657
under this division is repealed, the undivided local government 1658
fund of the county shall be apportioned among the subdivisions 1659
eligible to participate in the fund, commencing in the ensuing 1660
calendar year, under the apportionment provided in section 1661
5747.52 of the Revised Code, unless the repeal occurs by 1662
operation of division (C) of this section or a new method for 1663
apportionment of the fund is provided in the action of repeal. 1664
(C) This division applies only in counties in which the 1665
city, located wholly or partially in the county, with the 1666
greatest population has a population of twenty thousand or less 1667
and a population that is less than fifteen per cent of the total 1668
population of the county. In such a county, the legislative 1669
authorities or boards of township trustees of two or more 1670
participating political subdivisions, which together have a 1671
population residing in the county that is a majority of the 1672
total population of the county, each may adopt a resolution to 1673
exclude the approval otherwise required of the legislative 1674
authority of the city, located wholly or partially in the 1675
county, with the greatest population. All of the resolutions to 1676
exclude that approval shall be adopted not later than the first 1677
Monday of August of the year preceding the calendar year in 1678
which distributions are to be made under an alternative method 1679
of apportionment. 1680
A motion granting or denying approval of an alternative 1681

municipal corporations located wholly or partially in the 1686
county, other than the city, located wholly or partially in the 1687

immediately, and need not be published. The alternative method 1689
of apportionment under this division shall be adopted and 1690
approved annually, not later than the first Monday of August of 1691
the year preceding the calendar year in which distributions are 1692
to be made under it. A motion granting approval of an 1693
alternative method of apportionment under this division repeals 1694
any existing alternative method of apportionment, effective with 1695
distributions to be made from the fund in the ensuing calendar 1696
year. An alternative method of apportionment under this division 1697
shall not be revised or amended after the first Monday of August 1698
of the year preceding the calendar year in which distributions 1699
are to be made under it. 1700

those shares is in the custody of the treasurer in the amounts 1719
so computed to be due the respective subdivisions, shall at the 1720
same time certify to the tax commissioner the percentage share 1721
of the county as a subdivision. All money received into the 1722
treasury of a subdivision from the undivided local government 1723
fund in a county treasury shall be paid into the general fund 1724
and used for the current operating expenses of the subdivision. 1725
If a municipal corporation maintains a municipal university, the 1726
university, when the board of trustees so requests the 1727
legislative authority of the municipal corporation, shall 1728
participate in the money apportioned to the municipal 1729
corporation from the total local government fund, however 1730
created and constituted, in the amount requested by the board of 1731
trustees, provided that amount does not exceed nine per cent of 1732
