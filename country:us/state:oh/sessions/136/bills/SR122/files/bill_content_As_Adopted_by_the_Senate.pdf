Regular Session S. R. No. 122

Senator Brenner
A R E S O L U T I O N
Recognizing ALS Awareness Month, May 2025.
WHEREAS, The members of the Senate of the 136th General Assembly 1
of Ohio are pleased to recognize Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 2
Awareness Month, May 2025; and 3
WHEREAS, Formerly known as Lou Gehrigâ€™s Disease, amyotrophic 4
lateral sclerosis is a neurological disorder that affects motor 5
neurons, the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control 6
voluntary muscle movement and breathing, and as these neurons 7
degenerate and die, they stop sending messages to the muscles, which 8
then weaken, twitch, and atrophy. People with ALS gradually lose their 9
ability to initiate and control voluntary movements such as walking, 10
talking, and chewing, as well as breathing, and they eventually need 11
continuous care until they die from respiratory failure, usually 12
within five years of the onset of symptoms; and 13
WHEREAS, The causes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are unknown, 14
and there is presently no cure, although some treatments may slow its 15
progression. Research is critical to helping scientists and persons 16
living with ALS better understand the disease, and the National ALS 17
Registry works with patients, caregivers, researchers, healthcare 18
providers, neurologists, and supporters to collect and compile 19
information that may shed light on better treatments and eventually 20
lead to a cure; and 21
WHEREAS, May has been designated as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 22
Awareness Month to call attention to this disease and those affected 23
by it. Public understanding, support, and encouragement can go a long 24
way in improving the quality of life for victims, families, and 25
caregivers and bring hope for the future; therefore be it 26
