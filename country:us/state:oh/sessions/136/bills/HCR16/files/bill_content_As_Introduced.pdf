WHEREAS, The United States ranks as Taiwan's second-largest 20
trading partner; Taiwan is the seventh largest trading partner 21
of the United States, and bilateral trade reached more than 22
$158.6 billion USD in 2024; and 23
WHEREAS, The total agricultural trade between Taiwan and 24
the United States reached $4.67 billion. Taiwan imported nearly 25
$3.8 billion worth of United States farm products in 2024, 26
making it the largest market for United States agricultural 27
products overall, the fourth largest market on a per capita 28
basis among the top 10 United States agricultural export 29
destinations, and the seventh largest market for United States 30
soybeans and corn individually; and 31
WHEREAS, Due to its high quality produce, the United States 32
remains one of Taiwan's largest sources of agricultural 33
products, supplying more than one-fifth of the country's major 34
agricultural imports; and 35
WHEREAS, Taiwan and the State of Ohio have enjoyed a long 36
and mutually beneficial relationship with the prospect of future 37
growth, and Taiwan was Ohio's fourth-largest export market in 38
Asia in 2023, with $904.23 million worth of Ohio goods exported 39
to Taiwan. Taiwan was also Ohio's fourth-largest import market 40
in Asia in 2023, with $1.694 billion worth of Taiwan goods 41
imported; and 42
WHEREAS, To strengthen the Taiwan-Ohio bilateral economic 43
relationship, it is essential to support Ohio businesses to 44
enhance their economic engagement with Taiwan based on the 1979 45
Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), as the act 46
stipulates that "[w]henever the laws of the United States refer 47
or relate to foreign countries, nations, states, governments, or 48
similar entities, such terms shall include and such laws shall 49
apply with such respect to Taiwan," and it is legitimate for 50
Ohio businesses to refer to Taiwan as Taiwan in conducting 51

business with Taiwan; and 52
WHEREAS, Negotiations for a Bilateral Trade Agreement, the 53
Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement, and the Indo-Pacific 54
Economic Framework for Prosperity between Taiwan and the United 55
States are an important step toward further strengthening 56
bilateral trade between the two countries, thereby increasing 57
Ohio's exports to Taiwan and creating bilateral investment and 58
technical collaboration through mutual trade agreements; and 59
WHEREAS, United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 60
cannot be used to exclude Taiwan from participation in the 61
United Nations system or other international forums, and does 62
not establish the United Nation's stance on Taiwan's ultimate 63
political status, nor does it affirm the People's Republic of 64
China's "one China" principle; and 65
WHEREAS, Taiwan has undertaken in its international 66
relations "Integrated Diplomacy," highlighting three key 67
pillars: Value-based Diplomacy, Alliance-based Diplomacy, and 68
Economic and Trade Diplomacy, in which Taiwan aims to safeguard 69
and bolster its role in global supply chains and strengthen 70
exchanges with like-minded countries, exerting efforts to 71
implement five key trust industry sectors identified by 72
President Lai Ching-te, which include semiconductors, artificial 73
intelligence, defense technology, security and surveillance, and 74
next-generation communications, to not only strengthen Taiwan's 75
critical position in the global supply chain, but also foster 76
closer ties with diplomatic allies, so as to improve its overall 77
security and resilience; now therefore be it 78
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the 136th General 79
Assembly of the State of Ohio, reaffirm our commitment to the 80
strengthening and deepening of the sister ties between the State 81
of Ohio and Taiwan, the Republic of China; and be it further 82

more contributions to international societies; and be it further 99
