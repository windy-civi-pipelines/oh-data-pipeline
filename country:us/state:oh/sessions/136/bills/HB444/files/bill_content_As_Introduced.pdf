As Introduced
under part A of Title XVIII of the "Social Security Act," 49 76
Stat. 620 (1935), 42 U.S.C. 301, as amended. For the purposes of 77
division (A)(10)(a) of this section, "subsidized health plan" 78

dependents, to the extent the expenses exceed seven and one-half 89
per cent of the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income. 90
(c) For purposes of division (A)(10) of this section, 91
"medical care" has the meaning given in section 213 of the 92
Internal Revenue Code, subject to the special rules, 93
limitations, and exclusions set forth therein, and "qualified 94
long-term care" has the same meaning given in section 7702B(c) 95
of the Internal Revenue Code. Solely for purposes of division 96
(A)(10)(a) of this section, "dependent" includes a person who 97
otherwise would be a "qualifying relative" and thus a 98
"dependent" under section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code but 99

support limitations under section 152(d)(1)(B) and (C) of the 101
Internal Revenue Code. 102

section 63 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable United 107
States department of the treasury regulations. The deduction 108
otherwise allowed under division (A)(11)(a) of this section 109
shall be reduced to the extent the reimbursement is attributable 110
to an amount the taxpayer deducted under this section in any 111
taxable year. 112
(b) Add any amount not otherwise included in Ohio adjusted 113
gross income for any taxable year to the extent that the amount 114
is attributable to the recovery during the taxable year of any 115
amount deducted or excluded in computing federal or Ohio 116
adjusted gross income in any taxable year. 117
(12) Deduct any portion of the deduction described in 118
section 1341(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, for repaying 119
previously reported income received under a claim of right, that 120
meets both of the following requirements: 121
(a) It is allowable for repayment of an item that was 122
included in the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for a prior 123
taxable year and did not qualify for a credit under division (A) 124
or (B) of section 5747.05 of the Revised Code for that year; 125
(b) It does not otherwise reduce the taxpayer's adjusted 126
gross income for the current or any other taxable year. 127
(13) Deduct an amount equal to the deposits made to, and 128
net investment earnings of, a medical savings account during the 129
taxable year, in accordance with section 3924.66 of the Revised 130
Code. The deduction allowed by division (A)(13) of this section 131
does not apply to medical savings account deposits and earnings 132
otherwise deducted or excluded for the current or any other 133
taxable year from the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income. 134

computation of the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income as 148
required to be reported for the taxpayer's taxable year under 149
the Internal Revenue Code; 150

department of job and family services pursuant to sections 156
329.11 to 329.14 of the Revised Code for the purpose of matching 157
funds deposited by program participants. On request of the tax 158

investee" includes all persons in the qualifying controlled 1005
group on such last day. 1006
(ii) If the qualifying investee, or if the qualifying 1007
investee and any members of the qualifying controlled group of 1008

the upper level pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year, 1031
the proportionate share of the lower level pass-through entity's 1032
physical assets that the lower level pass-through entity 1033
directly or indirectly owns on the last day of the lower level 1034
pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year ending within or 1035
with the last day of the upper level pass-through entity's 1036
fiscal or calendar year. If the upper level pass-through entity 1037

lower level pass-through entity and if, based upon clear and 1042

cost of the physical assets of the lower pass-through entity is 1044

level pass-through entity for each day during the upper level 1049
pass-through entity's calendar or fiscal year in which or with 1050
which ends the lower level pass-through entity's calendar or 1051

computing any trust's Ohio taxable income. 1054
(b) With respect to a trust that is not a resident for the 1055
taxable year and with respect to a part of a trust that is not a 1056
resident for the taxable year, "qualifying investee" for that 1057
taxable year does not include a C corporation if both of the 1058
