the contract creating the district. 612
(4) Membership on the board of directors of a joint 613
economic development district created under this section is not 614
the holding of a public office or employment within the meaning 615
of any section of the Revised Code prohibiting the holding of 616
other public office or employment. Membership on such a board is 617
not a direct or indirect interest in a contract or expenditure 618
of money by a municipal corporation, township, county, or other 619
political subdivision with which a member may be affiliated. 620
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no member 621
of a board of directors of a joint economic development district 622
shall forfeit or be disqualified from holding any public office 623
or employment by reason of membership on the board. 624
(5) The board of directors of a joint economic development 625

the Revised Code. Chapter 2744. of the Revised Code applies to 627
such a board and the district. 628

business and its employees, file a complaint with the court of 632
common pleas of the county in which the majority of the 633
territory of the district is located requesting exemption from 634

S. B. No. 29 Page 23
As Introduced
any income tax imposed by the board of directors of the district 635
under division (F)(5) of this section if all of the following 636
apply: 637
(a) The business operated within an unincorporated area of 638
the district before the effective date of the district contract; 639
(b) No owner of the business signed a petition described 640
in division (J) of this section; 641
(c) Neither the business nor its employees has derived or 642
will derive any material benefit from the new, expanded, or 643
additional services, facilities, or improvements described in 644
the economic development plan for the district, or the material 645
benefit that has, or will be, derived is negligible in 646
comparison to the income tax revenue generated from the net 647
profits of the business and the income of employees of the 648
business. 649
The legislative authority of each contracting party shall 650
be made a party to the proceedings and the business owner filing 651
the complaint shall serve notice of the complaint by certified 652
mail to each such contracting party. The court shall not accept 653
any complaint filed more than six months after the effective 654
date of the district contract. 655
(2) Any or all of the contracting parties may submit a 656
written answer to the complaint submitted under division (Q)(1) 657
of this section to the court within thirty days after notice of 658
the complaint was served upon them. Such a contracting party 659
shall submit to the court, along with the answer, documentation 660
sufficient to prove that the contracting party sent copies of 661
the answer to the owner of the business who filed the complaint. 662
(3) The court shall review each complaint submitted by a 663

S. B. No. 29 Page 24
As Introduced
business owner under division (Q)(1) of this section and each 664
answer submitted by a contracting party under division (Q)(2) of 665
this section. The court may make a determination on the record 666
and the evidence thus submitted, or it may conduct a hearing and 667
request the presence of the business owner and the contracting 668
parties to present evidence relevant to the complaint. The court 669
shall make a determination on the complaint not sooner than 670
thirty days but not later than sixty days after the complaint is 671
filed by the business owner. The court may make a determination 672
more than sixty days after the complaint is filed if the 673
business owner and all contracting parties to the district 674
consent. 675
(4) The court shall grant the exemption requested in the 676
complaint if all of the criteria described in divisions (Q)(1) 677
(a) to (c) of this section are met. 678
(5) If all the criteria described in divisions (Q)(1)(a) 679
to (c) of this section are not met, the court shall deny the 680
complaint and the exemption. 681
(6) The court shall send notice of the determination with 682
respect to the complaint to the owner of the business and each 683
contracting party. If the court grants the exemption, the net 684
profits of the business from operations within the district and 685
the income of its employees from employment within the district 686
are exempt from any income tax imposed by the board of directors 687
of the district. If the court denies the exemption, the net 688
profits of the business and the income of its employees shall be 689
taxed according to the terms of the district contract and any 690
taxes, penalties, and interest accrued before the date of the 691
court's determination shall be paid in full. In addition, no 692
owner of the business may submit another complaint under 693

division (Q)(1) of this section for the same district contract. 694
The court's determination on a complaint filed under division 695
(Q) of this section is final. 696
(7) Chapter 2506. of the Revised Code does not apply to 697
the proceedings described in division (Q) of this section. 698
(R)(1) No proceeding pursuant to Chapter 709. of the 699
Revised Code that proposes the annexation to, merger of, or 700
consolidation with a municipal corporation of any unincorporated 701
territory within a joint economic development district may be 702
commenced at any time between the effective date of the contract 703
creating the district and the date the contract expires, 704
terminates, or is otherwise rendered unenforceable. This 705
division does not apply if each board of township trustees whose 706
territory is included within the district and whose territory is 707
proposed to be annexed, merged, or consolidated adopts a 708
resolution consenting to the commencement of the proceeding. 709
Each such board of township trustees shall file a copy of the 710
resolution with the clerk of the legislative authority of each 711
county within which a contracting party is located. 712
(2) The contract creating a joint economic development 713
district may prohibit any annexation proceeding by a contracting 714
municipal corporation of any unincorporated territory within the 715
district or zone beyond the period described in division (R)(1) 716
of this section. 717
(3) No contracting party is divested or relieved of its 718
rights or obligations under the contract creating a joint 719
economic development district because of annexation, merger, or 720
consolidation. 721
(S) Contracting parties may enter into agreements pursuant 722

S. B. No. 29 Page 26
As Introduced
to the contract creating a joint economic development district 723
with respect to the substance and administration of zoning and 724
other land use regulations, building codes, permanent public 725
improvements, and other regulatory and proprietary matters 726
determined to be for a public purpose. No contract, however, 727
shall exempt the territory within the district from the 728
procedures of land use regulation applicable pursuant to 729
municipal corporation, township, and county regulations, 730
including, but not limited to, zoning procedures. 731
(T) The powers granted under this section are in addition 732
to and not in the derogation of all other powers possessed by or 733
granted to municipal corporations, townships, and counties 734
pursuant to law. 735
(1) When exercising a power or performing a function or 736
duty under a contract entered into under this section, a 737
municipal corporation may exercise all the powers of a municipal 738
corporation, and may perform all the functions and duties of a 739
municipal corporation, within the district, pursuant to and to 740
the extent consistent with the contract. 741
(2) When exercising a power or performing a function or 742
duty under a contract entered into under division (D) of this 743

the district pursuant to and to the extent consistent with the 746
contract. 747
(3) When exercising a power or performing a function or 748
duty under a contract entered into under this section, a 749

district, pursuant to and to the extent consistent with the 752

contract. 753
(U) No political subdivision shall grant any tax exemption 754
under Chapter 1728. or section 3735.67, 5709.62, 5709.63, or 755
5709.632 of the Revised Code on any property located within the 756
district without the consent of all the contracting parties. The 757
prohibition against granting a tax exemption under this section 758
does not apply to any exemption filed, pending, or approved 759
before the effective date of the contract entered into under 760
this section. 761
Section 2. That existing section 715.72 of the Revised 762
Code is hereby repealed. 763
