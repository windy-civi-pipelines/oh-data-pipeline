continue and the owner shall post a bond or cash deposit to 2104

posted under this section may be applied to the costs. 2125

(G) If a person is found not guilty of committing an 2130
offense, the court immediately shall order the impounding agency 2131
to return the animal to its owner if possible and to return the 2132
entire amount of any bond or cash deposit posted under division 2133
(E) of this section. If the animal cannot be returned because it 2134
has died as a result of neglect or other misconduct by the 2135
impounding agency or if the animal is injured as a result of 2136
neglect or other misconduct by the impounding agency, the court 2137

determined by the court to be equal to the reasonable market 2139
value of the animal at the time that it was impounded plus 2140
statutory interest as defined in section 1343.03 of the Revised 2141
Code from the date of the impoundment or an amount determined by 2142

cash deposit and the payment of the reasonable market value of 2146
the animal shall not apply in the case of a dog that, in 2147

(E) of this section. If the animal cannot be returned because it 2134
has died as a result of neglect or other misconduct by the 2135
impounding agency or if the animal is injured as a result of 2136
neglect or other misconduct by the impounding agency, the court 2137

determined by the court to be equal to the reasonable market 2139
value of the animal at the time that it was impounded plus 2140
statutory interest as defined in section 1343.03 of the Revised 2141
Code from the date of the impoundment or an amount determined by 2142
the court to be equal to the reasonable cost of treatment of the 2143
injury to the animal, as applicable. The requirements 2144
established in this division regarding the return of a bond or 2145
cash deposit and the payment of the reasonable market value of 2146
the animal shall not apply in the case of a dog that, in 2147
