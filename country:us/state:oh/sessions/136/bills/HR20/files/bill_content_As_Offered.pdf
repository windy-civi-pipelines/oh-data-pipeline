Honoring the Mary Lee Tucker Clothe-A-Child Fund on
the occasion of its One Hundredth Anniversary.

General Assembly of Ohio are pleased to extend special recognition to 2
the Mary Lee Tucker Clothe-A-Child Fund on its Centennial celebration; 3
and 4
WHEREAS, Commemoration of this prestigious milestone is, indeed, a 5
fitting tribute to the Mary Lee Tucker Clothe-A-Child Fund, for 6
throughout the past one hundred years, it has achieved a praiseworthy 7
record of service to the area. Founded in 1924 by Rhea Soper Eddy, the 8
organization provides children with winter clothing and footwear, and 9
its accomplishments are a justifiable source of pride and an excellent 10
reflection not only on the fund itself but also on its coordinators, 11
board members, volunteers, donors, and community; and 12
WHEREAS, Since its inception, the Mary Lee Tucker Clothe-A-Child 13
Fund has enhanced the quality of life within the surrounding area, and 14
its generous contributions have earned it the gratitude and respect of 15
the many citizens it has so capably served. We are certain that as 16
this fine endeavor maintains its unfaltering dedication to service, it 17
will continue in the tradition of excellence that has become its 18
hallmark; and 19
WHEREAS, It is through the work of concerned citizens such as all 20
those affiliated with the Mary Lee Tucker Clothe-A-Child Fund that 21
Ohio has gained a reputation as a state whose residents are always 22
ready to extend a helping hand to those in need. The many individuals 23
who have been involved with the work of the society are to be 24
commended for their tremendous efforts to assist others, and they are 25
deserving of praise; therefore be it 26
