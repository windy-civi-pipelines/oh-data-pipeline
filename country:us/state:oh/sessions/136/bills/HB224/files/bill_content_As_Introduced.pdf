temporarily rescind its action. If the board determines that the 1148
decision on appeal was a decision on the merits, it shall 1149
permanently rescind its action. If the board determines that the 1150
decision on appeal was not a decision on the merits, it shall 1151
conduct an adjudication to determine whether the registered 1152
nurse, licensed practical nurse, certified midwife, or dialysis 1153
technician committed the act on which the original conviction, 1154
plea, or judicial finding was based. If the board determines on 1155
the basis of the adjudication that the registered nurse, 1156
licensed practical nurse, certified midwife, or dialysis 1157
technician committed such act, or if the registered nurse, 1158
licensed practical nurse, certified midwife, or dialysis 1159

licensed practical nurse, certified midwife, or dialysis 1188
technician or applicant under this chapter to submit to a mental 1189

referred to the safe haven program as described in sections 1196

or physical examination. 1198
Failure of any individual to submit to a mental or 1199
physical examination when directed constitutes an admission of 1200
the allegations, unless the failure is due to circumstances 1201
beyond the individual's control, and a default and final order 1202
may be entered without the taking of testimony or presentation 1203
of evidence. 1204

H. B. No. 224 Page 43

If the board finds that an individual is impaired, the 1205

authority to practice. The individual shall be afforded an 1209
opportunity to demonstrate to the board that the individual can 1210

examination reports that constitute a privileged communication. 1220

show that any person has violated any provision of this chapter 1222

of any provision of this chapter or rule of the board. In the 1225
absence of bad faith, any person who reports such information or 1226
who testifies before the board in any adjudication conducted 1227
under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code shall not be liable for 1228
civil damages as a result of the report or testimony. 1229

entity except for the purpose of a government investigation, a 1244
prosecution, or an adjudication by a court or government entity. 1245

records, the investigation and proceeding shall be conducted in 1247
such a manner as to protect patient confidentiality. 1248

(K) When the board refuses to grant a license or 1266
certificate to an applicant, revokes a license or certificate, 1267
or refuses to reinstate a license or certificate, the board may 1268
specify that its action is permanent. An individual subject to 1269
permanent action taken by the board is forever ineligible to 1270
hold a license or certificate of the type that was refused or 1271
revoked and the board shall not accept from the individual an 1272

majority vote of the board. No application for a nursing 1278
license, certified midwife license, or dialysis technician 1279
certificate issued under this chapter may be withdrawn without a 1280
majority vote of the board. The board's jurisdiction to take 1281
disciplinary action under this section is not removed or limited 1282
when an individual has a license or certificate classified as 1283
inactive or fails to renew a license or certificate. 1284

against the holder of a license or certificate issued under this 1303
chapter who has a practice deficiency that has been identified 1304
by the board through an investigation conducted under section 1305
4723.28 of the Revised Code. The board may abstain from taking 1306
action only if the board has reason to believe that the 1307
individual's practice deficiency can be corrected through 1308
remediation, and if the individual enters into an agreement with 1309
the board to seek remediation as prescribed by the board, 1310
complies with the terms and conditions of the remediation, and 1311
successfully completes the remediation. If an individual fails 1312
to complete the remediation or the board determines that 1313
remediation cannot correct the individual's practice deficiency, 1314
the board shall proceed with disciplinary action in accordance 1315
with section 4723.28 of the Revised Code. 1316
(C) To implement its authority under this section to 1317
abstain from taking disciplinary action, the board shall 1318

condition of an employee other than one involving the use of a 3445
drug of abuse, to the employer of the employee as described in 3446

the individual to submit to a mental examination, physical 3465
examination, including an HIV test, or both a mental and a 3466

physical examination. The expense of the examination is the 3467
responsibility of the individual compelled to be examined. 3468
Failure to submit to a mental or physical examination or consent 3469
to an HIV test ordered by the board constitutes an admission of 3470
the allegations against the individual unless the failure is due 3471
to circumstances beyond the individual's control, and a default 3472
and final order may be entered without the taking of testimony 3473
or presentation of evidence. If the board finds an individual 3474
unable to practice because of the reasons set forth in this 3475
division, the board shall require the individual to submit to 3476
care, counseling, or treatment by physicians approved or 3477
designated by the board, as a condition for initial, continued, 3478
reinstated, or renewed authority to practice. An individual 3479
affected under this division shall be afforded an opportunity to 3480
demonstrate to the board the ability to resume practice in 3481
compliance with acceptable and prevailing standards under the 3482
provisions of the individual's license or certificate. For the 3483
purpose of this division, any individual who applies for or 3484
receives a license or certificate to practice under this chapter 3485
accepts the privilege of practicing in this state and, by so 3486
doing, shall be deemed to have given consent to submit to a 3487
mental or physical examination when directed to do so in writing 3488
by the board, and to have waived all objections to the 3489
admissibility of testimony or examination reports that 3490
constitute a privileged communication. 3491

drug of abuse, to the employer of the employee as described in 3505
division (B) of section 2305.33 of the Revised Code. Nothing in 3506

section; 3534
(24) The revocation, suspension, restriction, reduction, 3535

For the purposes of this division, any individual 3548
authorized to practice by this chapter accepts the privilege of 3549
practicing in this state subject to supervision by the board. By 3550
filing an application for or holding a license or certificate to 3551
practice under this chapter, an individual shall be deemed to 3552
have given consent to submit to a mental or physical examination 3553
when ordered to do so by the board in writing, and to have 3554
waived all objections to the admissibility of testimony or 3555
examination reports that constitute privileged communications. 3556

If it has reason to believe that any individual authorized 3557
to practice by this chapter or any applicant for licensure or 3558
certification to practice suffers such impairment, the board 3559
shall refer the individual to the monitoring organization that 3560
conducts the confidential monitoring program established under 3561
section 4731.25 of the Revised Code. The board also may compel 3562
the individual to submit to a mental or physical examination, or 3563
both. The expense of the examination is the responsibility of 3564
the individual compelled to be examined. Any mental or physical 3565
examination required under this division shall be undertaken by 3566
a treatment provider or physician who is qualified to conduct 3567
the examination and who is approved under section 4731.251 of 3568
the Revised Code. 3569
Failure to submit to a mental or physical examination 3570
ordered by the board constitutes an admission of the allegations 3571
against the individual unless the failure is due to 3572
circumstances beyond the individual's control, and a default and 3573
final order may be entered without the taking of testimony or 3574
presentation of evidence. If the board determines that the 3575
individual's ability to practice is impaired, the board shall 3576
suspend the individual's license or certificate or deny the 3577
individual's application and shall require the individual, as a 3578
condition for initial, continued, reinstated, or renewed 3579
licensure or certification to practice, to submit to treatment. 3580
Before being eligible to apply for reinstatement of a 3581
license or certificate suspended under this division, the 3582
impaired practitioner shall demonstrate to the board the ability 3583
to resume practice in compliance with acceptable and prevailing 3584
standards of care under the provisions of the practitioner's 3585
license or certificate. The demonstration shall include, but 3586
shall not be limited to, the following: 3587

aftercare contract or consent agreement; 3592
(c) Two written reports indicating that the individual's 3593
ability to practice has been assessed and that the individual 3594
has been found capable of practicing according to acceptable and 3595
prevailing standards of care. The reports shall be made by 3596
individuals or providers approved by the board for making the 3597
assessments and shall describe the basis for their 3598
determination. 3599
The board may reinstate a license or certificate suspended 3600
under this division after that demonstration and after the 3601
individual has entered into a written consent agreement. 3602
When the impaired practitioner resumes practice, the board 3603
shall require continued monitoring of the individual. The 3604
monitoring shall include, but not be limited to, compliance with 3605
the written consent agreement entered into before reinstatement 3606
or with conditions imposed by board order after a hearing, and, 3607
upon termination of the consent agreement, submission to the 3608
board for at least two years of annual written progress reports 3609
made under penalty of perjury stating whether the individual has 3610
maintained sobriety. 3611

testifies before the board in any adjudication conducted under 3787
Chapter 119. of the Revised Code shall not be liable in damages 3788

supervising member elected by the board in accordance with 3795
section 4731.02 of the Revised Code and by the secretary as 3796
provided in section 4731.39 of the Revised Code. The president 3797
may designate another member of the board to supervise the 3798
investigation in place of the supervising member. Upon a vote of 3799
the majority of the board to authorize the addition of a 3800
consumer member in the supervision of any part of any 3801
investigation, the president shall designate a consumer member 3802
for supervision of investigations as determined by the 3803

Code, the board may question witnesses, conduct interviews, 3812
administer oaths, order the taking of depositions, inspect and 3813
copy any books, accounts, papers, records, or documents, issue 3814
subpoenas, and compel the attendance of witnesses and production 3815

except that a subpoena for patient record information shall not 3817
be issued without consultation with the attorney general's 3818
office and approval of the secretary of the board. 3819
(a) Before issuance of a subpoena for patient record 3820
information, the secretary shall determine whether there is 3821
probable cause to believe that the complaint filed alleges a 3822
violation of this chapter or any rule adopted under it and that 3823

H. B. No. 224 Page 134
As Introduced
the records sought are relevant to the alleged violation and 3824
material to the investigation. The subpoena may apply only to 3825
records that cover a reasonable period of time surrounding the 3826
alleged violation. 3827
(b) On failure to comply with any subpoena issued by the 3828
board and after reasonable notice to the person being 3829
subpoenaed, the board may move for an order compelling the 3830
production of persons or records pursuant to the Rules of Civil 3831
Procedure. 3832
(c) A subpoena issued by the board may be served by a 3833
sheriff, the sheriff's deputy, or a board employee or agent 3834
designated by the board. Service of a subpoena issued by the 3835
board may be made by delivering a copy of the subpoena to the 3836
person named therein, reading it to the person, or leaving it at 3837
the person's usual place of residence, usual place of business, 3838
or address on file with the board. When serving a subpoena to an 3839
applicant for or the holder of a license or certificate issued 3840
under this chapter, service of the subpoena may be made by 3841
certified mail, return receipt requested, and the subpoena shall 3842
be deemed served on the date delivery is made or the date the 3843
person refuses to accept delivery. If the person being served 3844
refuses to accept the subpoena or is not located, service may be 3845
made to an attorney who notifies the board that the attorney is 3846
representing the person. 3847
(d) A sheriff's deputy who serves a subpoena shall receive 3848
the same fees as a sheriff. Each witness who appears before the 3849
board in obedience to a subpoena shall receive the fees and 3850
mileage provided for under section 119.094 of the Revised Code. 3851

(5) A report required to be submitted to the board under 3855
this chapter, a complaint, or information received by the board 3856
pursuant to an investigation or pursuant to an inspection under 3857
division (E) of section 4731.054 of the Revised Code is 3858
confidential and not subject to discovery in any civil action. 3859
The board shall conduct all investigations or inspections 3860
and proceedings in a manner that protects the confidentiality of 3861
patients and persons who file complaints with the board. The 3862
board shall not make public the names or any other identifying 3863
information about patients or complainants unless proper consent 3864
is given or, in the case of a patient, a waiver of the patient 3865
privilege exists under division (B) of section 2317.02 of the 3866
Revised Code, except that consent or a waiver of that nature is 3867
not required if the board possesses reliable and substantial 3868
evidence that no bona fide physician-patient relationship 3869
exists. 3870
The board may share any information it receives pursuant 3871
to an investigation or inspection, including patient records and 3872
patient record information, with law enforcement agencies, other 3873
licensing boards, and other governmental agencies that are 3874
prosecuting, adjudicating, or investigating alleged violations 3875
of statutes or administrative rules. An agency or board that 3876
receives the information shall comply with the same requirements 3877
regarding confidentiality as those with which the state medical 3878
board must comply, notwithstanding any conflicting provision of 3879
the Revised Code or procedure of the agency or board that 3880
applies when it is dealing with other information in its 3881
possession. In a judicial proceeding, the information may be 3882
admitted into evidence only in accordance with the Rules of 3883

are taken to ensure that confidentiality is maintained with 3885
respect to any part of the information that contains names or 3886
other identifying information about patients or complainants 3887
whose confidentiality was protected by the state medical board 3888
when the information was in the board's possession. Measures to 3889
ensure confidentiality that may be taken by the court include 3890
sealing its records or deleting specific information from its 3891
records. 3892
No person shall knowingly access, use, or disclose 3893
confidential investigatory information in a manner prohibited by 3894
law. 3895
(6) On a quarterly basis, the board shall prepare a report 3896
that documents the disposition of all cases during the preceding 3897
three months. The report shall contain the following information 3898
for each case with which the board has completed its activities: 3899
(a) The case number assigned to the complaint or alleged 3900
violation; 3901
(b) The type of license or certificate to practice, if 3902
any, held by the individual against whom the complaint is 3903
directed; 3904
(c) A description of the allegations contained in the 3905
complaint; 3906
(d) Whether witnesses were interviewed; 3907
(e) Whether the individual against whom the complaint is 3908

(f) The disposition of the case. 3910
The report shall state how many cases are still pending 3911

H. B. No. 224 Page 137

and shall be prepared in a manner that protects the identity of 3912
each person involved in each case. The report shall be a public 3913
record under section 149.43 of the Revised Code. 3914
(7) The board may provide a status update regarding an 3915
investigation to a complainant on request if the board verifies 3916

(G)(1) If either of the following circumstances occur, the 3918
secretary and supervising member may recommend that the board 3919
suspend an individual's license or certificate to practice or 3920
certificate to recommend without a prior hearing: 3921
(a) The secretary and supervising member determine both of 3922
the following: 3923
(i) That there is clear and convincing evidence that an 3924
individual has violated division (B) of this section; 3925
(ii) That the individual's continued practice presents a 3926
danger of immediate and serious harm to the public. 3927
(b) The board receives verifiable information that a 3928
licensee has been charged in any state or federal court with a 3929
crime classified as a felony under the charging court's law and 3930
the conduct constitutes a violation of division (B) of this 3931
section. 3932
(2) If a recommendation is made to suspend without a prior 3933
hearing pursuant to division (G)(1) of this section, written 3934
allegations shall be prepared for consideration by the board. 3935
The board, upon review of those allegations and by an 3936
affirmative vote of not fewer than six of its members, excluding 3937
the secretary and supervising member, may suspend a license or 3938
certificate without a prior hearing. A telephone conference call 3939
may be utilized for reviewing the allegations and taking the 3940

vote on the summary suspension. 3941
The board shall serve a written order of suspension in 3942
accordance with sections 119.05 and 119.07 of the Revised Code. 3943
The order shall not be subject to suspension by the court during 3944
pendency of any appeal filed under section 119.12 of the Revised 3945
Code. If the individual subject to the summary suspension 3946
requests an adjudicatory hearing by the board, the date set for 3947
the hearing shall be within fifteen days, but not earlier than 3948
seven days, after the individual requests the hearing, unless 3949
otherwise agreed to by both the board and the individual. 3950
(3) Any summary suspension imposed under this division 3951
shall remain in effect, unless reversed on appeal, until a final 3952
adjudicative order issued by the board pursuant to this section 3953
and Chapter 119. of the Revised Code becomes effective. The 3954
board shall issue its final adjudicative order within seventy- 3955
five days after completion of its hearing. A failure to issue 3956
the order within seventy-five days shall result in dissolution 3957
of the summary suspension order but shall not invalidate any 3958
subsequent, final adjudicative order. 3959
(H) If the board takes action under division (B)(9), (11), 3960
or (13) of this section and the judicial finding of guilt, 3961
guilty plea, or judicial finding of eligibility for intervention 3962
in lieu of conviction is overturned on appeal, upon exhaustion 3963
of the criminal appeal, a petition for reconsideration of the 3964
order may be filed with the board along with appropriate court 3965
documents. Upon receipt of a petition of that nature and 3966
supporting court documents, the board shall reinstate the 3967
individual's license or certificate to practice. The board may 3968
then hold an adjudication under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code 3969
to determine whether the individual committed the act in 3970

question. Notice of an opportunity for a hearing shall be given 3971
in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code. If the 3972
board finds, pursuant to an adjudication held under this 3973
division, that the individual committed the act or if no hearing 3974
is requested, the board may order any of the sanctions 3975
identified under division (B) of this section. 3976
(I) The license or certificate to practice issued to an 3977
individual under this chapter and the individual's practice in 3978
this state are automatically suspended as of the date of the 3979
individual's second or subsequent plea of guilty to, or judicial 3980
finding of guilt of, a violation of section 2919.123 or 2919.124 3981
of the Revised Code. In addition, the license or certificate to 3982
practice or certificate to recommend issued to an individual 3983
under this chapter and the individual's practice in this state 3984
are automatically suspended as of the date the individual pleads 3985
guilty to, is found by a judge or jury to be guilty of, or is 3986
subject to a judicial finding of eligibility for intervention in 3987
lieu of conviction in this state or treatment or intervention in 3988
lieu of conviction in another jurisdiction for any of the 3989
following criminal offenses in this state or a substantially 3990
equivalent criminal offense in another jurisdiction: aggravated 3991
murder, murder, voluntary manslaughter, felonious assault, 3992
trafficking in persons, kidnapping, rape, sexual battery, gross 3993
sexual imposition, aggravated arson, aggravated robbery, or 3994
aggravated burglary. Continued practice after suspension shall 3995
be considered practicing without a license or certificate. 3996
The board shall notify the individual subject to the 3997
suspension in accordance with sections 119.05 and 119.07 of the 3998
Revised Code. If an individual whose license or certificate is 3999
automatically suspended under this division fails to make a 4000
timely request for an adjudication under Chapter 119. of the 4001

H. B. No. 224 Page 140
As Introduced
Revised Code, the board shall do whichever of the following is 4002
applicable: 4003
(1) If the automatic suspension under this division is for 4004
a second or subsequent plea of guilty to, or judicial finding of 4005
guilt of, a violation of section 2919.123 or 2919.124 of the 4006
Revised Code, the board shall enter an order suspending the 4007
individual's license or certificate to practice for a period of 4008
at least one year or, if determined appropriate by the board, 4009
imposing a more serious sanction involving the individual's 4010
license or certificate to practice. 4011
(2) In all circumstances in which division (I)(1) of this 4012
section does not apply, enter a final order permanently revoking 4013
the individual's license or certificate to practice. 4014
(J) If the board is required by Chapter 119. of the 4015
Revised Code to give notice of an opportunity for a hearing and 4016
if the individual subject to the notice does not timely request 4017
a hearing in accordance with section 119.07 of the Revised Code, 4018
the board is not required to hold a hearing, but may adopt, by 4019
an affirmative vote of not fewer than six of its members, a 4020
final order that contains the board's findings. In that final 4021
order, the board may order any of the sanctions identified under 4022
division (A) or (B) of this section. 4023
(K) Any action taken by the board under division (B) of 4024
this section resulting in a suspension from practice shall be 4025
accompanied by a written statement of the conditions under which 4026
the individual's license or certificate to practice may be 4027
reinstated. The board shall adopt rules governing conditions to 4028
be imposed for reinstatement. Reinstatement of a license or 4029
certificate suspended pursuant to division (B) of this section 4030
requires an affirmative vote of not fewer than six members of 4031

H. B. No. 224 Page 141
As Introduced
the board. 4032
(L) When the board refuses to grant or issue a license or 4033
certificate to practice to an applicant, revokes an individual's 4034
license or certificate to practice, refuses to renew an 4035
individual's license or certificate to practice, or refuses to 4036
reinstate an individual's license or certificate to practice, 4037
the board may specify that its action is permanent. An 4038
individual subject to a permanent action taken by the board is 4039
forever thereafter ineligible to hold a license or certificate 4040
to practice and the board shall not accept an application for 4041
reinstatement of the license or certificate or for issuance of a 4042
new license or certificate. 4043
(M) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Revised 4044
Code, all of the following apply: 4045
(1) The surrender of a license or certificate issued under 4046
this chapter shall not be effective unless or until accepted by 4047
the board. A telephone conference call may be utilized for 4048
acceptance of the surrender of an individual's license or 4049
certificate to practice. The telephone conference call shall be 4050
considered a special meeting under division (F) of section 4051
121.22 of the Revised Code. Reinstatement of a license or 4052
certificate surrendered to the board requires an affirmative 4053
vote of not fewer than six members of the board. 4054
(2) An application for a license or certificate made under 4055
the provisions of this chapter may not be withdrawn without 4056
approval of the board. 4057
(3) Failure by an individual to renew a license or 4058
certificate to practice in accordance with this chapter or a 4059
certificate to recommend in accordance with rules adopted under 4060

H. B. No. 224 Page 142
As Introduced
section 4731.301 of the Revised Code does not remove or limit 4061
the board's jurisdiction to take any disciplinary action under 4062
this section against the individual. 4063
(4) The placement of an individual's license on retired 4064
status, as described in section 4731.283 of the Revised Code, 4065
does not remove or limit the board's jurisdiction to take any 4066
disciplinary action against the individual with regard to the 4067
license as it existed before being placed on retired status. 4068
(5) At the request of the board, a license or certificate 4069
holder shall immediately surrender to the board a license or 4070
certificate that the board has suspended, revoked, or 4071
permanently revoked. 4072
(N) Sanctions shall not be imposed under division (B)(28) 4073
of this section against any person who waives deductibles and 4074
copayments as follows: 4075
(1) In compliance with the health benefit plan that 4076
expressly allows such a practice. Waiver of the deductibles or 4077
copayments shall be made only with the full knowledge and 4078
consent of the plan purchaser, payer, and third-party 4079
administrator. Documentation of the consent shall be made 4080
available to the board upon request. 4081
(2) For professional services rendered to any other person 4082
authorized to practice pursuant to this chapter, to the extent 4083
allowed by this chapter and rules adopted by the board. 4084
(O) Under the board's investigative duties described in 4085
this section and subject to division (F) of this section, the 4086
board shall develop and implement a quality intervention program 4087
designed to improve through remedial education the clinical and 4088
communication skills of individuals authorized under this 4089

As Introduced
chapter to practice medicine and surgery, osteopathic medicine 4090
and surgery, and podiatric medicine and surgery. In developing 4091
and implementing the quality intervention program, the board may 4092
do all of the following: 4093
(1) Offer in appropriate cases as determined by the board 4094
an educational and assessment program pursuant to an 4095
investigation the board conducts under this section; 4096
(2) Select providers of educational and assessment 4097
services, including a quality intervention program panel of case 4098
reviewers; 4099
(3) Make referrals to educational and assessment service 4100
providers and approve individual educational programs 4101
recommended by those providers. The board shall monitor the 4102
progress of each individual undertaking a recommended individual 4103
educational program. 4104
(4) Determine what constitutes successful completion of an 4105
individual educational program and require further monitoring of 4106
the individual who completed the program or other action that 4107
the board determines to be appropriate; 4108
(5) Adopt rules in accordance with Chapter 119. of the 4109
Revised Code to further implement the quality intervention 4110
program. 4111
An individual who participates in an individual 4112
educational program pursuant to this division shall pay the 4113
financial obligations arising from that educational program. 4114
(P) The board shall not refuse to issue a license to an 4115
applicant because of a conviction, plea of guilty, judicial 4116
finding of guilt, judicial finding of eligibility for 4117
intervention in lieu of conviction, or the commission of an act 4118

H. B. No. 224 Page 144

that constitutes a criminal offense, unless the refusal is in 4119
accordance with section 9.79 of the Revised Code. 4120
(Q) A license or certificate to practice or certificate to 4121
recommend issued to an individual under this chapter and an 4122
individual's practice under this chapter in this state are 4123
automatically suspended if the individual's license or 4124
certificate to practice a health care occupation or provide 4125
health care services is suspended, revoked, or surrendered or 4126
relinquished in lieu of discipline by an agency responsible for 4127
authorizing, certifying, or regulating an individual to practice 4128
a health care occupation or provide health care services in this 4129
state or another jurisdiction. The automatic suspension begins 4130
immediately upon entry of the order by the agency and lasts for 4131
ninety days to permit the board to investigate the basis for the 4132
action under this chapter. Continued practice during the 4133
automatic suspension shall be considered practicing without a 4134
license or certificate. 4135
The board shall notify the individual subject to the 4136
automatic suspension by certified mail or in person in 4137
accordance with section 119.07 of the Revised Code. If an 4138
individual subject to an automatic suspension under this 4139
division fails to make a timely request for an adjudication 4140
under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code, the board is not 4141
required to hold a hearing, but may adopt, by an affirmative 4142
vote of not fewer than six of its members, a final order that 4143
contains the board's findings. In that final order, the board 4144
may order any of the sanctions identified under division (A) or 4145
(B) of this section. 4146
Sec. 4731.27. (A) As used in this section, 4147
"collaboration," "physician," "standard care arrangement," and 4148

H. B. No. 224 Page 145

"supervision" have the same meanings as in section 4723.01 of 4149
the Revised Code. 4150
(B) A physician or podiatrist shall enter into a standard 4151
care arrangement with each certified midwife, clinical nurse 4152
specialist, certified nurse-midwife, or certified nurse 4153
practitioner with whom the physician or podiatrist is in 4154
collaboration. 4155
The collaborating physician or podiatrist shall fulfill 4156
the responsibilities of collaboration, as specified in the 4157
arrangement and in accordance with division (A) of section 4158
4723.431 of the Revised Code. A copy of the standard care 4159
arrangement shall be retained on file by the certified midwife's 4160
or nurse's employer. Prior approval of the standard care 4161
arrangement by the state medical board is not required, but the 4162
board may periodically review it. 4163
A physician or podiatrist who terminates collaboration 4164
with a certified midwife, certified nurse-midwife, certified 4165
nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist before their 4166
standard care arrangement expires shall give the certified 4167
midwife or nurse the written or electronic notice of termination 4168
required by division (D)(1) of section 4723.431 of the Revised 4169
Code. 4170
Nothing in this division prohibits a hospital from hiring 4171
a certified midwife, clinical nurse specialist, certified nurse- 4172
midwife, or certified nurse practitioner as an employee and 4173
negotiating standard care arrangements on behalf of the employee 4174
as necessary to meet the requirements of this section. A 4175
standard care arrangement between the hospital's employee and 4176
the employee's collaborating physician is subject to approval by 4177
the medical staff and governing body of the hospital prior to 4178

H. B. No. 224 Page 146

implementation of the arrangement at the hospital. 4179
(C) A physician or podiatrist shall cooperate with the 4180
board of nursing in any investigation the board conducts with 4181
respect to a certified midwife, clinical nurse specialist, 4182
certified nurse-midwife, or certified nurse practitioner who 4183
collaborates with the physician or podiatrist or with respect to 4184
a certified registered nurse anesthetist who practices with the 4185
supervision of the physician or podiatrist. 4186
