As Introduced
Sec. 319.301. (A) The reductions required by division (D) 22
of this section do not apply to any of the following: 23
(1) Taxes levied at whatever rate is required to produce a 24
specified amount of tax money, including a tax levied under 25
section 5705.199 or 5748.09 of the Revised Code, or an amount to 26
pay debt charges; 27
(2) Taxes levied within the one per cent limitation 28
imposed by Section 2 of Article XII, Ohio Constitution; 29
(3) Taxes provided for by the charter of a municipal 30
corporation. 31
(B) As used in this section: 32
(1) "Real property" includes real property owned by a 33
railroad. 34
(2) "Carryover property" means all real property on the 35
current year's tax list except: 36
(a) Land and improvements that were not taxed by the 37
district in both the preceding year and the current year; 38
(b) Land and improvements that were not in the same class 39
in both the preceding year and the current year. 40
(3) "Effective tax rate" means with respect to each class 41
of property: 42
(a) The sum of the total taxes that would have been 43
charged and payable for current expenses against real property 44
in that class if each of the district's taxes were reduced for 45
the current year under division (D)(1) of this section without 46
regard to the application of division (E)(3) of this section 47
divided by 48

H. B. No. 335 Page 3
As Introduced
(b) The taxable value of all real property in that class. 49
(4) "Taxes charged and payable" means the taxes charged 50
and payable prior to any reduction required by section 319.302 51
or, if applicable, section 319.303 of the Revised Code. 52
(C) The tax commissioner shall make the determinations 53
required by this section each year, without regard to whether a 54
taxing district has territory in a county to which section 55
5715.24 of the Revised Code applies for that year. Separate 56
determinations shall be made for each of the two classes 57
established pursuant to section 5713.041 of the Revised Code. 58
(D) With respect to each tax authorized to be levied by 59
each taxing district, the tax commissioner, annually, shall do 60
both of the following: 61
(1) Determine by what percentage, if any, the sums levied 62
by such tax against the carryover property in each class would 63
have to be reduced for the tax to levy the same number of 64
dollars against such property in that class in the current year 65
as were charged against such property by such tax in the 66
preceding year subsequent to the reduction made under this 67
section but before the reduction made under section 319.302 of 68
the Revised Code. In the case of a tax levied for the first time 69
that is not a renewal of an existing tax, the commissioner shall 70
determine by what percentage the sums that would otherwise be 71
levied by such tax against carryover property in each class 72
would have to be reduced to equal the amount that would have 73
been levied if the full rate thereof had been imposed against 74
the total taxable value of such property in the preceding tax 75
year. A tax or portion of a tax that is designated a replacement 76
levy under section 5705.192 of the Revised Code is not a renewal 77
of an existing tax for purposes of this division. 78

(2) Certify each percentage determined in division (D)(1) 79
of this section, as adjusted under division (E) of this section, 80
and the class of property to which that percentage applies to 81
the auditor of each county in which the district has territory. 82
The auditor, after complying with section 319.30 of the Revised 83
Code, shall reduce the sum to be levied by such tax against each 84
parcel of real property in the district by the percentage so 85
certified for its class. Certification shall be made by the 86
first day of September except in the case of a tax levied for 87
the first time, in which case certification shall be made within 88
fifteen days of the date the county auditor submits the 89
information necessary to make the required determination. 90
(E)(1) As used in division (E)(2) of this section, "pre- 91
1982 joint vocational taxes" means, with respect to a class of 92
property, the difference between the following amounts: 93
(a) The taxes charged and payable in tax year 1981 against 94
the property in that class for the current expenses of the joint 95
vocational school district of which the school district is a 96
part after making all reductions under this section; 97
(b) Two-tenths of one per cent of the taxable value of all 98
real property in that class. 99
If the amount in division (E)(1)(b) of this section 100
exceeds the amount in division (E)(1)(a) of this section, the 101
pre-1982 joint vocational taxes shall be zero. 102
As used in divisions (E)(2) and (3) of this section, 103
"taxes charged and payable" has the same meaning as in division 104
(B)(4) of this section and excludes any tax charged and payable 105
in 1985 or thereafter under sections 5705.194 to 5705.197 or 106
section 5705.199, 5705.213, 5705.219, or 5748.09 of the Revised 107

Code. 108
(2) If in the case of a school district other than a joint 109
vocational or cooperative education school district any 110
percentage required to be used in division (D)(2) of this 111
section for either class of property could cause the total taxes 112
charged and payable for current expenses to be less than two per 113
cent of the taxable value of all real property in that class 114
that is subject to taxation by the district, the commissioner 115
shall determine what percentages would cause the district's 116
total taxes charged and payable for current expenses against 117
that class, after all reductions that would otherwise be made 118
under this section, to equal, when combined with the pre-1982 119
joint vocational taxes against that class, the lesser of the 120
following: 121
(a) The sum of the rates at which those taxes are 122
authorized to be levied; 123
(b) Two per cent of the taxable value of the property in 124
that class. The auditor shall use such percentages in making the 125
reduction required by this section for that class. 126
(3) If in the case of a joint vocational school district 127
any percentage required to be used in division (D)(2) of this 128
section for either class of property could cause the total taxes 129
charged and payable for current expenses for that class to be 130
less than two-tenths of one per cent of the taxable value of 131
that class, the commissioner shall determine what percentages 132
would cause the district's total taxes charged and payable for 133
current expenses for that class, after all reductions that would 134
otherwise be made under this section, to equal that amount. The 135
auditor shall use such percentages in making the reductions 136
required by this section for that class. 137

H. B. No. 335 Page 6
As Introduced
(4) If a school district is affected by division (E)(2) or 138
(3) of this section for either class of property, and additional 139
current expense taxes are levied or are included in the 140
definition of taxes charged and payable, then, for the first tax 141
year those taxes are levied or included, the reduction computed 142
under division (D) of this section for that district shall be 143
computed as though the sums of current expenses taxes levied for 144
the district and charged against that class in the preceding tax 145
year were equivalent to two per cent or two-tenths of one per 146
cent, respectively, of the taxable value of all real property in 147
that class. 148
(F) No reduction shall be made under this section in the 149
rate at which any tax is levied. 150
(G) The commissioner may order a county auditor to furnish 151
any information the commissioner needs to make the 152
determinations required under division (D) or (E) of this 153
section, and the auditor shall supply the information in the 154
form and by the date specified in the order. If the auditor 155
fails to comply with an order issued under this division, except 156
for good cause as determined by the commissioner, the 157
commissioner shall withhold from such county or taxing district 158
therein fifty per cent of state revenues to local governments 159
pursuant to section 5747.50 of the Revised Code or shall direct 160
the department of education and workforce to withhold therefrom 161
fifty per cent of state revenues to school districts pursuant to 162
Chapter 3317. of the Revised Code. The commissioner shall 163
withhold the distribution of such revenues until the county 164
auditor has complied with this division, and the department 165
shall withhold the distribution of such revenues until the 166
commissioner has notified the department that the county auditor 167
has complied with this division. 168

(H) If the commissioner is unable to certify a tax 169
reduction factor for either class of property in a taxing 170
district located in more than one county by the last day of 171
November because information required under division (G) of this 172
section is unavailable, the commissioner may compute and certify 173
an estimated tax reduction factor for that district for that 174
class. The estimated factor shall be based upon an estimate of 175
the unavailable information. Upon receipt of the actual 176
information for a taxing district that received an estimated tax 177
reduction factor, the commissioner shall compute the actual tax 178
reduction factor and use that factor to compute the taxes that 179
should have been charged and payable against each parcel of 180
property for the year for which the estimated reduction factor 181
was used. The amount by which the estimated factor resulted in 182
an overpayment or underpayment in taxes on any parcel shall be 183
added to or subtracted from the amount due on that parcel in the 184
ensuing tax year. 185
A percentage or a tax reduction factor determined or 186
computed by the commissioner under this section shall be used 187
solely for the purpose of reducing the sums to be levied by the 188
tax to which it applies for the year for which it was determined 189
or computed. It shall not be used in making any tax computations 190
for any ensuing tax year. 191
(I) In making the determinations under division (D)(1) of 192
this section, the tax commissioner shall take account of changes 193
in the taxable value of carryover property resulting from 194
complaints filed under section 5715.19 of the Revised Code for 195
determinations made for the tax year in which such changes are 196
reported to the commissioner. Such changes shall be reported to 197
the commissioner on the first abstract of real property filed 198
with the commissioner under section 5715.23 of the Revised Code 199

H. B. No. 335 Page 8
As Introduced
following the date on which the complaint is finally determined 200
by the board of revision or by a court or other authority with 201
jurisdiction on appeal. The tax commissioner shall account for 202
such changes in making the determinations only for the tax year 203
in which the change in valuation is reported. Such a valuation 204
change shall not be used to recompute the percentages determined 205
under division (D)(1) of this section for any prior tax year. 206

board shall certify a copy of the resolution, or a copy of any 381
resolution repealing the reduction's authorization, to the 382
county auditor and tax commissioner within thirty days after its 383
adoption. The reduction shall apply or cease to apply, in the 384
case of real property taxes, to the first tax year ending after 385
this thirty-day period or, in the case of manufactured home 386
taxes, the first tax year beginning after this period. 387

authorized under division (A)(1) of section 323.152 or division 401
(A) of section 4503.065 of the Revised Code shall not qualify 402

If the person has not already reported the person's total 407
income under section 323.153 or 4503.066 of the Revised Code for 408
the purpose of the homestead exemption, the person shall not be 409
eligible to receive a reduction under this section unless the 410

income in accordance with the applicable section. 415
Sec. 323.08. (A) After certifying the tax list and 416
duplicate pursuant to section 319.28 of the Revised Code, the 417
county auditor shall deliver a list of the tax rates, tax 418
reduction factors, and effective tax rates assessed and applied 419
against each of the two classes of property of the county to the 420
county treasurer, who shall immediately cause a schedule of such 421
tax rates and effective rates to be published using at least one 422
of the following methods: 423

general circulation in the county; 425
(2) On the official public notice web site established 426
under section 125.182 of the Revised Code; 427
(3) On the web site and social media account of the 428
county. 429
Alternatively, in lieu of such publication, the county 430
treasurer may insert a copy of such schedule with each tax bill 431
mailed. Such schedule shall specify particularly the rates and 432
effective rates of taxation levied for all purposes on the tax 433

within the county, expressed in dollars and cents for each one 435
thousand dollars of valuation. The effective tax rates shall be 436
printed in boldface type. 437
(B) The county treasurer shall publish notice of the date 438
of the last date for payment of each installment of taxes once a 439
week for two successive weeks before such date using at least 440
one of the following methods: 441
(1) In the print or digital edition of a newspaper of 442
general circulation within the county; 443
(2) On the official public notice web site established 444
under section 125.182 of the Revised Code; 445
(3) On the web site and social media account of the 446

such date will accrue a penalty and interest and that failure to 449
receive a tax bill will not avoid such penalty and interest. The 450
notice shall contain a telephone number that may be called by 451
taxpayers who have not received tax bills. 452
(C) As used in this section and section 323.131 of the 453
Revised Code, "effective tax rate" means the effective rate 454
after making the reduction required by section 319.301, but 455
before making the reduction required by section 319.302 or, if 456
applicable, 319.303 of the Revised Code. 457
Sec. 323.152. In addition to the reduction in taxes 458
required under section sections 319.302 , 319.303, and 319.304 459

amounts described in divisions (A)(1)(c)(i), (A)(2), and (A)(3) 514
of this section by completing the following calculations in 515

(ii) Multiply that percentage increase by the total income 522
threshold or reduction amount for the current tax year, as 523
applicable; 524
(iii) Add the resulting product to the total income 525
threshold or the reduction amount, as applicable, for the 526

commissioner shall not make the applicable adjustment in any 536
calendar year in which the amount resulting from the adjustment 537
would be less than the total income threshold or the reduction 538
amount for the current tax year. 539
(2)(a) Real property taxes on a homestead owned and 540
occupied, or a homestead in a housing cooperative occupied, by a 541
disabled veteran shall be reduced for each year for which an 542
application for the reduction has been approved. The reduction 543

dollars of the true value of the property in money, as adjusted 545
under division (A)(1)(d) of this section, by the amounts 546
described in divisions (A)(1)(c)(ii) to (iv) of this section. 547
The reduction is in lieu of any reduction under section 323.158 548

H. B. No. 335 Page 20
As Introduced
of the Revised Code or division (A)(1), (2)(b), or (3) of this 549
section. The reduction applies to only one homestead owned and 550
occupied by a disabled veteran. 551
(b) Real property taxes on a homestead owned and occupied, 552
or a homestead in a housing cooperative occupied, by the 553
surviving spouse of a disabled veteran shall be reduced for each 554
year an application for exemption is approved. The reduction 555
shall equal to the amount of the reduction authorized under 556
division (A)(2)(a) of this section. 557
The reduction is in lieu of any reduction under section 558
323.158 of the Revised Code or division (A)(1), (2)(a), or (3) 559
of this section. The reduction applies to only one homestead 560
owned and occupied by the surviving spouse of a disabled 561
veteran. A homestead qualifies for a reduction in taxes under 562
division (A)(2)(b) of this section beginning in one of the 563
following tax years: 564
(i) For a surviving spouse described in division (L)(1) of 565
section 323.151 of the Revised Code, the year the disabled 566
veteran dies; 567
(ii) For a surviving spouse described in division (L)(2) 568
of section 323.151 of the Revised Code, the first year on the 569
first day of January of which the total disability rating 570
described in division (F) of that section has been received for 571
the deceased spouse. 572
In either case, the reduction shall continue through the 573
tax year in which the surviving spouse dies or remarries. 574

or a homestead in a housing cooperative occupied, by the 576
surviving spouse of a public service officer killed in the line 577

of duty shall be reduced for each year for which an application 578
for the reduction has been approved. The reduction shall equal 579
the product obtained by multiplying fifty thousand dollars of 580
the true value of the property in money, as adjusted under 581
division (A)(1)(d) of this section, by the amounts described in 582
divisions (A)(1)(c)(ii) to (iv) of this section. The reduction 583
is in lieu of any reduction under section 323.158 of the Revised 584
Code or division (A)(1) or (2) of this section. The reduction 585
applies to only one homestead owned and occupied by such a 586
surviving spouse. A homestead qualifies for a reduction in taxes 587
under division (A)(3) of this section for the tax year in which 588
the public service officer dies through the tax year in which 589
the surviving spouse dies or remarries. 590
(B) To provide a partial exemption, real property taxes on 591
any homestead, and manufactured home taxes on any manufactured 592
or mobile home on which a manufactured home tax is assessed 593
pursuant to division (D)(2) of section 4503.06 of the Revised 594
Code, shall be reduced for each year for which an application 595
for the reduction has been approved. The amount of the reduction 596
shall equal two and one-half per cent of the amount of taxes to 597
be levied by qualifying levies on the homestead or the 598
manufactured or mobile home after applying section 319.301 of 599
the Revised Code. For the purposes of this division, "qualifying 600
levy" has the same meaning as in section 319.302 of the Revised 601
Code. 602
(C) The reductions granted by this section do not apply to 603
special assessments or respread of assessments levied against 604
the homestead, and if there is a transfer of ownership 605
subsequent to the filing of an application for a reduction in 606
taxes, such reductions are not forfeited for such year by virtue 607
of such transfer. 608

H. B. No. 335 Page 22

(D) The reductions in taxable value referred to in this 609
section shall be applied solely as a factor for the purpose of 610
computing the reduction of taxes under this section and shall 611
not affect the total value of property in any subdivision or 612
taxing district as listed and assessed for taxation on the tax 613
lists and duplicates, or any direct or indirect limitations on 614
indebtedness of a subdivision or taxing district. If after 615
application of sections 5705.31 and 5705.32 of the Revised Code, 616
including the allocation of all levies within the ten-mill 617
limitation to debt charges to the extent therein provided, there 618
would be insufficient funds for payment of debt charges not 619
provided for by levies in excess of the ten-mill limitation, the 620
reduction of taxes provided for in sections 323.151 to 323.159 621
of the Revised Code shall be proportionately adjusted to the 622
extent necessary to provide such funds from levies within the 623
ten-mill limitation. 624
(E) No reduction shall be made on the taxes due on the 625
homestead of any person convicted of violating division (D) or 626
(E) of section 323.153 of the Revised Code for a period of three 627
years following the conviction. 628
Sec. 323.155. The tax bill prescribed under section 629
323.131 of the Revised Code shall indicate the net amount of 630
taxes due following the reductions in taxes under sections 631
319.301, 319.302, 319.303, 319.304, 323.152, and 323.16 of the 632
Revised Code. 633
Any reduction in taxes under section 323.152 of the 634
Revised Code shall be disregarded as income or resources in 635
determining eligibility for any program or calculating any 636
payment under Title LI of the Revised Code. 637
Sec. 323.158. (A) As used in this section, "qualifying 638

county" means a county to which both of the following apply: 639
(1) At least one major league professional athletic team 640
plays its home schedule in the county for the season beginning 641
in 1996; 642
(2) The majority of the electors of the county, voting at 643
an election held in 1996, approved a referendum on a resolution 644
of the board of county commissioners levying a sales and use tax 645
under sections 5739.026 and 5741.023 of the Revised Code. 646
(B) On or before December 31, 1996, the board of county 647
commissioners of a qualifying county may adopt a resolution 648
under this section. The resolution shall grant a partial real 649
property tax exemption to each homestead in the county that also 650
receives the tax reduction under division (B) of section 323.152 651
of the Revised Code. The partial exemption shall take the form 652
of the reduction by a specified percentage each year of the real 653
property taxes on the homestead. The resolution shall specify 654
the percentage, which may be any amount. The board may include 655
in the resolution a condition that the partial exemption will 656
apply only upon the receipt by the county of additional revenue 657
from a source specified in the resolution. The resolution shall 658
specify the tax year in which the partial exemption first 659
applies, which may be the tax year in which the resolution takes 660
effect as long as the resolution takes effect before the county 661
auditor certifies the tax duplicate of real and public utility 662
property for that tax year to the county treasurer. Upon 663
adopting the resolution, the board shall certify copies of it to 664
the county auditor and the tax commissioner. 665
(C) After complying with sections 319.301, 319.302, 666
319.303, 319.304, and 323.152 of the Revised Code, the county 667
auditor shall reduce the remaining sum to be levied against a 668

H. B. No. 335 Page 24
As Introduced
homestead by the percentage called for in the resolution adopted 669
under division (B) of this section. The auditor shall certify 670
the amount of taxes remaining after the reduction to the county 671
treasurer for collection as the real property taxes charged and 672
payable on the homestead. 673
(D) For each tax year, the county auditor shall certify to 674
the board of county commissioners the total amount by which real 675
property taxes were reduced under this section. At the time of 676
each semi-annual settlement of real property taxes between the 677
county auditor and county treasurer, the board of county 678
commissioners shall pay to the auditor one-half of that total 679
amount. Upon receipt of the payment, the county auditor shall 680
distribute it among the various taxing districts in the county 681
as if it had been levied, collected, and settled as real 682
property taxes. The board of county commissioners shall make the 683
payment from the county general fund or from any other county 684
revenue that may be used for that purpose. In making the 685
payment, the board may use revenue from taxes levied by the 686
county to provide additional general revenue under sections 687
5739.021 and 5741.021 of the Revised Code or to provide 688
additional revenue for the county general fund under sections 689
5739.026 and 5741.023 of the Revised Code. 690
(E) The partial exemption under this section shall not 691
directly or indirectly affect the determination of the principal 692
amount of notes that may be issued in anticipation of a tax levy 693
or the amount of securities that may be issued for any permanent 694
improvements authorized in conjunction with a tax levy. 695
(F) At any time, the board of county commissioners may 696
adopt a resolution amending or repealing the partial exemption 697
granted under this section. Upon adopting a resolution amending 698

H. B. No. 335 Page 25
As Introduced
or repealing the partial exemption, the board shall certify 699
copies of it to the county auditor and the tax commissioner. The 700
resolution shall specify the tax year in which the amendment or 701
repeal first applies, which may be the tax year in which the 702
resolution takes effect as long as the resolution takes effect 703
before the county auditor certifies the tax duplicate of real 704
and public utility property for that tax year to the county 705
treasurer. 706
(G) If a person files a late application for a tax 707
reduction under division (B) of section 323.152 of the Revised 708
Code for the preceding year, and is granted the reduction, the 709
person also shall receive the reduction under this section for 710
the preceding year. The county auditor shall credit the amount 711
of the reduction against the person's current year taxes, and 712
shall include the amount of the reduction in the amount 713
certified to the board of county commissioners under division 714
(D) of this section. 715
Sec. 323.32. As used in this section, "railroad note" 716
means a note issued pursuant to a court order in the 717
reorganization of a railroad company under section 77 of the 718
Bankruptcy Act. 719
Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the 720
contrary, with respect to all payments received in settlement of 721
claims arising from delinquent property tax charges and ordered 722
to be paid by a railroad company under a plan of reorganization 723
as ordered by a federal district court in accordance with 724
provisions of Chapter VIII of the "Federal Bankruptcy Act," 11 725
U.S.C.A. 201-208, the following provisions shall apply: 726
(A) Except as provided in division (H) of this section, 727
all of such payments shall be made payable, and delivered, to 728

H. B. No. 335 Page 26
As Introduced
the county in which the taxing district sharing in a claim for 729
delinquent taxes is located. Any notes included in such payment 730
shall be issued to such county treasurer, who shall be the 731
custodian of all of said notes, and who shall be liable therefor 732
upon the treasurer's bond until such time as said notes mature, 733
are sold, or otherwise lawfully pass from the treasurer's 734
custody. 735
(B) Upon receipt of a payment by cash or check, the county 736
treasurer shall immediately cause such funds to be paid into the 737
county treasury and credited to a special fund established for 738
this purpose, which shall be known as the "undivided bankruptcy 739
claims fund." All of such moneys so received, including any 740
earned interest, shall be credited to said fund. 741
(C) When the total claim for each county has been 742
satisfied by the receipt of cash or notes, or both, the county 743
auditor shall remit from the tax list and duplicate of real and 744
public utility property in each county, all charges appearing 745
thereon in the name of the railroad company for which such 746
payment has been made, which are delinquent and unpaid from any 747
year previous to the tax year 1977. 748
(D) At any time that funds are present in the undivided 749
bankruptcy claims fund, either upon initial settlement or at any 750
later time, the county auditor shall, forthwith, distribute by 751
auditors' warrant, such funds to the various taxing districts of 752
the county, in which the property taxes, from which the claim in 753
bankruptcy has derived, were originally charged. The funds so 754
distributed shall be apportioned among the various taxing 755
authorities within each taxing district in the same proportions 756
as the said taxes were originally levied, taking into account 757
the various rates of taxation levied for different purposes for 758

H. B. No. 335 Page 27
As Introduced
each year in which such taxes were charged and remained unpaid, 759
and any unpaid special assessments, including compound interest 760
thereon at the rate of six per cent per annum to January 1, 761
1978. 762
In making such distribution, the auditor shall, first, 763
deduct an amount equal to one per cent of the total amount to be 764
distributed, as fees for services of the county auditor and 765
treasurer in making collection and distribution of the claim in 766
bankruptcy. Such deduction shall be in lieu of all fees provided 767
for in sections 319.54 and 321.26 of the Revised Code. The 768
amount so deducted shall be credited to the general fund of the 769
county. 770
If any funds received pursuant to this section represent 771
taxes which, if collected, would have resulted from any general 772
or emergency levy which has since expired, such funds may be 773
credited to the general operating fund and expended as though 774
they are proceeds from a current levy, and if any of such funds 775
represent taxes from any current general bond retirement levy or 776
one which has since expired, said funds may be credited to the 777
current bond retirement fund and used to service any current 778
bond indebtedness, or may be credited to the general operating 779
fund of the district, if so designated by a majority of the 780
members of the taxing authority of the taxing district. 781
(E) Except as provided in division (H) of this section, 782
when, as a part of the settlement of a claim in bankruptcy of a 783
reorganized railroad company a county receives notes on behalf 784
of a taxing authority in partial payment of said claim, the 785
county treasurer shall, within a reasonable length of time, 786
notify the taxing authority of each taxing district sharing in 787
the claim that such notes are in the treasurer's custody. Within 788

H. B. No. 335 Page 28
As Introduced
sixty days of receipt of such notice, each taxing authority 789
shall decide by a resolution approved by a majority of its 790
members whether: 791
(1) The notes shall remain in custody of the county 792
treasurer, as issued, and allowed to mature according to the 793
terms presented on their face with the proceeds to be 794
distributed upon maturity pursuant to division (D) of this 795
section; or 796
(2) The railroad notes shall be exchanged for several new 797
notes in denominations equal to the proportionate share, or 798
portion thereof, of the taxing district having a share in the 799
claim in bankruptcy as determined in division (D) of this 800
section. The new notes shall be distributed, upon receipt, to 801
each taxing authority in full satisfaction of its claim or in 802
full satisfaction of the portion of its claim represented by the 803
notes so received. If notes cannot be issued in denominations 804
equal to the taxing district's proportionate share, the 805
treasurer shall certify to the taxing authority of the district 806
the amount of notes held by the treasurer on behalf of the 807
district and for which notes cannot be issued pursuant to the 808
taxing authority's decision under this subdivision. Upon receipt 809
of such certification, the taxing authority may borrow money and 810
issue notes against such certification in the same manner as is 811
provided by division (F) of this section. 812
If a taxing authority elects the option provided under 813
division (E)(1) of this section, it may at any subsequent time 814
elect instead the option provided under division (E)(2) of this 815
section by resolution approved by a majority of its members. The 816
election of the option provided under division (E)(2) of this 817
section becomes final upon receipt by the taxing authority of 818

H. B. No. 335 Page 29
As Introduced
the new notes or certification distributed by the county 819
treasurer under such division. 820
Each taxing authority shall certify a copy of any 821
resolution adopted under this division to the county treasurer 822
who shall take appropriate action as directed by each taxing 823
authority. 824
(F) A taxing authority having possession of any railroad 825
note or a treasurer's certification issued under division (E)(2) 826
of this section may, by approval of a majority of its members, 827
borrow money and issue its note in anticipation of the revenue 828
payable on maturity of the railroad note and pledge the railroad 829
note or the proceeds thereof. Such anticipation note shall 830
mature no later than the railroad note and shall be in an amount 831
no greater than seventy per cent of the face amount of said 832
railroad note. By like action a taxing authority may sell any 833
railroad note in its possession at public or private offering 834
for not less than the prevailing market price. Such a sale or 835
borrowing shall be exempt from all other requirements and 836
limitations of the Revised Code, including the requirements of 837
the Uniform Bond Law. 838
(1) If a taxing authority desires to issue delinquent tax 839
bonds pursuant to section 131.23 of the Revised Code prior to 840
either receipt of any payment from a railroad in bankruptcy or 841
utilization of the authority granted in this section, the taxing 842
authority may determine whether or not the net amount of 843
delinquent taxes unpledged for purposes of division (B)(5) of 844
section 131.23 of the Revised Code shall include all or part of 845
the delinquent taxes owed by a railroad, or, if notes have been 846

of a tax collection period becomes unavoidable, the tax 1092
commissioner, upon application by the county auditor and county 1093
treasurer, may order the time for payment of taxes to be 1094
extended if the tax commissioner determines that penalties have 1095
accrued or would otherwise accrue for reasons beyond the control 1096

(6)(a) Immediately upon receipt of any manufactured home 1117
tax duplicate from the county auditor, but not less than twenty 1118
days prior to the last date on which the first one-half taxes 1119

and mailed or delivered to each person charged on that duplicate 1122
with taxes, or to an agent designated by such person, the tax 1123
bill prescribed by the tax commissioner under division (D)(7) of 1124

punishable by imprisonment up to 30 days, a fine up to $250, or 1188
both, and in the owner having to repay the amount by which the 1189

section 4503.063 of the Revised Code, a penalty of ten per cent 1256
shall be charged against the unpaid balance of such half of the 1257
current taxes. If the total amount of all such taxes is not paid 1258
on or before the thirty-first day of July, next thereafter, or 1259
on or before the last day for payment as extended pursuant to 1260
section 4503.063 of the Revised Code, a like penalty shall be 1261
charged on the balance of the total amount of the unpaid current 1262
taxes. 1263
(b) After a valid delinquent tax contract that includes 1264
unpaid current taxes from a first-half collection period 1265
described in division (F) of this section has been entered into 1266
under section 323.31 of the Revised Code, no ten per cent 1267
penalty shall be charged against such taxes after the second- 1268
half collection period while the delinquent tax contract remains 1269
in effect. On the day a delinquent tax contract becomes void, 1270
the ten per cent penalty shall be charged against such taxes and 1271
shall equal the amount of penalty that would have been charged 1272
against unpaid current taxes outstanding on the date on which 1273
the second-half penalty would have been charged thereon under 1274
division (G)(1)(a) of this section if the contract had not been 1275

shall be for interest that accrued during the period that began 1283
on the preceding first day of December and ended on the last day 1284
of the month that included the last date such second installment 1285
could be paid without penalty. The interest shall be computed at 1286
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised 1287
Code and shall be entered as a separate item on the delinquent 1288
manufactured home tax list compiled under division (H) of this 1289
section. 1290
(b) On the first day of December beginning in 2000, the 1291
interest shall be charged against and computed on all delinquent 1292
taxes. The charge shall be for interest that accrued during the 1293
period that began on the first day of the month following the 1294
last date prescribed for the payment of the second installment 1295
of taxes in the current year and ended on the immediately 1296
preceding last day of November. The interest shall be computed 1297
at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the 1298
Revised Code and shall be entered as a separate item on the 1299
delinquent manufactured home tax list. 1300
(c) After a valid undertaking has been entered into for 1301
the payment of any delinquent taxes, no interest shall be 1302
charged against such delinquent taxes while the undertaking 1303
remains in effect in compliance with section 323.31 of the 1304
Revised Code. If a valid undertaking becomes void, interest 1305
shall be charged against the delinquent taxes for the periods 1306
that interest was not permitted to be charged while the 1307
undertaking was in effect. The interest shall be charged on the 1308
day the undertaking becomes void and shall equal the amount of 1309
interest that would have been charged against the unpaid 1310
delinquent taxes outstanding on the dates on which interest 1311
would have been charged thereon under divisions (G)(1) and (2) 1312
of this section had the undertaking not been in effect. 1313

(3) If the full amount of the taxes due at either of the 1314
times prescribed by division (F) of this section is paid within 1315
ten days after such time, the county treasurer shall waive the 1316
collection of and the county auditor shall remit one-half of the 1317
penalty provided for in this division for failure to make that 1318
payment by the prescribed time. 1319
(4) The treasurer shall compile and deliver to the county 1320
auditor a list of all tax payments the treasurer has received as 1321
provided in division (G)(3) of this section. The list shall 1322
include any information required by the auditor for the 1323
remission of the penalties waived by the treasurer. The taxes so 1324
collected shall be included in the settlement next succeeding 1325
the settlement then in process. 1326
(H)(1) The county auditor shall compile annually a 1327
"delinquent manufactured home tax list" consisting of homes the 1328
county treasurer's records indicate have taxes that were not 1329
paid within the time prescribed by divisions (D)(3) and (F) of 1330
this section, have taxes that remain unpaid from prior years, or 1331
have unpaid tax penalties or interest that have been assessed. 1332
(2) Within thirty days after the settlement under division 1333
(H)(2) of section 321.24 of the Revised Code, the county auditor 1334
shall deliver a copy of the delinquent manufactured home tax 1335
list to the county treasurer. The auditor shall update and 1336
publish the delinquent manufactured home tax list annually in 1337
the same manner as delinquent real property tax lists are 1338
published. The county auditor may apportion the cost of 1339
publishing the list among taxing districts in proportion to the 1340
amount of delinquent manufactured home taxes so published that 1341
each taxing district is entitled to receive upon collection of 1342
those taxes, or the county auditor may charge the owner of a 1343

home on the list a flat fee established under section 319.54 of 1344
the Revised Code for the cost of publishing the list and, if the 1345
fee is not paid, may place the fee upon the delinquent 1346
manufactured home tax list as a lien on the listed home, to be 1347
collected as other manufactured home taxes. 1348
(3) When taxes, penalties, or interest are charged against 1349
a person on the delinquent manufactured home tax list and are 1350
not paid within sixty days after the list is delivered to the 1351
county treasurer, the county treasurer shall, in addition to any 1352
other remedy provided by law for the collection of taxes, 1353
penalties, and interest, enforce collection of such taxes, 1354
penalties, and interest by civil action in the name of the 1355
treasurer against the owner for the recovery of the unpaid taxes 1356
following the procedures for the recovery of delinquent real 1357
property taxes in sections 323.25 to 323.28 of the Revised Code. 1358
The action may be brought in municipal or county court, provided 1359
the amount charged does not exceed the monetary limitations for 1360
original jurisdiction for civil actions in those courts. 1361
It is sufficient, having made proper parties to the suit, 1362
for the county treasurer to allege in the treasurer's bill of 1363
particulars or petition that the taxes stand chargeable on the 1364
books of the county treasurer against such person, that they are 1365
due and unpaid, and that such person is indebted in the amount 1366
of taxes appearing to be due the county. The treasurer need not 1367
set forth any other matter relating thereto. If it is found on 1368
the trial of the action that the person is indebted to the 1369
state, judgment shall be rendered in favor of the county 1370
treasurer prosecuting the action. The judgment debtor is not 1371
entitled to the benefit of any law for stay of execution or 1372
exemption of property from levy or sale on execution in the 1373
enforcement of the judgment. 1374

Upon the filing of an entry of confirmation of sale or an 1375
order of forfeiture in a proceeding brought under this division, 1376

title to the purchaser upon presentation of proof of filing of 1379
the entry of confirmation or order and, in the case of a 1380

allowed as compensation to the county auditor for the county 1385
auditor's service in assessing the taxes; two per cent shall be 1386
allowed as compensation to the county treasurer for the services 1387
the county treasurer renders as a result of the tax levied by 1388
this section. Such amounts shall be paid into the county 1389
treasury, to the credit of the county general revenue fund, on 1390
the warrant of the county auditor. Fees to be paid to the credit 1391
of the real estate assessment fund shall be collected pursuant 1392
to division (C) of section 319.54 of the Revised Code and paid 1393
into the county treasury, on the warrant of the county auditor. 1394
The balance of the taxes collected shall be distributed among 1395
the taxing subdivisions of the county in which the taxes are 1396
collected and paid in the same proportions that the amount of 1397
manufactured home tax levied by each taxing subdivision of the 1398
county in the current tax year bears to the amount of such tax 1399
levied by all such subdivisions in the county in the current tax 1400
year. The taxes levied and revenues collected under this section 1401
shall be in lieu of any general property tax and any tax levied 1402
with respect to the privilege of using or occupying a 1403
manufactured or mobile home in this state except as provided in 1404

attorney agree that an item charged on the delinquent 1410
manufactured home tax list is uncollectible, they shall certify 1411
that determination and the reasons to the county board of 1412

any manufactured or mobile home in which ownership is 1417
transferred or which first acquires situs in this state on or 1418
after January 1, 2000, and any manufactured or mobile home the 1419
owner of which has elected, under division (D)(4) of this 1420
section, to have the home taxed under division (D)(2) of this 1421
section. The true value shall include the value of the home, any 1422
additions, and any fixtures, but not any furnishings in the 1423
home. In determining the true value of a manufactured or mobile 1424
home, the auditor shall consider all facts and circumstances 1425
relating to the value of the home, including its age, its 1426
capacity to function as a residence, any obsolete 1427
characteristics, and other factors that may tend to prove its 1428
true value. 1429

subject of an arm's length sale between a willing seller and a 1431
willing buyer within a reasonable length of time prior to the 1432

the sale price of the home to be the true value for taxation 1434
purposes. 1435

(b) The sale price in an arm's length transaction between 1436
a willing seller and a willing buyer shall not be considered the 1437
true value of the home if either of the following occurred after 1438

in which real property in the county is appraised pursuant to 1444
Chapter 5713. of the Revised Code, and shall update the 1445
appraised values in the third calendar year following the 1446
appraisal. The person viewing or appraising a home may enter the 1447
home to determine by actual view any additions or fixtures that 1448
have been added since the last appraisal. In conducting the 1449
appraisals and establishing the true value, the auditor shall 1450
follow the procedures set forth for appraising real property in 1451
sections 5713.01 and 5713.03 of the Revised Code. 1452

home, the auditor shall notify the owner of the home in writing, 1457
delivered by mail or in person. The notice shall be given at 1458
least thirty days prior to the issuance of any tax bill that 1459
reflects the change. Failure to receive the notice does not 1460
invalidate any proceeding under this section. 1461

auditor under this section. The board shall hear and investigate 1472
the complaint and may take action on it as provided under 1473
sections 5715.11 to 5715.19 of the Revised Code. 1474
(c) If the county board of revision determines, pursuant 1475
to a complaint against the valuation of a manufactured or mobile 1476
home filed under this section, that the amount of taxes, 1477
assessments, or other charges paid was in excess of the amount 1478
due based on the valuation as finally determined, then the 1479
overpayment shall be refunded in the manner prescribed in 1480

any year for which a complaint is pending before the county 1483
board of revision does not abate the complaint or in any way 1484
affect the hearing and determination thereof. 1485

charge or any part thereof has been erroneously charged as a 1487
result of a clerical error as defined in section 319.35 of the 1488
Revised Code, the county auditor shall call the attention of the 1489
county board of revision to the erroneous charges. If the board 1490
finds that the taxes or other charges have been erroneously 1491

of the tax levy, expressed in mills for each one dollar of 2082
taxable value and the rate or effective rate, as applicable, in 2083
dollars for each one hundred thousand dollars of the county 2084
auditor's appraised value, as estimated by the county auditor, 2085
and, except as otherwise provided in this division, that the 2086
taxing authority will proceed with the submission of the 2087

a hearing for a date that is not less than ten and not more than 2095
thirty days after the date of certification. 2096

county commissioners, or a county department, authority, 2098
commission, office, or board designated by the board of county 2099
commissioners, shall present evidence demonstrating the 2100
necessity of the levy to the county budget commission. The 2101
county budget commission shall make a recommendation, issued on 2102
a majority vote of the commissioners. 2103

question of the tax to electors unless a copy of the county 2113
auditor's certification accompanies and any necessary county 2114
budget commission recommendation accompanies the resolutions or 2115
ordinances the taxing authority certifies to the board. Before 2116
requesting a taxing authority to submit a tax levy, any agency 2117
or authority authorized to make that request shall first request 2118
the certification from the county auditor provided under this 2119
section. 2120
(4) This division is supplemental to, and not in 2121
derogation of, any similar requirement governing the 2122
certification by the county auditor of the tax valuation of a 2123
subdivision or necessary tax rates for the purposes of the 2124
submission of the question of a tax in excess of the ten-mill 2125
limitation, including sections 133.18 and 5705.195 of the 2126
Revised Code. 2127
(C) All taxes levied on property shall be extended on the 2128

Not more than one reserve balance account may be 2156
established for each of the purposes permitted under divisions 2157
(A)(2) and (3) of this section. Money to the credit of a reserve 2158
balance account may be expended only for the purpose for which 2159
the account was established. 2160
A reserve balance account established for the purpose 2161
described in division (A)(1) of this section may be established 2162
in the general fund or in one or more special funds for 2163
operating purposes of the subdivision. The amount of money to be 2164
reserved in such an account in any fiscal year shall not exceed 2165

year to the fund in which the account is established, or, in the 2167
case of a reserve balance account of a county or of a township, 2168

H. B. No. 335 Page 76

5705.29 of the Revised Code, any reserve balance in an account 2172
established under division (A)(1) of this section shall not be 2173
considered part of the unencumbered balance or revenue of the 2174

sound actuarial principles. 2192
A taxing authority of a subdivision, by resolution or 2193
ordinance, may rescind a reserve balance account established 2194

of accumulating resources for the payment of accumulated sick 2201
leave and vacation leave, and for payments in lieu of taking 2202
compensatory time off, upon the termination of employment or the 2203
retirement of officers and employees of the subdivision. The 2204
special revenue fund may also accumulate resources for payment 2205
of salaries during any fiscal year when the number of pay 2206
periods exceeds the usual and customary number of pay periods. 2207
Notwithstanding sections 5705.14, 5705.15, and 5705.16 of the 2208
Revised Code, the taxing authority, by resolution or ordinance, 2209
may transfer money to the special revenue fund from any other 2210
fund of the subdivision from which such payments may lawfully be 2211
made. The taxing authority, by resolution or ordinance, may 2212
rescind a special revenue fund established under this division. 2213
If a special revenue fund is rescinded, money that has 2214
accumulated in the fund shall be transferred to the fund or 2215
funds from which the money originally was transferred. 2216
(C) A taxing authority of a subdivision, by resolution or 2217
ordinance, may establish a capital projects fund for the purpose 2218
of accumulating resources for the acquisition, construction, or 2219
improvement of fixed assets of the subdivision. For the purposes 2220
of this section, "fixed assets" includes motor vehicles. More 2221
than one capital projects fund may be established and may exist 2222
at any time. The ordinance or resolution shall identify the 2223
source of the money to be used to acquire, construct, or improve 2224
the fixed assets identified in the resolution or ordinance, the 2225
amount of money to be accumulated for that purpose, the period 2226
of time over which that amount is to be accumulated, and the 2227
fixed assets that the taxing authority intends to acquire, 2228
construct, or improve with the money to be accumulated in the 2229

fund. 2230
A taxing authority of a subdivision shall not accumulate 2231
money in a capital projects fund for more than ten years after 2232
the resolution or ordinance establishing the fund is adopted. If 2233
the subdivision has not entered into a contract for the 2234
acquisition, construction, or improvement of fixed assets for 2235
which money was accumulated in such a fund before the end of 2236
that ten-year period, the fiscal officer of the subdivision 2237
shall transfer all money in the fund to the fund or funds from 2238
which that money originally was transferred or the fund that 2239
originally was intended to receive the money. 2240
A taxing authority of a subdivision, by resolution or 2241
ordinance, may rescind a capital projects fund. If a capital 2242
projects fund is rescinded, money that has accumulated in the 2243
fund shall be transferred to the fund or funds from which the 2244
money originally was transferred. 2245
Notwithstanding sections 5705.14, 5705.15, and 5705.16 of 2246
the Revised Code, the taxing authority of a subdivision, by 2247
resolution or ordinance, may transfer money to the capital 2248
projects fund from any other fund of the subdivision that may 2249
lawfully be used for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, or 2250
improving the fixed assets identified in the resolution or 2251
ordinance. 2252
Sec. 5705.192. (A) For the purposes of this section only, 2253
"taxing authority" includes a township board of park 2254
commissioners appointed under section 511.18 of the Revised 2255

of the section of the Revised Code under which the authority is 2259
granted, except a school district emergency levy proposed 2260
pursuant to sections 5705.194 to 5705.197 of the Revised Code. 2261
The taxing authority may propose to replace the existing levy in 2262
its entirety at the rate at which it is authorized to be levied; 2263
may propose to replace a portion of the existing levy at a 2264
lesser rate; or may propose to replace the existing levy in its 2265
entirety and increase the rate at which it is levied. If the 2266
taxing authority proposes to replace an existing levy, the 2267
proposed levy shall be called a replacement levy and shall be so 2268
designated on the ballot. Except as otherwise provided in this 2269
division, a replacement levy shall be limited to the purpose of 2270
the existing levy, and shall appear separately on the ballot 2271
from, and shall not be conjoined with, the renewal of any other 2272
existing levy. In the case of an existing school district levy 2273
imposed under section 5705.21 of the Revised Code for the 2274
purpose specified in division (F) of section 5705.19 of the 2275
Revised Code, or in the case of an existing school district levy 2276
imposed under section 5705.217 of the Revised Code for the 2277
acquisition, construction, enlargement, renovation, and 2278
financing of permanent improvements, the replacement for that 2279
existing levy may be for the same purpose or for the purpose of 2280
general permanent improvements as defined in section 5705.21 of 2281
the Revised Code. The replacement for an existing levy imposed 2282
under division (L) of section 5705.19 or section 5705.222 of the 2283
Revised Code may be for any purpose authorized for a levy 2284
imposed under section 5705.222 of the Revised Code. 2285
The resolution proposing a replacement levy shall specify 2286
the purpose of the levy; its proposed rate expressed in mills 2287

calendar year in which the levy will be due; and the term of the 2295
levy, expressed in years or, if applicable, that it will be 2296
levied for a continuing period of time. 2297
The sections of the Revised Code governing the maximum 2298
rate and term of the existing levy, the contents of the 2299
resolution that proposed the levy, the adoption of the 2300
resolution, the arrangements for the submission of the question 2301
of the levy, and notice of the election also govern the 2302
respective provisions of the proposal to replace the existing 2303
levy, except as provided in divisions (B)(1) to (5) of this 2304
section: 2305
(1) In the case of an existing school district levy that 2306
is imposed under section 5705.21 of the Revised Code for the 2307
purpose specified in division (F) of section 5705.19 of the 2308
Revised Code or under section 5705.217 of the Revised Code for 2309
the acquisition, construction, enlargement, renovation, and 2310
financing of permanent improvements, and that is to be replaced 2311
by a levy for general permanent improvements, the term of the 2312
replacement levy may be for a continuing period of time. 2313
(2) The date on which the election is held shall be as 2314
follows: 2315
(a) For the replacement of a levy with a fixed term of 2316
years, the date of the general election held during the last 2317
year the existing levy may be extended on the real and public 2318
utility property tax list and duplicate, or the date of any 2319

the year the levy to be replaced is first approved by the 2323
electors, except that only one election on the question of 2324
replacing the levy may be held during any calendar year. 2325
The failure by the electors to approve a proposal to 2326
replace a levy imposed for a continuing period of time does not 2327
terminate the existing continuing levy. 2328
(3) In the case of an existing school district levy 2329
imposed under division (B) of section 5705.21, division (C) of 2330
section 5705.212, or division (J) of section 5705.218 of the 2331
Revised Code, the rates allocated to the qualifying school 2332

AGAINST THE TAX LEVY
If the replacement levy is proposed by a qualifying school 2356
district to replace an existing tax levied under division (B) of 2357
section 5705.21, division (C)(1) of section 5705.212, or 2358
division (J) of section 5705.218 of the Revised Code, the form 2359

If the proposal is to replace an existing levy and 2363
increase the rate of the existing levy, the form of the ballot 2364
shall be changed by adding the words "__________ mills of an 2365
existing levy and an increase of __________ mills, to 2366
constitute" after the words "a replacement of." If the proposal 2367
is to replace only a portion of an existing levy, the form of 2368
the ballot shall be changed by adding the words "a portion of an 2369
existing levy, being a reduction of __________ mills, to 2370
constitute" after the words "a replacement of." If the existing 2371
levy is imposed under division (B) of section 5705.21, division 2372
(C)(1) of section 5705.212, or division (J) of section 5705.218 2373

If the tax is to be placed on the tax list of the current 2377
tax year, the form of the ballot shall be modified by adding at 2378
the end of the form the phrase ", commencing in __________ 2379
(first year the replacement tax is to be levied), first due in 2380
calendar year __________ (first calendar year in which the tax 2381
shall be due)." 2382
The question covered by the resolution shall be submitted 2383
as a separate proposition, but may be printed on the same ballot 2384
with any other proposition submitted at the same election, other 2385
than the election of officers. More than one such question may 2386
be submitted at the same election. 2387
(D) Two or more existing levies, or any portion of those 2388
levies, may be combined into one replacement levy, so long as 2389
all of the existing levies are for the same purpose and either 2390
all are due to expire the same year or all are for a continuing 2391
period of time. The question of combining all or portions of 2392
those existing levies into the replacement levy shall appear as 2393
one ballot proposition before the electors. If the electors 2394
approve the ballot proposition, all or the stated portions of 2395
the existing levies are replaced by one replacement levy. 2396
(E) A levy approved in excess of the ten-mill limitation 2397
under this section shall be certified to the tax commissioner. 2398
In the first year of a levy approved under this section, the 2399
levy shall be extended on the tax lists after the February 2400
settlement succeeding the election at which the levy was 2401
approved. If the levy is to be placed on the tax lists of the 2402
current year, as specified in the resolution providing for its 2403
submission, the result of the election shall be certified 2404
immediately after the canvass by the board of elections to the 2405

and certify it to the county auditor, who shall extend it on the 2407
tax lists for collection. After the first year, the levy shall 2408
be included in the annual tax budget that is certified to the 2409
county budget commission. 2410
If notes are authorized to be issued in anticipation of 2411
the proceeds of the existing levy, notes may be issued in 2412
anticipation of the proceeds of the replacement levy, and such 2413
issuance is subject to the terms and limitations governing the 2414
issuance of notes in anticipation of the proceeds of the 2415
existing levy. 2416
(F) This section does not authorize a tax to be levied in 2417
any year after the year in which revenue is not needed for the 2418
purpose for which the tax is levied. 2419
Sec. 5705.194. The board of education of any city, local, 2420
exempted village, cooperative education, or joint vocational 2421
school district at any time may declare by resolution that the 2422
revenue that will be raised by all tax levies which the district 2423
is authorized to impose, when combined with state and federal 2424
revenues, will be insufficient to provide for the emergency 2425
requirements of the school district or to avoid an operating 2426
deficit, and that it is therefore necessary to levy an 2427
additional tax in excess of the ten-mill limitation for the 2428
current expenses of the district. The resolution shall be 2429
confined to a single purpose and shall specify that purpose. If 2430
the levy is proposed to renew all or a portion of the proceeds 2431
derived from one or more existing levies imposed pursuant to 2432
this section, it shall be called a renewal levy and shall be so 2433
designated on the ballot, except that an existing levy may not 2434
be renewed under this section if the purpose of that levy is to 2435

avoid an operating deficit or to provide for the emergency 2436
requirements of the school district. If two or more existing 2437
levies are to be included in a single renewal levy but are not 2438
scheduled to expire in the same year, the resolution shall 2439
specify that the existing levies to be renewed shall not be 2440
levied after the year preceding the year in which the renewal 2441
levy is first imposed. Notwithstanding the original purpose of 2442
any one or more existing levies that are to be in any single 2443
renewal levy, the purpose of the renewal levy may be either to 2444
avoid an operating deficit or to provide for the emergency 2445
requirements of the school district. The resolution shall 2446
further specify the amount of money it is necessary to raise for 2447
the specified purpose for each calendar year the millage is to 2448
be imposed; if a renewal levy, whether the levy is to renew all, 2449
or a portion of, the proceeds derived from one or more existing 2450
levies; and the number of years in which the millage is to be in 2451
effect, which may include a levy upon the current year's tax 2452
list. The number of years may be any number not exceeding ten. 2453
The question shall be submitted at a special election on a 2454
date specified in the resolution. The date shall not be earlier 2455
than eighty days after the adoption and certification of the 2456
resolution to the county auditor and shall be consistent with 2457
the requirements of section 3501.01 of the Revised Code. A 2458
resolution for a renewal levy shall not be placed on the ballot 2459
unless the question is submitted on a date on which a special 2460
election may be held under division (D) of section 3501.01 of 2461
the Revised Code, except for the first Tuesday after the first 2462
Monday in August, during the last year the levy to be renewed 2463
may be extended on the real and public utility property tax list 2464
and duplicate, or at any election held in the ensuing year, 2465
except that if the resolution proposes renewing two or more 2466

the general or primary election held during the last year at 2468
least one of the levies to be renewed may be extended on that 2469
list and duplicate, or at any election held during the ensuing 2470
year. For purposes of this section and sections 5705.197 and 2471
5705.199 of the Revised Code, a levy shall be considered to be 2472
an "existing levy" through the year following the last year it 2473
can be placed on the real and public utility property tax list 2474
and duplicate. 2475
The submission of questions to the electors under this 2476
section is subject to the limitation on the number of election 2477
dates established by section 5705.214 of the Revised Code. 2478
The resolution shall go into immediate effect upon its 2479
passage, and no publication of the resolution shall be necessary 2480
other than that provided for in the notice of election. A copy 2481
of the resolution shall immediately after its passing be 2482
certified to the county auditor of the proper county. Section 2483
5705.195 of the Revised Code shall govern the arrangements for 2484
the submission of questions to the electors under this section 2485
and other matters concerning the election. Publication of notice 2486
of the election shall be made in one newspaper of general 2487
circulation in the county once a week for two consecutive weeks, 2488
or as provided in section 7.16 of the Revised Code, prior to the 2489

all tax levies that the district is authorized to impose, when 2564

shall be in a specified amount of money equal to the aggregate 2575
annual dollar amount of proceeds derived from the levy or 2576
levies, or portion thereof, being substituted. 2577
(2) In each subsequent year the levy is in effect, the 2578

as defined in section 319.301 of the Revised Code, multiplied by 2586
the annual levy, expressed in mills for each one dollar of 2587
taxable value, that was required to produce the annual dollar 2588
amount of the levy under this section in the prior year; 2589
provided, that the amount under division (A)(2)(b) of this 2590
section shall not be less than zero. 2591

specify the annual dollar amount the levy is to produce in its 2593
initial year; the first calendar year in which the levy will be 2594
due; and the term of the levy expressed in years, which may be 2595
any number not exceeding ten, or for a continuing period of 2596
time. The resolution shall specify the date of holding the 2597
election, which shall not be earlier than ninety days after 2598
certification of the resolution to the board of elections, and 2599

levied after the year preceding the year in which the substitute 2605
levy is first imposed. 2606
The resolution shall go into immediate effect upon its 2607

the submission of the question and other matters concerning the 2614
notice of election and the election, except as may be provided 2615
otherwise in this section. 2616

any amount in a reserve balance account that it determines to be 2960
unreasonable as unencumbered and as revenue for the purposes of 2961
section 5747.51 of the Revised Code and may take such amounts 2962

the taxing authority is a board of education that has elected to 2977
include projections pursuant to division (E) of section 5705.391 2978
of the Revised Code, shall examine such projections. Using the 2979
budget and, if applicable, included projections, the budget 2980
commission shall ascertain the total amount proposed to be 2981
raised in the county for the purposes of each subdivision and 2982
other taxing units in the county and the need for those amounts. 2983
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the county budget 2984
commission may reduce the amount to be raised by any levy 2985

The commission shall ascertain that the following levies 2987
have been properly authorized and, if so authorized, shall 2988
approve them without modification: 2989
(A) All levies in excess of the ten-mill limitation; in 2990
the first year they are levied, unless the levy is the renewal 2991
of an existing tax or the subdivision or taxing unit requests an 2992
amount requiring a lower rate for the succeeding fiscal year. 2993
Such a request for an amount requiring a lower rate applies only 2994
to the succeeding fiscal year unless the subdivision or taxing 2995

levies that remain necessary to pay notes issued for emergency 2999
purposes; 3000
(C) The levies prescribed by division (B) of sections 3001
742.33 and 742.34 of the Revised Code; 3002
(D) Except as otherwise provided in this division, a 3003
minimum levy within the ten-mill limitation for the current 3004
expense and debt service of each subdivision or taxing unit, 3005
which shall equal two-thirds of the average levy for current 3006
expenses and debt service allotted within the fifteen-mill 3007
limitation to such subdivision or taxing unit during the last 3008
five years the fifteen-mill limitation was in effect unless such 3009
subdivision or taxing unit requests an amount requiring a lower 3010
rate. Except for the succeeding fiscal year, or if it expressed 3011
its intent to forgo collections from such a levy under division 3012
(E) of section 5705.29 of the Revised Code. Such a request for 3013
an amount requiring a lower rate applies only to the succeeding 3014
fiscal year unless the subdivision or taxing unit expressly 3015
states that the request is permanent. 3016
Except as provided in section 5705.312 of the Revised 3017
Code, if the levies required in divisions (B) and (C) of this 3018
section for the subdivision or taxing unit equal or exceed the 3019
entire minimum levy of the subdivision as fixed, the minimum 3020
levies of the other subdivisions or taxing units shall be 3021
reduced by the commission to provide for the levies and an 3022
operating levy for the subdivision. Such additional levy shall 3023
be deducted from the minimum levies of each of the other 3024
subdivisions or taxing units, but the operating levy for a 3025

this section have been provided for. 3029
If a municipal corporation and a township have entered 3030
into an annexation agreement under section 709.192 of the 3031
Revised Code in which they agree to reallocate their shares of 3032
the minimum levies established under this division and if that 3033
annexation agreement is submitted along with the annual tax 3034
budget of both the township and the municipal corporation, then, 3035
when determining the minimum levy under this division, the 3036
auditor shall allocate, to the extent possible, the minimum levy 3037
for that municipal corporation and township in accordance with 3038
their annexation agreement. 3039
(E) The levies prescribed by section 3709.29 of the 3040
Revised Code. 3041
Divisions (A) to (E)(D) of this section are mandatory, and 3042
commissions shall be without discretion to reduce such minimum 3043
levies except as provided in such divisions. 3044
If any debt charge is omitted from the budget, the 3045
commission shall include it therein. 3046

within the ten-mill limitation in any manner other than 3056
described in division (A) of this section that would result in 3057
an increase in the amount of real property taxes levied by the 3058
board in the tax year the change takes effect, the board shall 3059
hold a public hearing solely on the proposal before adopting a 3060
resolution to implement the proposal. The board shall publish 3061
notice of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in 3062
the school district once a week for two consecutive weeks or as 3063
provided in section 7.16 of the Revised Code. The second 3064
publication shall be not less than ten nor more than thirty days 3065
before the date of the hearing, and the notice shall include the 3066
date, time, place, and subject of the hearing, and a statement 3067
that the change proposed by the board may result in an increase 3068
in the amount of real property taxes levied by the board. At the 3069
time the board submits the notice for publication, the board 3070
shall send a copy of the notice to the auditor of the county 3071
where the school district is located or, if the school district 3072
is located in more than one county, to the auditor of each of 3073
those counties. 3074
Sec. 5705.32. (A) The county budget commission shall 3075
adjust the estimated amounts required from the general property 3076
tax for each fund, as shown by the tax budgets or other 3077
information required to be provided under section 5705.281 of 3078
the Revised Code, so as to bring the tax levies required 3079
therefor within the limitations specified in sections 5705.01 to 3080
5705.47 of the Revised Code, for such levies, but no levy shall 3081
be reduced pursuant to this division below a minimum fixed by 3082
law. The commission may revise and adjust the estimate of 3083
balances and receipts from all sources for each fund and shall 3084
determine the total appropriations that may be made therefrom. 3085

H. B. No. 335 Page 107
As Introduced
If a taxing unit declared its intent to forgo collections under 3086
division (E) of section 5705.29 of the Revised Code, the 3087
commission shall adjust the rate of each levy as required to 3088
result in that reduction in collections. 3089
(B) If, as shown by a tax budget or other information 3090
required pursuant to section 5705.281 of the Revised Code, the 3091
unencumbered balance estimated to remain in any fund at the end 3092
of the current fiscal year exceeds thirty per cent of the total 3093
estimated expenses from that fund through the end of the current 3094
fiscal year, the county budget commission shall hold a public 3095
hearing to consider adjustments to any property tax levies, the 3096
receipts of which are deposited into the fund. 3097
The hearing shall be held to determine whether those 3098
levies should be adjusted for the succeeding fiscal year to 3099
avoid excessive collections. The taxing authority for whose 3100
benefit the tax is levied shall be given the opportunity, at the 3101
public hearing, to present its position as to whether the levy 3102
should be adjusted and to provide evidence supporting that 3103
position. 3104
If, after the public hearing, the commission determines 3105
that one or more levies should be adjusted to avoid excessive 3106
collections, the commission may reduce the levy for the 3107
following fiscal year by an amount, or a rate the results in an 3108
amount, that is up to or equal to the amount by which the 3109
estimated fiscal-year-end unencumbered balance in the fund 3110
exceeds thirty per cent of the estimated fiscal-year-end 3111
expenditures from the fund. But, no levy may be reduced to a 3112
level that would cause a school district subject to division (A) 3113
of section 3317.01 of the Revised Code to levy less than twenty 3114
mills for current operating expenses as required by that 3115

or division (D) of section 5705.31 of the Revised Code. 3117
(B)(C) The commission shall fix the amount of the county 3118
public library fund to be distributed to each board of public 3119
library trustees that has qualified under section 5705.28 of the 3120
Revised Code for participation in the proceeds of such fund. The 3121
amount paid to all libraries in the county from such fund shall 3122
never be a smaller per cent of the fund than the average of the 3123
percentages of the county's classified taxes that were 3124
distributed to libraries in 1982, 1983, and 1984, as determined 3125
by the county auditor. The commission shall base the amount for 3126
distribution on the needs of such library for the construction 3127
of new library buildings, parts of buildings, improvements, 3128
operation, maintenance, or other expenses. In determining the 3129
needs of each library board of trustees, and in calculating the 3130
amount to be distributed to any library board of trustees on the 3131
basis of its needs, the commission shall make no reduction in 3132
its allocation from the fund on account of additional revenues 3133
realized by a library from increased taxes or service charges 3134
voted by its electorate, from revenues received through federal 3135
or state grants, projects, or programs, or from grants from 3136
private sources. 3137
(C)(D) Notwithstanding the fact that alternative methods 3138
of financing such needs are available, after fixing the amount 3139
to be distributed to libraries, the commission shall fix the 3140
amount, if any, of the county public library fund to be 3141
distributed to each board of township park commissioners, the 3142
county, and each municipal corporation in accordance with the 3143
following: 3144
(1) Each municipal corporation in the county shall receive 3145

H. B. No. 335 Page 109

a per cent of the remainder that equals the per cent that the 3146
county auditor determines the classified property taxes 3147
originating in such municipal corporation in 1984 were of the 3148
total of all of the county's classified property taxes in 1984. 3149
The commission may deduct from this amount any amount that the 3150
budget commission allows to the board of township park 3151
commissioners of a township park district, the boundaries of 3152
which are coextensive with or contained within the boundaries of 3153
the municipal corporation. 3154
(2) The county shall receive a per cent of the remainder 3155
that equals the per cent that the county auditor determines the 3156
classified property taxes originating outside of the boundaries 3157
of municipal corporations in the county in 1984 were of the 3158
total of all of the county's classified property taxes in 1984. 3159
The commission may deduct from this amount any amount that the 3160
budget commission allows to the board of township park 3161
commissioners of a township park district, the boundaries of 3162
which are not coextensive with or contained within those of any 3163
municipal corporation in the county. 3164
(D)(E) The commission shall separately set forth the 3165
amounts fixed and determined under divisions (B)(C) and (C)(D) 3166
of this section in the "official certificate of estimated 3167
resources," as provided in section 5705.35 of the Revised Code, 3168
and separately certify such amount to the county auditor who 3169
shall be guided thereby in the distribution of the county public 3170
library fund for and during the fiscal year. In determining such 3171
amounts, the commission shall be guided by the estimate 3172
certified by the tax commissioner and presented by the auditor 3173
under section 5705.31 of the Revised Code, as to the total 3174
amount of revenue to be received in the county public library 3175
fund during such fiscal year. 3176

county commissioners, and township park commissioners eligible 3181

time, place, and agenda for the meeting. Any legislative 3183
authority or board entitled to notice under this division may 3184
designate an officer or employee of such legislative authority 3185
or board to whom the commission shall deliver the notice. 3186
(2) Before the final determination of the amount to be 3187
allotted to each subdivision from any source, the commission 3188
shall permit representatives of each subdivision and of each 3189
board of public library trustees to appear before it to explain 3190
its financial needs. 3191
(F)(G) If any public library receives and expends any 3192
funds allocated to it under this section for the construction of 3193
new library buildings or parts of buildings, such library shall 3194
be free and open to the inhabitants of the county in which it is 3195
located. Any board of library trustees that receives funds under 3196
this section and section 5747.48 of the Revised Code shall have 3197

(B) In lieu of the method of apportionment of the county 3225
public library fund provided by division (C)(D) of section 3226
5705.32 of the Revised Code, the county budget commission may 3227
provide for the apportionment of the fund under an alternative 3228

approval for an alternative method of apportionment, the board 3243
of county commissioners, boards of township trustees, and 3244
legislative authorities of municipal corporations subdivisions 3245

shall be apportioned among the subdivisions eligible to 3256
participate in the fund, commencing in the ensuing calendar 3257

levy a tax at the same rate pursuant to section 5741.023 of the 4147
Revised Code. 4148
The additional tax levied by the county shall be collected 4149
pursuant to section 5739.025 of the Revised Code. 4150
Any tax levied pursuant to this section is subject to the 4151

certified copy of a resolution required by division (A) of this 4157
section, or from the board of elections a notice of the results 4158
of an election required by division (D)(1), (2)(a), (b), or (c) 4159
of this section, the tax commissioner shall provide notice of a 4160
tax rate change in a manner that is reasonably accessible to all 4161
affected vendors. The commissioner shall provide this notice at 4162
least sixty days prior to the effective date of the rate change. 4163

notice will be provided. 4165
Sec. 5747.51. (A) On or before the twenty-fifth day of 4166
July of each year, the tax commissioner shall make and certify 4167
to the county auditor of each county an estimate of the amount 4168
of the local government fund to be allocated to the undivided 4169
local government fund of each county for the ensuing calendar 4170
year, adjusting the total as required to account for 4171
subdivisions receiving local government funds under section 4172
5747.502 of the Revised Code. 4173
(B) At each annual regular session of the county budget 4174
commission convened pursuant to section 5705.27 of the Revised 4175
Code, each auditor shall present to the commission the 4176
certificate of the commissioner, the annual tax budget and 4177
estimates, and the records showing the action of the commission 4178
in its last preceding regular session. The commission, after 4179
extending to the representatives of each subdivision an 4180
opportunity to be heard, under oath administered by any member 4181
of the commission, and considering all the facts and information 4182
presented to it by the auditor, shall determine the amount of 4183
the undivided local government fund needed by and to be 4184
apportioned to each subdivision for current operating expenses, 4185
as shown in the tax budget of the subdivision. This 4186
determination shall be made pursuant to divisions (C) to (I) of 4187

H. B. No. 335 Page 144

this section, unless the commission has provided for a formula 4188
pursuant to section 5747.53 of the Revised Code. The 4189
commissioner shall reduce the amount of funds from the undivided 4190
local government fund to a subdivision required to receive 4191
reduced funds under section 5747.502 of the Revised Code. 4192
Nothing in this section prevents the budget commission, 4193
for the purpose of apportioning the undivided local government 4194
fund, from inquiring into the claimed needs of any subdivision 4195
as stated in its tax budget, or from adjusting claimed needs to 4196
reflect actual needs. For the purposes of this section, "current 4197
operating expenses" means the lawful expenditures of a 4198
subdivision, except those for permanent improvements and except 4199
payments for interest, sinking fund, and retirement of bonds, 4200
notes, and certificates of indebtedness of the subdivision. 4201
(C) The commission shall determine the combined total of 4202
the estimated expenditures, including transfers, from the 4203
general fund and any special funds other than special funds 4204
established for road and bridge; street construction, 4205
maintenance, and repair; state highway improvement; and gas, 4206
water, sewer, and electric public utilities operated by a 4207
subdivision, as shown in the subdivision's tax budget for the 4208
ensuing calendar year. 4209
(D) From the combined total of expenditures calculated 4210
pursuant to division (C) of this section, the commission shall 4211
deduct the following expenditures, if included in these funds in 4212
the tax budget: 4213
(1) Expenditures for permanent improvements as defined in 4214
division (E) of section 5705.01 of the Revised Code; 4215
(2) In the case of counties and townships, transfers to 4216

transfers to the street construction, maintenance, and repair 4218
fund and the state highway improvement fund; 4219
(3) Expenditures for the payment of debt charges; 4220
(4) Expenditures for the payment of judgments. 4221
(E) In addition to the deductions made pursuant to 4222
division (D) of this section, revenues accruing to the general 4223
fund and any special fund considered under division (C) of this 4224
section from the following sources shall be deducted from the 4225
combined total of expenditures calculated pursuant to division 4226
(C) of this section: 4227
(1) Taxes levied within the ten-mill limitation, as 4228
defined in section 5705.02 of the Revised Code; 4229
(2) The budget commission allocation of estimated county 4230
public library fund revenues to be distributed pursuant to 4231
section 5747.48 of the Revised Code; 4232
(3) Estimated unencumbered balances as shown on the tax 4233
budget as of the thirty-first day of December of the current 4234
year in the general fund, but not any estimated balance in any 4235
special fund considered in division (C) of this section; 4236
(4) Revenue, including transfers, shown in the general 4237
fund and any special funds other than special funds established 4238
for road and bridge; street construction, maintenance, and 4239
repair; state highway improvement; and gas, water, sewer, and 4240
electric public utilities, from all other sources except those 4241
that a subdivision receives from an additional tax or service 4242
charge voted by its electorate or receives from special 4243
assessment or revenue bond collection. For the purposes of this 4244
division, where the charter of a municipal corporation prohibits 4245

H. B. No. 335 Page 146
As Introduced
the levy of an income tax, an income tax levied by the 4246
legislative authority of such municipal corporation pursuant to 4247
an amendment of the charter of that municipal corporation to 4248
authorize such a levy represents an additional tax voted by the 4249
electorate of that municipal corporation. For the purposes of 4250
this division, any measure adopted by a board of county 4251
commissioners pursuant to section 322.02, 4504.02, or 5739.021 4252
of the Revised Code, including those measures upheld by the 4253
electorate in a referendum conducted pursuant to section 4254
322.021, 4504.021, or 5739.022 of the Revised Code, shall not be 4255
considered an additional tax voted by the electorate. 4256
Subject to division (F)(G) of section 5705.29 of the 4257
Revised Code, money in a reserve balance account established by 4258
a county, township, or municipal corporation under section 4259
5705.13 of the Revised Code shall not be considered an 4260
unencumbered balance or revenue under division (E)(3) or (4) of 4261
this section. Money in a reserve balance account established by 4262
a township under section 5705.132 of the Revised Code shall not 4263
be considered an unencumbered balance or revenue under division 4264
(E)(3) or (4) of this section. 4265
If a county, township, or municipal corporation has 4266
created and maintains a nonexpendable trust fund under section 4267
5705.131 of the Revised Code, the principal of the fund, and any 4268
additions to the principal arising from sources other than the 4269
reinvestment of investment earnings arising from such a fund, 4270
shall not be considered an unencumbered balance or revenue under 4271
division (E)(3) or (4) of this section. Only investment earnings 4272
arising from investment of the principal or investment of such 4273
additions to principal may be considered an unencumbered balance 4274
or revenue under those divisions. 4275

(F) The total expenditures calculated pursuant to division 4276
(C) of this section, less the deductions authorized in divisions 4277
(D) and (E) of this section, shall be known as the "relative 4278
need" of the subdivision, for the purposes of this section. 4279
(G) The budget commission shall total the relative need of 4280
all participating subdivisions in the county, and shall compute 4281
a relative need factor by dividing the total estimate of the 4282
undivided local government fund by the total relative need of 4283
all participating subdivisions. 4284
(H) The relative need of each subdivision shall be 4285
multiplied by the relative need factor to determine the 4286
proportionate share of the subdivision in the undivided local 4287
government fund of the county; provided, that the maximum 4288
proportionate share of a county shall not exceed the following 4289
maximum percentages of the total estimate of the undivided local 4290
government fund governed by the relationship of the percentage 4291
of the population of the county that resides within municipal 4292
corporations within the county to the total population of the 4293
county as reported in the reports on population in Ohio by the 4294
department of development as of the twentieth day of July of the 4295

than eighty-one per cent
D Eighty-one per cent or more Thirty per cent
Where the proportionate share of the county exceeds the 4299
limitations established in this division, the budget commission 4300
shall adjust the proportionate shares determined pursuant to 4301
this division so that the proportionate share of the county does 4302
not exceed these limitations, and it shall increase the 4303
proportionate shares of all other subdivisions on a pro rata 4304
basis. In counties having a population of less than one hundred 4305
thousand, not less than ten per cent shall be distributed to the 4306
townships therein. 4307
(I) The proportionate share of each subdivision in the 4308
undivided local government fund determined pursuant to division 4309
(H) of this section for any calendar year shall not be less than 4310
the product of the average of the percentages of the undivided 4311
local government fund of the county as apportioned to that 4312
subdivision for the calendar years 1968, 1969, and 1970, 4313
multiplied by the total amount of the undivided local government 4314
fund of the county apportioned pursuant to former section 4315
5739.23 of the Revised Code for the calendar year 1970. For the 4316
purposes of this division, the total apportioned amount for the 4317
calendar year 1970 shall be the amount actually allocated to the 4318
county in 1970 from the state collected intangible tax as levied 4319
by section 5707.03 of the Revised Code and distributed pursuant 4320
to section 5725.24 of the Revised Code, plus the amount received 4321
by the county in the calendar year 1970 pursuant to division (B) 4322
(1) of former section 5739.21 of the Revised Code, and 4323
distributed pursuant to former section 5739.22 of the Revised 4324
Code. If the total amount of the undivided local government fund 4325

for any calendar year is less than the amount of the undivided 4326
local government fund apportioned pursuant to former section 4327
5739.23 of the Revised Code for the calendar year 1970, the 4328
minimum amount guaranteed to each subdivision for that calendar 4329
year pursuant to this division shall be reduced on a basis 4330
proportionate to the amount by which the amount of the undivided 4331
local government fund for that calendar year is less than the 4332
amount of the undivided local government fund apportioned for 4333
the calendar year 1970. 4334
(J) On the basis of such apportionment, the county auditor 4335
shall compute the percentage share of each such subdivision in 4336
the undivided local government fund and shall at the same time 4337
certify to the tax commissioner the percentage share of the 4338
county as a subdivision. No payment shall be made from the 4339
undivided local government fund, except in accordance with such 4340
percentage shares. 4341
Within ten days after the budget commission has made its 4342
apportionment, whether conducted pursuant to section 5747.51 or 4343
5747.53 of the Revised Code, the auditor shall publish a list of 4344
the subdivisions and the amount each is to receive from the 4345
undivided local government fund and the percentage share of each 4346
subdivision, in a newspaper or newspapers of countywide 4347
circulation, and send a copy of such allocation to the tax 4348
commissioner. 4349
The county auditor shall also send a copy of such 4350
allocation by ordinary or electronic mail to the fiscal officer 4351
of each subdivision entitled to participate in the allocation of 4352
the undivided local government fund of the county. This copy 4353
shall constitute the official notice of the commission action 4354
referred to in section 5705.37 of the Revised Code. 4355

trustees so requests the legislative authority of the municipal 4362
corporation, shall participate in the money apportioned to such 4363
municipal corporation from the total local government fund, 4364
however created and constituted, in such amount as requested by 4365
the board of trustees, provided such sum does not exceed nine 4366
per cent of the total amount paid to the municipal corporation. 4367

required by sections 5747.50 to 5747.55 of the Revised Code or 4369
by the rules issued by the tax commissioner, the auditor of 4370
state, or the treasurer of state pursuant to such sections, or 4371
fails to comply with any law relating to the enforcement of such 4372
sections, the local government fund money allocated to the 4373
county may be withheld until such time as the public official 4374
has complied with such sections or such law or the rules issued 4375
pursuant thereto. 4376

(1) "City, located wholly or partially in the county, with 4378
the greatest population" means the city, located wholly or 4379
partially in the county, with the greatest population residing 4380
in the county; however, if the county budget commission on or 4381
before January 1, 1998, adopted an alternative method of 4382
apportionment that was approved by the legislative authority of 4383
the city, located partially in the county, with the greatest 4384
population but not the greatest population residing in the 4385

county, "city, located wholly or partially in the county, with 4386
the greatest population" means the city, located wholly or 4387
partially in the county, with the greatest population whether 4388
residing in the county or not, if this alternative meaning is 4389
adopted by action of the board of county commissioners and a 4390
majority of the boards of township trustees and legislative 4391
authorities of municipal corporations located wholly or 4392
partially in the county. 4393
(2) "Participating political subdivision" means a 4394

following: 4396
(a) It is located wholly or partially in the county. 4397
(b) It is not the city, located wholly or partially in the 4398
county, with the greatest population. 4399
(c) Undivided local government fund moneys are apportioned 4400
to it under the county's alternative method or formula of 4401
apportionment in the current calendar year. 4402
(B) In lieu of the method of apportionment of the 4403
undivided local government fund of the county provided by 4404
section 5747.51 of the Revised Code, the county budget 4405
commission may provide for the apportionment of the fund under 4406
an alternative method or on a formula basis as authorized by 4407
this section. The commissioner shall reduce the amount of funds 4408
from the undivided local government fund to a subdivision 4409
required to receive reduced funds under section 5747.502 of the 4410
Revised Code. 4411
Except as otherwise provided in division (C) of this 4412
section, the The alternative method of apportionment shall have 4413
first been approved by all of the following governmental units: 4414

trustees and legislative authorities of municipal corporations, 4418
located wholly or partially in the county, excluding the 4419
legislative authority of the city, located wholly or partially 4420
in the county, with the greatest population. In granting or 4421
denying approval for an alternative method of apportionment, the 4422
board of county commissioners, boards of township trustees, and 4423
legislative authorities of municipal corporations shall act by 4424
motion. A motion to approve shall be passed upon a majority vote 4425
of the members of a board of county commissioners, board of 4426
township trustees, or legislative authority of a municipal 4427
corporation, shall take effect immediately, and need not be 4428
published. 4429
Any alternative method of apportionment adopted and 4430
approved under this division shall be reviewed by the county 4431
budget commission at a public hearing held at least once in the 4432
year following the effective date of this amendment 2024 and in 4433
every fifth year thereafter. The county budget commission shall 4434
provide reasonable advance notice of the hearing to all 4435
political subdivisions eligible to participate in the fund and 4436
shall take public testimony from any such political subdivision 4437
that wishes to testify. 4438
Any alternative method of apportionment adopted and 4439
approved under this division may be revised, amended, or 4440
repealed in the same manner as it may be adopted and approved. 4441
If an alternative method of apportionment adopted and approved 4442
under this division is repealed, the undivided local government 4443
fund of the county shall be apportioned among the subdivisions 4444
eligible to participate in the fund, commencing in the ensuing 4445

5747.52 of the Revised Code, unless the repeal occurs by 4447
operation of division (C) of this section or a new method for 4448
apportionment of the fund is provided in the action of repeal. 4449
(C) This division applies only in counties in which the 4450
city, located wholly or partially in the county, with the 4451
greatest population has a population of twenty thousand or less 4452
and a population that is less than fifteen per cent of the total 4453
population of the county. In such a county, the legislative 4454
authorities or boards of township trustees of two or more 4455
participating political subdivisions, which together have a 4456
population residing in the county that is a majority of the 4457
total population of the county, each may adopt a resolution to 4458
exclude the approval otherwise required of the legislative 4459
authority of the city, located wholly or partially in the 4460
county, with the greatest population. All of the resolutions to 4461
exclude that approval shall be adopted not later than the first 4462
Monday of August of the year preceding the calendar year in 4463
which distributions are to be made under an alternative method 4464
of apportionment. 4465
A motion granting or denying approval of an alternative 4466
method of apportionment under this division shall be adopted by 4467
a majority vote of the members of the board of county 4468
commissioners and by a majority vote of a majority of the boards 4469
of township trustees and legislative authorities of the 4470
municipal corporations located wholly or partially in the 4471
county, other than the city, located wholly or partially in the 4472
county, with the greatest population, shall take effect 4473
immediately, and need not be published. The alternative method 4474
of apportionment under this division shall be adopted and 4475
approved annually, not later than the first Monday of August of 4476

alternative method of apportionment under this division repeals 4479
any existing alternative method of apportionment, effective with 4480
distributions to be made from the fund in the ensuing calendar 4481
year. An alternative method of apportionment under this division 4482
shall not be revised or amended after the first Monday of August 4483
of the year preceding the calendar year in which distributions 4484
are to be made under it. 4485
(D) (B) In determining an alternative method of 4486
apportionment authorized by this section, the county budget 4487
commission may include in the method any factor considered to be 4488
appropriate and reliable, in the sole discretion of the county 4489
budget commission. 4490

Revised Code, stating the maximum amount that the county may 4492
receive from the undivided local government fund and the minimum 4493
amount the townships in counties having a population of less 4494
than one hundred thousand may receive from the fund, are 4495
applicable to any alternative method of apportionment authorized 4496
under this section. 4497
(F)(D) On the basis of any alternative method of 4498
apportionment adopted and approved as authorized by this 4499
section, as certified by the auditor to the county treasurer, 4500
the county treasurer shall make distribution of the money in the 4501
undivided local government fund to each subdivision eligible to 4502
participate in the fund, and the auditor, when the amount of 4503
those shares is in the custody of the treasurer in the amounts 4504
so computed to be due the respective subdivisions, shall at the 4505
same time certify to the tax commissioner the percentage share 4506

of the county as a subdivision. All money received into the 4507
treasury of a subdivision from the undivided local government 4508
fund in a county treasury shall be paid into the general fund 4509
and used for the current operating expenses of the subdivision. 4510
If a municipal corporation maintains a municipal university, the 4511
university, when the board of trustees so requests the 4512
legislative authority of the municipal corporation, shall 4513
participate in the money apportioned to the municipal 4514
corporation from the total local government fund, however 4515
created and constituted, in the amount requested by the board of 4516
trustees, provided that amount does not exceed nine per cent of 4517
the total amount paid to the municipal corporation. 4518
(G)(E) The actions of the county budget commission taken 4519
pursuant to this section are final and may not be appealed to 4520
the board of tax appeals, except on the issues of abuse of 4521
discretion and failure to comply with the formula. 4522
