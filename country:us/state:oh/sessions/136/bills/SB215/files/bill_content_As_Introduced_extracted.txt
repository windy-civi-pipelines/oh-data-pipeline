(c) The tax commissioner shall adjust the reduction 130
amounts described in divisions (A)(2) and (A)(3) of this section 131
by completing the following calculations in September of each 132

each adjustment to each county auditor not later than the first 146
day of December each year. The certified reduction amount 147
applies to the following tax year. The commissioner shall not 148

surviving spouse of a public service officer killed in the line 154
of duty shall be reduced for each year for which an application 155
for the reduction has been approved. The reduction shall equal 156
the product obtained by multiplying fifty one hundred four 157
thousand six hundred dollars of the true value of the property 158
in money, as adjusted under division (A)(1)(d)(A)(2)(c) of this 159
section, by the amounts described in divisions (A)(1)(c)(ii) to 160
(iv)and (iii) of this section and further multiplied by the 161
assessment percentage established by the tax commissioner under 162
division (B) of section 5715.01 of the Revised Code, not to 163
exceed thirty-five per cent. The reduction is in lieu of any 164
reduction under section 323.158 of the Revised Code or division 165
(A)(1) or (2) of this section. The reduction applies to only one 166
homestead owned and occupied by such a surviving spouse. A 167
homestead qualifies for a reduction in taxes under division (A) 168
(3) of this section for the tax year in which the public service 169
officer dies through the tax year in which the surviving spouse 170
dies or remarries. 171
(B) To provide a partial exemption, real property taxes on 172
any homestead, and manufactured home taxes on any manufactured 173
or mobile home on which a manufactured home tax is assessed 174
pursuant to division (D)(2) of section 4503.06 of the Revised 175
Code, shall be reduced for each year for which an application 176
for the reduction has been approved. The amount of the reduction 177
shall equal two and one-half per cent of the amount of taxes to 178
be levied by qualifying levies on the homestead or the 179
manufactured or mobile home after applying section 319.301 of 180
the Revised Code. For the purposes of this division, "qualifying 181
levy" has the same meaning as in section 319.302 of the Revised 182
Code. 183
(C) The reductions granted by this section do not apply to 184

special assessments or respread of assessments levied against 185
the homestead, and if there is a transfer of ownership 186
subsequent to the filing of an application for a reduction in 187
taxes, such reductions are not forfeited for such year by virtue 188
of such transfer. 189
(D) The reductions in taxable value referred to in this 190
section shall be applied solely as a factor for the purpose of 191
computing the reduction of taxes under this section and shall 192
not affect the total value of property in any subdivision or 193
taxing district as listed and assessed for taxation on the tax 194
lists and duplicates, or any direct or indirect limitations on 195
indebtedness of a subdivision or taxing district. If after 196
application of sections 5705.31 and 5705.32 of the Revised Code, 197
including the allocation of all levies within the ten-mill 198
limitation to debt charges to the extent therein provided, there 199
would be insufficient funds for payment of debt charges not 200
provided for by levies in excess of the ten-mill limitation, the 201
reduction of taxes provided for in sections 323.151 to 323.159 202
of the Revised Code shall be proportionately adjusted to the 203
extent necessary to provide such funds from levies within the 204
ten-mill limitation. 205
(E) No reduction shall be made on the taxes due on the 206
homestead of any person convicted of violating division (D) or 207
(E) of section 323.153 of the Revised Code for a period of three 208
years following the conviction. 209
Sec. 4503.065. (A)(1) Division (A) of this section applies 210
to any of the following persons: 211

deceased person who was permanently and totally disabled or 215
sixty-five years of age or older and who applied and qualified 216

year of death, provided the surviving spouse is at least fifty- 218
nine but not sixty-five or more years of age on the date the 219
deceased spouse dies. 220
(2) The manufactured home tax on a manufactured or mobile 221
home that is paid pursuant to division (C) of section 4503.06 of 222
the Revised Code and that is owned and occupied as a home by an 223
individual whose domicile is in this state and to whom this 224
section applies, shall be reduced for any tax year for which an 225
application for such reduction has been approved, provided the 226
individual did not acquire ownership from a person, other than 227
the individual's spouse, related by consanguinity or affinity 228
for the purpose of qualifying for the reduction. An owner 229
includes a settlor of a revocable or irrevocable inter vivos 230
trust holding the title to a manufactured or mobile home 231
occupied by the settlor as of right under the trust. 232
