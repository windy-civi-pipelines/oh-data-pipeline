the owner of the salon may request a hearing pursuant to section 184
119.07 of the Revised Code. If the individual or owner fails to 185
request a hearing or enter into a consent agreement thirty days 186
after the date the board, in accordance with section 119.07 of 187
the Revised Code and division (J) of this section, notifies the 188
individual or owner of the board's intent to act against the 189

(H) The board, after a hearing in accordance with Chapter 194
119. of the Revised Code or pursuant to a consent agreement, may 195
suspend a license, permit, or registration if the licensee, 196
permit holder, or registrant fails to correct an unsafe 197
condition that exists in violation of the board's rules or fails 198
to cooperate in an inspection. If a violation of this chapter or 199
rules adopted under it has resulted in a condition reasonably 200
believed by an inspector to create an immediate danger to the 201
health and safety of any individual using the facility, the 202
inspector may suspend the license or permit of the facility or 203
the individual responsible for the violation without a prior 204
hearing until the condition is corrected or until a hearing in 205
accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code is held or a 206
consent agreement is entered into and the board either upholds 207
the suspension or reinstates the license, permit, or 208
registration. 209
(I) The board shall not take disciplinary action against 210
an individual licensed to operate a salon or school of 211
cosmetology for a violation of this chapter that was committed 212
by an individual licensed to practice a branch of cosmetology, 213
while practicing within the salon or school, when the 214
individual's actions were beyond the control of the salon owner 215
or school. 216
(J) In addition to the methods of notification required 217
under section 119.07 of the Revised Code, the board may send the 218
notices required under divisions (C)(2), (E)(2), and (G) of this 219
section by any delivery method that is traceable and requires 220
that the delivery person obtain a signature to verify that the 221
notice has been delivered. The board also may send the notices 222
by electronic mail, provided that the electronic mail delivery 223
system certifies that a notice has been received. 224
