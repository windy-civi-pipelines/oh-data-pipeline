Honoring the Rotary Club of Newcomerstown on its One
Hundredth Anniversary.
WHEREAS, The members of the House of Representatives of the 136th 1
General Assembly of Ohio are pleased to extend special recognition to 2
the Rotary Club of Newcomerstown on the commemoration of its 3
Centennial, September 29, 2025; and 4
WHEREAS, One hundred years is a distinctive milestone on which the 5
Rotary Club of Newcomerstown can enthusiastically celebrate its 6
mission to enrich its members and the community with philanthropic, 7
civic, and social activities. Founded in 1925, this iconic club has 8
overcome challenges and persevered by remaining a relevant resource 9
for the community, and it has paid homage to its long and 10
distinguished history through its thoughtful outreach to Newcomerstown 11
and the surrounding area; and 12
WHEREAS, One of many reasons that the State of Ohio continues to 13
prosper is because of such organizations as the Rotary Club of 14
Newcomerstown. Among its earliest endeavors, the group held benefits 15
and raised funds for charitable causes, and it went on to contribute 16
to the growth of the area by purchasing land to be used as a community 17
park, supporting the annual Cy Young Bike Tour, the Temperance Tavern 18
Museum expansion, the local Little League program, and sponsoring 19
countless scholarships for area youth; and 20
WHEREAS, The members of the Rotary Club of Newcomerstown can 21
always be relied upon to favor a worthy cause, and these exceptional 22
people have made a lasting impact on the community through their 23
admirable resolve and vision. We look with optimism to a society that 24
will thrive as a result of the initiatives of all those who have 25
comprised the organization, both past and present; therefore be it 26
