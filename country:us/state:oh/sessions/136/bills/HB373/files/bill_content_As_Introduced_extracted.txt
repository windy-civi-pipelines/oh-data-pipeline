under Traffic Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the 311
court shall order that the restitution be made to the victim in 312
open court or to the adult probation department that serves the 313
jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of the victim. 314

victim's attorney, if applicable, the prosecutor or the 317
prosecutor's designee, and the offender may provide information 318
relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution. The 319
amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the 320
amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct 321
and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the 322
court imposes restitution for the cost of accounting or auditing 323
done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court may 324
order restitution for any amount of the victim's costs of 325
accounting or auditing provided that the amount of restitution 326
is reasonable and does not exceed the value of property or 327
services stolen or damaged as a result of the offense. If the 328
court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the court 329
shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the 330
offender, victim, victim's representative, victim's attorney, if 331
applicable, or victim's estate disputes the amount of 332
restitution. The court shall determine the amount of full 333
restitution by a preponderance of the evidence. 334
All restitution payments shall be credited against any 335
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the 336
victim or the victim's estate against the offender. No person 337
may introduce evidence of an award of restitution under this 338

Section 14:
section in a civil action for purposes of imposing liability 339

The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of 341
not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution 342
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and 343
processing restitution payments. 344
The victim, victim's attorney, if applicable, or the 345
attorney for the victim's estate may request that the prosecutor 346
in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, 347
for modification of the payment terms of any restitution 348
ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the 349
payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce 350
the amount of restitution ordered, except as provided in 351
division (A) of section 2929.281 of the Revised Code. 352

financial sanction may do the following: 517
(1) Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies 518
or private vendors for the collection of amounts due under the 519

amounts due from an offender pursuant to any financial sanction 521
imposed pursuant to this section, a court shall comply with 522

Section 26:
sections 307.86 to 307.92 of the Revised Code. 523
(2) Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction 524
in installments, by financial transaction device if the court is 525
a county court or a municipal court operated by a county, by 526
credit or debit card or by another electronic transfer if the 527
court is a municipal court not operated by a county, or by any 528
other reasonable method, in any time, and on any terms that 529
court considers just. If the court is a county court or a 530
municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of payments 531
by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the 532
policy adopted by the board of county commissioners of the 533
county pursuant to section 301.28 of the Revised Code. If the 534
court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the clerk 535
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic 536
transfer out of public money or may charge the fee to the 537
offender. 538
(3) To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable 539
fee to an offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump 540
sum payment of any financial sanction. 541
(H) No financial sanction imposed under this section shall 542
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the 543
offender. 544
H. B. No. 373 Page 20

incarceration costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty 546
of the person authorized to make disbursements from assets of 547
the business or corporation to pay the restitution, fines, fees, 548
or incarceration costs from those assets. 549
Sec. 5122.311. (A) Notwithstanding any provision of the 550
Revised Code to the contrary, if, on or after April 8, 2004, an 551
individual is found by a court to be a person with a mental 552
illness subject to court order or becomes an involuntary patient 553
other than one who is a patient only for purposes of 554
observation, the probate judge who made the adjudication or the 555
chief clinical officer of the hospital, community mental health 556
services provider, or facility in which the person is an 557
involuntary patient shall notify the office of the attorney 558
general, on the form described in division (C) of this section, 559
of the identity of the individual. The notification shall be 560
transmitted by the judge or the chief clinical officer not later 561
than seven days after the adjudication or commitment. 562
(B) The office of the attorney general shall compile and 563
maintain the notices it receives under division (A) of this 564

Section 27:
section and the notices shall be used for the purpose of 565
conducting incompetency records checks requested by sheriffs, 566
federally licensed firearms dealers, or law enforcement agencies 567
pursuant to section 311.41 or 2923.26 of the Revised Code. 568
Records checks requested by a federally licensed firearms dealer 569
or law enforcement agency pursuant to section 2923.26 of the 570
Revised Code shall be conducted, and results of the checks shall 571
be provided, immediately upon receipt of the request. The 572
notices referred to in this division and the information they 573
contain are confidential, except as provided in this division, 574
and are not public records. 575
H. B. No. 373 Page 21

(C) The attorney general, by rule adopted under Chapter 576

Section 28:
119. of the Revised Code, shall prescribe and make available to 577
all probate judges and all chief clinical officers a form to be 578
used by them for the purpose of making the notifications 579
required by division (A) of this section. 580

Section 29:
Section 2. That existing sections 2929.28 and 5122.311 of 581
the Revised Code are hereby repealed. 582

Section 30:
Section 3. This act shall be known as the Universal 583
Background Checks Act. 584

Section 31:
Section 4. Section 2929.28 of the Revised Code is 585
presented in this act as a composite of the section as amended 586
by both H.B. 33 and S.B. 16 of the 135th General Assembly. The 587
General Assembly, applying the principle stated in division (B) 588
of section 1.52 of the Revised Code that amendments are to be 589
harmonized if reasonably capable of simultaneous operation, 590
finds that the composite is the resulting version of the section 591
in effect prior to the effective date of the section as 592
presented in this act. 593

imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, 293
including a minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any 294
financial sanction or combination of financial sanctions 295

restitution pursuant to this section and section 2929.281 of the 299

this section, imposes one or more financial sanctions, the 301
financial sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section 302
include, but are not limited to, the following: 303
(1) Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by 304
the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic 305
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the 306
offender's crime or the victim's estate, in an amount based on 307
the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose restitution 308

H. B. No. 373 Page 12
As Introduced
as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be 309
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court 310
under Traffic Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the 311
court shall order that the restitution be made to the victim in 312
open court or to the adult probation department that serves the 313
jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of the victim. 314
The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be 315
paid by the offender. The victim, victim's representative, 316
victim's attorney, if applicable, the prosecutor or the 317
prosecutor's designee, and the offender may provide information 318
relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution. The 319
amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the 320
amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct 321
and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the 322
court imposes restitution for the cost of accounting or auditing 323
done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court may 324
order restitution for any amount of the victim's costs of 325
accounting or auditing provided that the amount of restitution 326
is reasonable and does not exceed the value of property or 327
services stolen or damaged as a result of the offense. If the 328
court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the court 329
shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the 330
offender, victim, victim's representative, victim's attorney, if 331
applicable, or victim's estate disputes the amount of 332
restitution. The court shall determine the amount of full 333
restitution by a preponderance of the evidence. 334
All restitution payments shall be credited against any 335
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the 336
victim or the victim's estate against the offender. No person 337
may introduce evidence of an award of restitution under this 338
section in a civil action for purposes of imposing liability 339

H. B. No. 373 Page 13

against an insurer under section 3937.18 of the Revised Code. 340
The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of 341
not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution 342
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and 343
processing restitution payments. 344
The victim, victim's attorney, if applicable, or the 345
attorney for the victim's estate may request that the prosecutor 346
in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, 347
for modification of the payment terms of any restitution 348
ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the 349
payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce 350
the amount of restitution ordered, except as provided in 351
division (A) of section 2929.281 of the Revised Code. 352
(2) A fine of the type described in divisions (A)(2)(a) 353

(b) A state fine or cost as defined in section 2949.111 of 367

costs of sanctions incurred by the government, including, but 370
not limited to, the following: 371

offender while confined; 380
(iii) All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an 381
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition 382
interlock device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a 383
court orders an offender to use under section 4510.13 of the 384
Revised Code. 385
(b) The amount of reimbursement ordered under division (A) 386
(3)(a) of this section shall not exceed the total amount of 387
reimbursement the offender is able to pay and shall not exceed 388
the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may collect any 389
amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under 390
that division. If the court does not order reimbursement under 391
that division, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a 392
repayment policy adopted under section 2929.37 of the Revised 393
Code. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees 394
specified in section 2929.38 of the Revised Code in accordance 395

Revised Code, the court shall impose upon the offender a 398
mandatory fine in the amount specified in division (J)(2)(a), 399
(b), or (c) of that section. 400
(B) If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the 401
court may hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is 402
able to pay the financial sanction imposed pursuant to this 403
section or court costs or is likely in the future to be able to 404
pay the sanction or costs. 405
If the court determines that the offender is indigent and 406
unable to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court 407
shall consider imposing and may impose a term of community 408
service under division (A) of section 2929.27 of the Revised 409
Code in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If 410
the court does not determine that the offender is indigent, the 411
court may impose a term of community service under division (A) 412
of section 2929.27 of the Revised Code in lieu of or in addition 413
to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in 414
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community 415
service for a minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (D) of 416
section 2929.27 of the Revised Code in lieu of or in addition to 417
imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition 418
to imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial 419
sanction or court costs, the court may order community service 420
in lieu of the financial sanction or court costs. 421
(C)(1) The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon 422
the offender pursuant to division (A)(3) of this section to pay 423

pursuant to a sanction imposed under section 2929.26 of the 427

county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the 430
costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed 431
under this section or section 2929.26 or 2929.27 of the Revised 432

a judgment in favor of the state or the political subdivision 475
that operates the court that imposed the financial sanction, and 476
the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment 477
debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant 478

judgment in favor of the entity administering the community 480
control sanction, and the offender subject to the financial 481

section is an order in favor of the victim of the offender's 489
criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of 490
judgment as described in division (E)(1) of this section, 491
through execution as described in division (E)(2) of this 492
section, or through an order as described in division (E)(3) of 493
this section, and the offender shall be considered for purposes 494
of the collection as the judgment debtor. 495

order under this division, the victim, private provider, state, 497
or political subdivision may do any of the following: 498
(1) Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the 499
judgment was entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment 500
that shall be in the same manner and form as a certificate of 501
judgment issued in a civil action; 502
(2) Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any 503

in divisions (D)(1) and (2) of section 2929.18 of the Revised 505
Code. 506
(3) Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the 507
judgment debtor under section 1321.33 of the Revised Code. 508
(F) The civil remedies authorized under division (E) of 509
this section for the collection of the financial sanction 510
supplement, but do not preclude, enforcement of the criminal 511
sentence. 512
(G) Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an 513
offender under this section may designate the clerk of the court 514

H. B. No. 373 Page 19
As Introduced
or another person to collect the financial sanction. The clerk, 515
or another person authorized by law or the court to collect the 516
financial sanction may do the following: 517
(1) Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies 518
or private vendors for the collection of amounts due under the 519
sanction. Before entering into a contract for the collection of 520
amounts due from an offender pursuant to any financial sanction 521
imposed pursuant to this section, a court shall comply with 522
sections 307.86 to 307.92 of the Revised Code. 523
(2) Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction 524
in installments, by financial transaction device if the court is 525
a county court or a municipal court operated by a county, by 526
credit or debit card or by another electronic transfer if the 527
court is a municipal court not operated by a county, or by any 528
other reasonable method, in any time, and on any terms that 529
court considers just. If the court is a county court or a 530
municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of payments 531
by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the 532
policy adopted by the board of county commissioners of the 533
county pursuant to section 301.28 of the Revised Code. If the 534
court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the clerk 535
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic 536
transfer out of public money or may charge the fee to the 537
offender. 538
(3) To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable 539
fee to an offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump 540
sum payment of any financial sanction. 541
(H) No financial sanction imposed under this section shall 542
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the 543
offender. 544

(I) If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or 545
incarceration costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty 546

Revised Code to the contrary, if, on or after April 8, 2004, an 551
individual is found by a court to be a person with a mental 552
illness subject to court order or becomes an involuntary patient 553
other than one who is a patient only for purposes of 554
observation, the probate judge who made the adjudication or the 555
chief clinical officer of the hospital, community mental health 556
services provider, or facility in which the person is an 557
involuntary patient shall notify the office of the attorney 558
general, on the form described in division (C) of this section, 559
of the identity of the individual. The notification shall be 560
transmitted by the judge or the chief clinical officer not later 561
than seven days after the adjudication or commitment. 562
(B) The office of the attorney general shall compile and 563
maintain the notices it receives under division (A) of this 564
section and the notices shall be used for the purpose of 565
conducting incompetency records checks requested by sheriffs, 566
federally licensed firearms dealers, or law enforcement agencies 567

or law enforcement agency pursuant to section 2923.26 of the 570
Revised Code shall be conducted, and results of the checks shall 571
be provided, immediately upon receipt of the request. The 572
