district plan, including to support the issuance of revenue 372
bonds under section 1787.08 of the Revised Code. 373

A percentage of the benefit assessments, not to exceed two per 376
cent, may be retained by the county, township, or municipal 377
corporation to offset the cost of collection as described in the 378
district plan. 379
All other revenue from the benefit assessment shall be 380
used solely for the purposes specified in the district plan. 381

the authorizing legislative authority as a debt under law. 385
Any delinquent payments for benefit assessments, interest, 386
or penalties recovered under this section shall be expended in 387
the same manner as provided in the district plan for proceeds of 388
