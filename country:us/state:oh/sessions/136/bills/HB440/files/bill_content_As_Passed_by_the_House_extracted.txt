at a deposition, or in written interrogatories, except that 298
failure to cooperate with an investigation does not constitute 299
grounds for discipline if a court of competent jurisdiction has 300
issued an order that either quashes a subpoena or permits the 301
individual to withhold testimony or evidence at issue. 302
(C) Disciplinary actions taken by the board under 303
divisions (A) and (B) of this section shall be taken pursuant to 304

H. B. No. 440 Page 12
As Passed by the House
an adjudication conducted under Chapter 119. of the Revised 305
Code, except that in lieu of a hearing, the board may enter into 306
a consent agreement with an individual to resolve an allegation 307
of a violation of this chapter or any rule adopted under it. A 308
consent agreement, when ratified by a vote of a quorum, shall 309
constitute the findings and order of the board with respect to 310
the matter addressed in the agreement. If the board refuses to 311
ratify a consent agreement, the admissions and findings 312
contained in the agreement shall be of no effect. 313
(D) The hearings of the board shall be conducted in 314
accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code, the board may 315
appoint a hearing examiner, as provided in section 119.09 of the 316
Revised Code, to conduct any hearing the board is authorized to 317
hold under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code. 318
In any instance in which the board is required under 319
Chapter 119. of the Revised Code to give notice of an 320
opportunity for a hearing and the applicant, licensee, or 321
certificate holder does not make a timely request for a hearing 322
in accordance with section 119.07 of the Revised Code, the board 323
is not required to hold a hearing, but may adopt, by a vote of a 324
quorum, a final order that contains the board's findings. In the 325
final order, the board may order any of the sanctions listed in 326
division (A) or (B) of this section. 327
(E) If a criminal action is brought against a registered 328
nurse, licensed practical nurse, or dialysis technician for an 329
act or crime described in divisions (B)(3) to (7) of this 330
section and the action is dismissed by the trial court other 331
than on the merits, the board shall conduct an adjudication to 332
determine whether the registered nurse, licensed practical 333
nurse, or dialysis technician committed the act on which the 334

H. B. No. 440 Page 13
As Passed by the House
action was based. If the board determines on the basis of the 335
adjudication that the registered nurse, licensed practical 336
nurse, or dialysis technician committed the act, or if the 337
registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, or dialysis 338
technician fails to participate in the adjudication, the board 339
may take action as though the registered nurse, licensed 340
practical nurse, or dialysis technician had been convicted of 341
the act. 342
If the board takes action on the basis of a conviction, 343
plea, or a judicial finding as described in divisions (B)(3) to 344
(7) of this section that is overturned on appeal, the registered 345
nurse, licensed practical nurse, or dialysis technician may, on 346
exhaustion of the appeal process, petition the board for 347
reconsideration of its action. On receipt of the petition and 348
supporting court documents, the board shall temporarily rescind 349
its action. If the board determines that the decision on appeal 350
was a decision on the merits, it shall permanently rescind its 351
action. If the board determines that the decision on appeal was 352
not a decision on the merits, it shall conduct an adjudication 353
to determine whether the registered nurse, licensed practical 354
nurse, or dialysis technician committed the act on which the 355
original conviction, plea, or judicial finding was based. If the 356
board determines on the basis of the adjudication that the 357
registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, or dialysis 358
technician committed such act, or if the registered nurse, 359
licensed practical nurse, or dialysis technician does not 360
request an adjudication, the board shall reinstate its action; 361
otherwise, the board shall permanently rescind its action. 362
Notwithstanding the provision of division (D)(2) of 363
section 2953.32 or division (F)(1) of section 2953.39 of the 364
Revised Code specifying that if records pertaining to a criminal 365

H. B. No. 440 Page 14
As Passed by the House
case are sealed or expunged under that section the proceedings 366
in the case shall be deemed not to have occurred, sealing or 367
expungement of the following records on which the board has 368
based an action under this section shall have no effect on the 369
board's action or any sanction imposed by the board under this 370
section: records of any conviction, guilty plea, judicial 371
finding of guilt resulting from a plea of no contest, or a 372
judicial finding of eligibility for a pretrial diversion program 373
or intervention in lieu of conviction. 374
The board shall not be required to seal, destroy, redact, 375
or otherwise modify its records to reflect the court's sealing 376
or expungement of conviction records. 377
(F) The board may investigate an individual's criminal 378
background in performing its duties under this section. As part 379
of such investigation, the board may order the individual to 380
submit, at the individual's expense, a request to the bureau of 381
criminal identification and investigation for a criminal records 382
check and check of federal bureau of investigation records in 383
accordance with the procedure described in pursuant to section 384
4723.091 of the Revised Code. 385
(G) During the course of an investigation conducted under 386
this section, the board may compel any registered nurse, 387
licensed practical nurse, or dialysis technician or applicant 388
under this chapter to submit to a mental or physical 389
examination, or both, as required by the board and at the 390
expense of the individual, if the board finds reason to believe 391
that the individual under investigation may have a physical or 392
mental impairment that may affect the individual's ability to 393
provide safe nursing or dialysis care. 394
The board shall not compel an individual who has been 395

H. B. No. 440 Page 15
As Passed by the House
referred to the safe haven program as described in sections 396
4723.35 and 4723.351 of the Revised Code to submit to a mental 397
or physical examination. 398
Failure of any individual to submit to a mental or 399
physical examination when directed constitutes an admission of 400
the allegations, unless the failure is due to circumstances 401
beyond the individual's control, and a default and final order 402
may be entered without the taking of testimony or presentation 403
of evidence. 404
If the board finds that an individual is impaired, the 405
board shall require the individual to submit to care, 406
counseling, or treatment approved or designated by the board, as 407
a condition for initial, continued, reinstated, or renewed 408
authority to practice. The individual shall be afforded an 409
opportunity to demonstrate to the board that the individual can 410
begin or resume the individual's occupation in compliance with 411
acceptable and prevailing standards of care under the provisions 412
of the individual's authority to practice. 413
For purposes of this division, any registered nurse, 414
licensed practical nurse, or dialysis technician or applicant 415
under this chapter shall be deemed to have given consent to 416
submit to a mental or physical examination when directed to do 417
so in writing by the board, and to have waived all objections to 418
the admissibility of testimony or examination reports that 419
constitute a privileged communication. 420
(H) The board shall investigate evidence that appears to 421
show that any person has violated any provision of this chapter 422
or any rule of the board. Any person may report to the board any 423
information the person may have that appears to show a violation 424
of any provision of this chapter or rule of the board. In the 425

H. B. No. 440 Page 16
As Passed by the House
absence of bad faith, any person who reports such information or 426
who testifies before the board in any adjudication conducted 427
under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code shall not be liable for 428
civil damages as a result of the report or testimony. 429
(I) All of the following apply under this chapter with 430
respect to the confidentiality of information: 431
(1) Information received by the board pursuant to a 432
complaint or an investigation is confidential and not subject to 433
discovery in any civil action, except that the board may 434
disclose information to law enforcement officers and government 435
entities for purposes of an investigation of either a licensed 436
health care professional, including a registered nurse, licensed 437
practical nurse, or dialysis technician, or a person who may 438
have engaged in the unauthorized practice of nursing or dialysis 439
care. No law enforcement officer or government entity with 440
knowledge of any information disclosed by the board pursuant to 441
this division shall divulge the information to any other person 442
or government entity except for the purpose of a government 443
investigation, a prosecution, or an adjudication by a court or 444
government entity. 445
(2) If an investigation requires a review of patient 446
records, the investigation and proceeding shall be conducted in 447
such a manner as to protect patient confidentiality. 448
(3) All adjudications and investigations of the board 449
shall be considered civil actions for the purposes of section 450
2305.252 of the Revised Code. 451
(4) Any board activity that involves continued monitoring 452
of an individual as part of or following any disciplinary action 453
taken under this section shall be conducted in a manner that 454

H. B. No. 440 Page 17
As Passed by the House
maintains the individual's confidentiality. Information received 455
or maintained by the board with respect to the board's 456
monitoring activities is not subject to discovery in any civil 457
action and is confidential, except that the board may disclose 458
information to law enforcement officers and government entities 459
for purposes of an investigation of a licensee or certificate 460
holder. 461
(J) Any action taken by the board under this section 462
resulting in a suspension from practice shall be accompanied by 463
a written statement of the conditions under which the person may 464
be reinstated to practice. 465
(K) When the board refuses to grant a license or 466
certificate to an applicant, revokes a license or certificate, 467
or refuses to reinstate a license or certificate, the board may 468
specify that its action is permanent. An individual subject to 469
permanent action taken by the board is forever ineligible to 470
hold a license or certificate of the type that was refused or 471
revoked and the board shall not accept from the individual an 472
application for reinstatement of the license or certificate or 473
for a new license or certificate. 474
(L) No unilateral surrender of a nursing license or 475
dialysis technician certificate issued under this chapter shall 476
be effective unless accepted by majority vote of the board. No 477
application for a nursing license or dialysis technician 478
certificate issued under this chapter may be withdrawn without a 479
majority vote of the board. The board's jurisdiction to take 480
disciplinary action under this section is not removed or limited 481
when an individual has a license or certificate classified as 482
inactive or fails to renew a license or certificate. 483
(M) Sanctions shall not be imposed under division (B)(24) 484

H. B. No. 440 Page 18
As Passed by the House
of this section against any licensee who waives deductibles and 485
copayments as follows: 486
(1) In compliance with the health benefit plan that 487
expressly allows such a practice. Waiver of the deductibles or 488
copayments shall be made only with the full knowledge and 489
consent of the plan purchaser, payer, and third-party 490
administrator. Documentation of the consent shall be made 491
available to the board upon request. 492
(2) For professional services rendered to any other person 493
licensed pursuant to this chapter to the extent allowed by this 494
chapter and the rules of the board. 495
Section 2. That existing sections 4723.091, 4723.092, and 496
4723.28 of the Revised Code are hereby repealed. 497
Section 3. This act is hereby declared to be an emergency 498
measure necessary for the immediate preservation of the public 499
peace, health, and safety. The reason for such necessity is that 500
enactment into law at the earliest possible time will preserve 501
the confidentiality of Board of Nursing-related criminal records 502
check information and will restrict access to such information 503
only to individuals subject to such checks and to the Board for 504
the purpose of fulfilling specific statutory duties. Therefore, 505
this act shall go into immediate effect. 506
