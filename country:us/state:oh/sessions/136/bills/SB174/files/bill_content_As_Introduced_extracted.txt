parents' residences is to serve as the child's home. The child 4021
support obligations of the parents under a shared parenting 4022

(B)(1) When making the allocation of the parental rights 4026
and responsibilities for the care of the children under this 4027

Section 165:
section in an original proceeding or in any proceeding for 4028
modification of a prior order of the court making the 4029
allocation, the court shall take into account that which would 4030
be in the best interest of the children. In determining the 4031
child's best interest for purposes of making its allocation of 4032
the parental rights and responsibilities for the care of the 4033
child and for purposes of resolving any issues related to the 4034
making of that allocation, the court, in its discretion, may 4035
and, upon the request of either party, shall interview in 4036
chambers any or all of the involved children regarding their 4037
wishes and concerns with respect to the allocation. 4038
(2) If the court interviews any child pursuant to division 4039
(B)(1) of this section, all of the following apply: 4040
S. B. No. 174 Page 137
As Introduced
(a) The court, in its discretion, may and, upon the motion 4041
of either parent, shall appoint a guardian ad litem for the 4042
child. 4043
(b) The court first shall determine the reasoning ability 4044
of the child. If the court determines that the child does not 4045
have sufficient reasoning ability to express the child's wishes 4046
and concern with respect to the allocation of parental rights 4047
and responsibilities for the care of the child, it shall not 4048
determine the child's wishes and concerns with respect to the 4049
allocation. If the court determines that the child has 4050
sufficient reasoning ability to express the child's wishes or 4051
concerns with respect to the allocation, it then shall determine 4052
whether, because of special circumstances, it would not be in 4053
the best interest of the child to determine the child's wishes 4054
and concerns with respect to the allocation. If the court 4055
determines that, because of special circumstances, it would not 4056
be in the best interest of the child to determine the child's 4057
wishes and concerns with respect to the allocation, it shall not 4058
determine the child's wishes and concerns with respect to the 4059
allocation and shall enter its written findings of fact and 4060
opinion in the journal. If the court determines that it would be 4061
in the best interests of the child to determine the child's 4062
wishes and concerns with respect to the allocation, it shall 4063
proceed to make that determination. 4064
(c) The interview shall be conducted in chambers, and no 4065
person other than the child, the child's attorney, the judge, 4066
any necessary court personnel, and, in the judge's discretion, 4067
the attorney of each parent shall be permitted to be present in 4068
the chambers during the interview. 4069
(3) No person shall obtain or attempt to obtain from a 4070

child a written or recorded statement or affidavit setting forth 4071
the child's wishes and concerns regarding the allocation of 4072
parental rights and responsibilities concerning the child. No 4073
court, in determining the child's best interest for purposes of 4074
making its allocation of the parental rights and 4075
responsibilities for the care of the child or for purposes of 4076
resolving any issues related to the making of that allocation, 4077
shall accept or consider a written or recorded statement or 4078
affidavit that purports to set forth the child's wishes and 4079
concerns regarding those matters. 4080
(C) Prior to trial, the court may cause an investigation 4081
to be made as to the character, family relations, past conduct, 4082
earning ability, and financial worth of each parent and may 4083
order the parents and their minor children to submit to medical, 4084
psychological, and psychiatric examinations. The report of the 4085
investigation and examinations shall be made available to either 4086
parent or the parent's counsel of record not less than five days 4087
before trial, upon written request. The report shall be signed 4088
by the investigator, and the investigator shall be subject to 4089
cross-examination by either parent concerning the contents of 4090
the report. The court may tax as costs all or any part of the 4091
expenses for each investigation. 4092
If the court determines that either parent previously has 4093
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any criminal offense 4094
involving any act that resulted in a child being a neglected 4095
child, that either parent previously has been determined to be 4096
the perpetrator of the neglectful act that is the basis of an 4097
adjudication that a child is a neglected child, or that there is 4098
reason to believe that either parent has acted in a manner 4099
resulting in a child being a neglected child, the court shall 4100
consider that fact against naming that parent the residential 4101

court allocates parental rights and responsibilities for the 4103
care of children or determines whether to grant shared parenting 4104
in any proceeding, it shall consider whether either parent or 4105
any member of the household of either parent has been convicted 4106
of or pleaded guilty to a violation of section 2919.25 of the 4107
Revised Code or a sexually oriented offense involving a victim 4108
who at the time of the commission of the offense was a member of 4109
the family or household that is the subject of the proceeding, 4110
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any sexually oriented 4111
offense or other offense involving a victim who at the time of 4112
the commission of the offense was a member of the family or 4113
household that is the subject of the proceeding and caused 4114
physical harm to the victim in the commission of the offense, or 4115
has been determined to be the perpetrator of the abusive act 4116
that is the basis of an adjudication that a child is an abused 4117
child. If the court determines that either parent has been 4118
convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of section 2919.25 4119
of the Revised Code or a sexually oriented offense involving a 4120
victim who at the time of the commission of the offense was a 4121
member of the family or household that is the subject of the 4122
proceeding, has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any 4123
sexually oriented offense or other offense involving a victim 4124
who at the time of the commission of the offense was a member of 4125
the family or household that is the subject of the proceeding 4126
and caused physical harm to the victim in the commission of the 4127
offense, or has been determined to be the perpetrator of the 4128
abusive act that is the basis of an adjudication that a child is 4129
an abused child, it may designate that parent as the residential 4130
parent and may issue a shared parenting decree or order only if 4131
it determines that it is in the best interest of the child to 4132
name that parent the residential parent or to issue a shared 4133

(D)(1)(a) Upon the filing of a pleading or motion by 4136
either parent or both parents, in accordance with division (G) 4137
of this section, requesting shared parenting and the filing of a 4138
shared parenting plan in accordance with that division, the 4139
court shall comply with division (D)(1)(a)(i), (ii), or (iii) of 4140
this section, whichever is applicable: 4141
(i) If both parents jointly make the request in their 4142
pleadings or jointly file the motion and also jointly file the 4143
plan, the court shall review the parents' plan to determine if 4144
it is in the best interest of the children. If the court 4145
determines that the plan is in the best interest of the 4146
children, the court shall approve it. If the court determines 4147
that the plan or any part of the plan is not in the best 4148
interest of the children, the court shall require the parents to 4149
make appropriate changes to the plan to meet the court's 4150
objections to it. If changes to the plan are made to meet the 4151
court's objections, and if the new plan is in the best interest 4152
of the children, the court shall approve the plan. If changes to 4153
the plan are not made to meet the court's objections, or if the 4154
parents attempt to make changes to the plan to meet the court's 4155
objections, but the court determines that the new plan or any 4156
part of the new plan still is not in the best interest of the 4157
children, the court may reject the portion of the parents' 4158
pleadings or deny their motion requesting shared parenting of 4159
the children and proceed as if the request in the pleadings or 4160
the motion had not been made. The court shall not approve a plan 4161
under this division unless it determines that the plan is in the 4162
best interest of the children. 4163

(ii) If each parent makes a request in the parent's 4164
pleadings or files a motion and each also files a separate plan, 4165
the court shall review each plan filed to determine if either is 4166
in the best interest of the children. If the court determines 4167
that one of the filed plans is in the best interest of the 4168
children, the court may approve the plan. If the court 4169
determines that neither filed plan is in the best interest of 4170
the children, the court may order each parent to submit 4171
appropriate changes to the parent's plan or both of the filed 4172
plans to meet the court's objections, or may select one of the 4173
filed plans and order each parent to submit appropriate changes 4174
to the selected plan to meet the court's objections. If changes 4175
to the plan or plans are submitted to meet the court's 4176
objections, and if any of the filed plans with the changes is in 4177
the best interest of the children, the court may approve the 4178
plan with the changes. If changes to the plan or plans are not 4179
submitted to meet the court's objections, or if the parents 4180
submit changes to the plan or plans to meet the court's 4181
objections but the court determines that none of the filed plans 4182
with the submitted changes is in the best interest of the 4183
children, the court may reject the portion of the parents' 4184
pleadings or deny their motions requesting shared parenting of 4185
the children and proceed as if the requests in the pleadings or 4186
the motions had not been made. If the court approves a plan 4187
under this division, either as originally filed or with 4188
submitted changes, or if the court rejects the portion of the 4189
parents' pleadings or denies their motions requesting shared 4190
parenting under this division and proceeds as if the requests in 4191
the pleadings or the motions had not been made, the court shall 4192
enter in the record of the case findings of fact and conclusions 4193
of law as to the reasons for the approval or the rejection or 4194
denial. Division (D)(1)(b) of this section applies in relation 4195
S. B. No. 174 Page 142

to the approval or disapproval of a plan under this division. 4196
(iii) If each parent makes a request in the parent's 4197
pleadings or files a motion but only one parent files a plan, or 4198
if only one parent makes a request in the parent's pleadings or 4199
files a motion and also files a plan, the court in the best 4200
interest of the children may order the other parent to file a 4201
plan for shared parenting in accordance with division (G) of 4202
this section. The court shall review each plan filed to 4203
determine if any plan is in the best interest of the children. 4204
If the court determines that one of the filed plans is in the 4205
best interest of the children, the court may approve the plan. 4206
If the court determines that no filed plan is in the best 4207
interest of the children, the court may order each parent to 4208
submit appropriate changes to the parent's plan or both of the 4209
filed plans to meet the court's objections or may select one 4210
filed plan and order each parent to submit appropriate changes 4211
to the selected plan to meet the court's objections. If changes 4212
to the plan or plans are submitted to meet the court's 4213
objections, and if any of the filed plans with the changes is in 4214
the best interest of the children, the court may approve the 4215
plan with the changes. If changes to the plan or plans are not 4216
submitted to meet the court's objections, or if the parents 4217
submit changes to the plan or plans to meet the court's 4218
objections but the court determines that none of the filed plans 4219
with the submitted changes is in the best interest of the 4220
children, the court may reject the portion of the parents' 4221
pleadings or deny the parents' motion or reject the portion of 4222
the parents' pleadings or deny their motions requesting shared 4223
parenting of the children and proceed as if the request or 4224
requests or the motion or motions had not been made. If the 4225
court approves a plan under this division, either as originally 4226

filed or with submitted changes, or if the court rejects the 4227
portion of the pleadings or denies the motion or motions 4228
requesting shared parenting under this division and proceeds as 4229
if the request or requests or the motion or motions had not been 4230
made, the court shall enter in the record of the case findings 4231
of fact and conclusions of law as to the reasons for the 4232
approval or the rejection or denial. Division (D)(1)(b) of this 4233

Section 166:
section applies in relation to the approval or disapproval of a 4234
plan under this division. 4235
(b) The approval of a plan under division (D)(1)(a)(ii) or 4236
(iii) of this section is discretionary with the court. The court 4237
shall not approve more than one plan under either division and 4238
shall not approve a plan under either division unless it 4239
determines that the plan is in the best interest of the 4240
children. If the court, under either division, does not 4241
determine that any filed plan or any filed plan with submitted 4242
changes is in the best interest of the children, the court shall 4243
not approve any plan. 4244
(c) Whenever possible, the court shall require that a 4245
shared parenting plan approved under division (D)(1)(a)(i), 4246
(ii), or (iii) of this section ensure the opportunity for both 4247
parents to have frequent and continuing contact with the child, 4248
unless frequent and continuing contact with any parent would not 4249
be in the best interest of the child. 4250
(d) If a court approves a shared parenting plan under 4251
division (D)(1)(a)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, the 4252
approved plan shall be incorporated into a final shared 4253
parenting decree granting the parents the shared parenting of 4254
the children. Any final shared parenting decree shall be issued 4255
at the same time as and shall be appended to the final decree of 4256

parental rights and responsibilities for the care of the 4259
children arose. 4260
No provisional shared parenting decree shall be issued in 4261
relation to any shared parenting plan approved under division 4262
(D)(1)(a)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section. A final shared 4263
parenting decree issued under this division has immediate effect 4264
as a final decree on the date of its issuance, subject to 4265
modification or termination as authorized by this section. 4266
(2) If the court finds, with respect to any child under 4267
eighteen years of age, that it is in the best interest of the 4268
child for neither parent to be designated the residential parent 4269
and legal custodian of the child, it may commit the child to a 4270
relative of the child or certify a copy of its findings, 4271
together with as much of the record and the further information, 4272
in narrative form or otherwise, that it considers necessary or 4273
as the juvenile court requests, to the juvenile court for 4274
further proceedings, and, upon the certification, the juvenile 4275
court has exclusive jurisdiction. 4276
(E)(1)(a) The court shall not modify a prior decree 4277
allocating parental rights and responsibilities for the care of 4278
children unless it finds, based on facts that have arisen since 4279
the prior decree or that were unknown to the court at the time 4280
of the prior decree, that a change has occurred in the 4281
circumstances of the child, the child's residential parent, or 4282
either of the parents subject to a shared parenting decree, and 4283
that the modification is necessary to serve the best interest of 4284
the child. In applying these standards, the court shall retain 4285
the residential parent designated by the prior decree or the 4286
S. B. No. 174 Page 145

prior shared parenting decree, unless a modification is in the 4287
best interest of the child and one of the following applies: 4288
(i) The residential parent agrees to a change in the 4289
residential parent or both parents under a shared parenting 4290
decree agree to a change in the designation of residential 4291
parent. 4292
(ii) The child, with the consent of the residential parent 4293
or of both parents under a shared parenting decree, has been 4294
integrated into the family of the person seeking to become the 4295
residential parent. 4296
(iii) The harm likely to be caused by a change of 4297
environment is outweighed by the advantages of the change of 4298
environment to the child. 4299
(b) One or both of the parents under a prior decree 4300
allocating parental rights and responsibilities for the care of 4301
children that is not a shared parenting decree may file a motion 4302
requesting that the prior decree be modified to give both 4303
parents shared rights and responsibilities for the care of the 4304
children. The motion shall include both a request for 4305
modification of the prior decree and a request for a shared 4306
parenting order that complies with division (G) of this section. 4307
Upon the filing of the motion, if the court determines that a 4308
modification of the prior decree is authorized under division 4309
(E)(1)(a) of this section, the court may modify the prior decree 4310
to grant a shared parenting order, provided that the court shall 4311
not modify the prior decree to grant a shared parenting order 4312
unless the court complies with divisions (A) and (D)(1) of this 4313

Section 167:
section and, in accordance with those divisions, approves the 4314

(2) In addition to a modification authorized under 4317
division (E)(1) of this section: 4318
(a) Both parents under a shared parenting decree jointly 4319
may modify the terms of the plan for shared parenting approved 4320
by the court and incorporated by it into the shared parenting 4321
decree. Modifications under this division may be made at any 4322
time. The modifications to the plan shall be filed jointly by 4323
both parents with the court, and the court shall include them in 4324
the plan, unless they are not in the best interest of the 4325
children. If the modifications are not in the best interests of 4326
the children, the court, in its discretion, may reject the 4327
modifications or make modifications to the proposed 4328
modifications or the plan that are in the best interest of the 4329
children. Modifications jointly submitted by both parents under 4330
a shared parenting decree shall be effective, either as 4331
originally filed or as modified by the court, upon their 4332
inclusion by the court in the plan. Modifications to the plan 4333
made by the court shall be effective upon their inclusion by the 4334
court in the plan. 4335
(b) The court may modify the terms of the plan for shared 4336
parenting approved by the court and incorporated by it into the 4337
shared parenting decree upon its own motion at any time if the 4338
court determines that the modifications are in the best interest 4339
of the children or upon the request of one or both of the 4340
parents under the decree. Modifications under this division may 4341
be made at any time. The court shall not make any modification 4342
to the plan under this division, unless the modification is in 4343

proceed and issue a modified decree for the allocation of 4364
parental rights and responsibilities for the care of the 4365
children under the standards applicable under divisions (A), 4366

growth of their children; 6822

and responsibilities with respect to the child in a divorce, 6824

other proceeding addressing pertaining to the allocation of 6826

should be minimized as much as possible. 6837
(c) Whenever appropriate, parents should be encouraged to 6838
meet their responsibilities to their children through agreements 6839
rather than by relying on judicial intervention. 6840
(d) When a parenting plan provides for mutual decision- 6841
making responsibility by the parents but they are unable to make 6842
decisions mutually, they should make a good faith effort to 6843
utilize the mediation process as required by the parenting plan. 6844
(e) In apportioning between the parents the daily physical 6845
living arrangements of the child and the child's location during 6846
legal and school holidays, vacations, and days of special 6847
importance, a court should not impose any type of standard 6848
schedule unless a standard schedule meets the needs of the child 6849
better than any proposed alternative parenting plan. 6850
(B) It is, therefore, the purpose public policy of this 6851
chapter, when it is in the child's best interest, to : 6852
(1) To foster and continue the relationship between the 6853
child and each parent when a court allocates parental rights and 6854
parenting responsibilities with respect to the child in a 6855
divorce, dissolution, legal separation, annulment, or any other 6856
proceeding addressing the allocation of parental rights and 6857
responsibilities; 6858

Sec. 3902.13. (A) A plan of health coverage determines its 11287
order of benefits using the first of the following that applies: 11288
(1) A plan that does not coordinate with other plans is 11289
always the primary plan. 11290
(2) The benefits of the plan that covers a person as an 11291
employee, member, insured, or subscriber, other than a 11292
dependent, is the primary plan. The plan that covers the person 11293
as a dependent is the secondary plan. 11294
(3) When more than one plan covers the same child as a 11295
dependent of different parents who are not divorced or 11296
separated, the primary plan is the plan of the parent whose 11297
birthday falls earlier in the year. The secondary plan is the 11298
plan of the parent whose birthday falls later in the year. If 11299
both parents have the same birthday, the benefits of the plan 11300
that covered the parent the longer is the primary plan. The plan 11301
that covered the parent the shorter time is the secondary plan. 11302
If the other plan's provision for coordination of benefits does 11303
not include the rule contained in this division because it is 11304
not subject to regulation under this division, but instead has a 11305
rule based on the gender of the parent, and if, as a result, the 11306
plans do not agree on the order of benefits, the rule of the 11307
other plan will determine the order of benefits. 11308

(4)(a) Except as provided in division (A)(4)(b) of this 11309

Section 430:
section, if more than one plan covers a person as a dependent 11310
child of divorced or separated parents, benefits for the child 11311
are determined in the following order: 11312
(i) The plan of the parent who is the residential 11313
designated parent and legal custodian of the child; 11314
(ii) The plan of the spouse of the parent who is the 11315
residential designated parent and legal custodian of the child; 11316
(iii) The plan of the parent who is not the residential 11317
designated parent and legal custodian of the child. 11318
(b) If the specific terms of a court decree state that one 11319
parent is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, 11320
the plan of that parent is the primary plan. A parent 11321
responsible for the health care pursuant to a court decree must 11322
notify the insurer or health insuring corporation of the terms 11323
of the decree. 11324
(5) The primary plan is the plan that covers a person as 11325
an employee who is neither laid off or retired, or that 11326
employee's dependent. The secondary plan is the plan that covers 11327
that person as a laid-off or retired employee, or that 11328
employee's dependent. 11329
(6) If none of the rules in divisions (A)(1), (2), (3), 11330
(4), and (5) of this section determines the order of benefits, 11331
the primary plan is the plan that covered an employee, member, 11332
insured, or subscriber longer. The secondary plan is the plan 11333
that covered that person the shorter time. 11334
(B) When a plan of health coverage is determined to be a 11335
secondary plan it acts to provide benefits in excess of those 11336
provided by the primary plan. 11337
S. B. No. 174 Page 387
As Introduced
(C) The secondary plan shall not be required to make 11338
payment in an amount which exceeds the amount it would have paid 11339
if it were the primary plan, but in no event, when combined with 11340
the amount paid by the primary plan, shall payments by the 11341
secondary plan exceed one hundred per cent of expenses allowable 11342
under the provisions of the applicable policies and contracts. 11343
(D) A third-party payer may require a beneficiary to file 11344
a claim with the primary plan before it determines the amount of 11345
its payment obligation, if any, with regard to that claim. 11346
(E) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require 11347
a plan to make a payment until it determines whether it is the 11348
primary plan or the secondary plan and what benefits are payable 11349
under the primary plan. 11350
(F) A plan may obtain any facts and information necessary 11351
to apply the provisions of this section, or supply this 11352
information to any other third-party payer or provider, or any 11353
agent of such third-party payer or provider, without the consent 11354
of the beneficiary. Each person claiming benefits under the plan 11355
shall provide any information necessary to apply the provisions 11356
of this section. 11357
(G) If the amount of payments made by any plan is more 11358
than should have been paid, the plan may recover the excess from 11359
whichever party received the excess payment. 11360

preserve the health and well-being of any child concerning whom 1138
a complaint or an application for care has been filed, pending 1139
the service of a citation upon the child's parents, guardian, or 1140

custodian, if the court finds the parents, guardian, or 1142
custodian able to do so, to reimburse the court for the expense 1143
involved in providing the emergency medical or surgical 1144

furnished to a child who is found at the hearing to be a 1148
nonresident of the county in which the court is located and if 1149
the expense of the medical or surgical treatment cannot be 1150
recovered from the parents, legal guardian, or custodian of the 1151
child, the board of county commissioners of the county in which 1152
the child has a legal settlement shall reimburse the court for 1153
the reasonable cost of the emergency medical or surgical 1154
treatment out of its general fund. 1155

from seeking consent to obtain copies of a missing child's 3746
dental records, or prevent a missing child's parents, parent who 3747
is the residential designated parent and legal custodian, 3748
guardian, or legal custodian, or any other person responsible 3749
for the care of the missing child, from granting consent for the 3750

child's parents, parent who is the residential designated parent 3764

spouse may convert the action for dissolution of marriage into a 3953
divorce action by filing a motion with the court in which the 3954
action for dissolution of marriage is pending for conversion of 3955
the action for dissolution of marriage. The motion shall contain 3956
a complaint for divorce that contains grounds for a divorce and 3957
that otherwise complies with the Rules of Civil Procedure and 3958
this chapter. The divorce action then shall proceed in 3959
accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure in the same manner 3960
as if the motion had been the original complaint in the action, 3961
including, but not limited to, the issuance and service of 3962
summons pursuant to Civil Rules 4 to 4.6, except that no court 3963

Sec. 3109.04. (A) In any divorce, legal separation, or 3979
annulment proceeding and in any proceeding pertaining to the 3980
allocation of parental rights and responsibilities for the care 3981
of a child, upon hearing the testimony of either or both parents 3982
and considering any mediation report filed pursuant to section 3983
3109.052 of the Revised Code and in accordance with sections 3984
3127.01 to 3127.53 of the Revised Code, the court shall allocate 3985
the parental rights and responsibilities for the care of the 3986
minor children of the marriage. Subject to division (D)(2) of 3987
this section, the court may allocate the parental rights and 3988
responsibilities for the care of the children in either of the 3989
following ways: 3990
(1) If neither parent files a pleading or motion in 3991
accordance with division (G) of this section, if at least one 3992
parent files a pleading or motion under that division but no 3993
parent who filed a pleading or motion under that division also 3994
files a plan for shared parenting, or if at least one parent 3995
files both a pleading or motion and a shared parenting plan 3996
under that division but no plan for shared parenting is in the 3997
best interest of the children, the court, in a manner consistent 3998
with the best interest of the children, shall allocate the 3999
parental rights and responsibilities for the care of the 4000
children primarily to one of the parents, designate that parent 4001
as the residential parent and the legal custodian of the child, 4002
and divide between the parents the other rights and 4003
responsibilities for the care of the children, including, but 4004
not limited to, the responsibility to provide support for the 4005
children and the right of the parent who is not the residential 4006
parent to have continuing contact with the children. 4007

shared parenting pursuant to that division and if a plan for 4010
shared parenting is in the best interest of the children and is 4011
approved by the court in accordance with division (D)(1) of this 4012
section, the court may allocate the parental rights and 4013
responsibilities for the care of the children to both parents 4014
and issue a shared parenting order requiring the parents to 4015
share all or some of the aspects of the physical and legal care 4016
of the children in accordance with the approved plan for shared 4017
parenting. If the court issues a shared parenting order under 4018
this division and it is necessary for the purpose of receiving 4019
public assistance, the court shall designate which one of the 4020
parents' residences is to serve as the child's home. The child 4021
support obligations of the parents under a shared parenting 4022
order issued under this division shall be determined in 4023
accordance with Chapters 3119., 3121., 3123., and 3125. of the 4024
Revised Code. 4025
(B)(1) When making the allocation of the parental rights 4026
and responsibilities for the care of the children under this 4027
section in an original proceeding or in any proceeding for 4028
modification of a prior order of the court making the 4029
allocation, the court shall take into account that which would 4030
be in the best interest of the children. In determining the 4031
child's best interest for purposes of making its allocation of 4032
the parental rights and responsibilities for the care of the 4033
child and for purposes of resolving any issues related to the 4034
making of that allocation, the court, in its discretion, may 4035
and, upon the request of either party, shall interview in 4036
chambers any or all of the involved children regarding their 4037
wishes and concerns with respect to the allocation. 4038

of either parent, shall appoint a guardian ad litem for the 4042
child. 4043
(b) The court first shall determine the reasoning ability 4044
of the child. If the court determines that the child does not 4045
have sufficient reasoning ability to express the child's wishes 4046
and concern with respect to the allocation of parental rights 4047
and responsibilities for the care of the child, it shall not 4048
determine the child's wishes and concerns with respect to the 4049
allocation. If the court determines that the child has 4050
sufficient reasoning ability to express the child's wishes or 4051
concerns with respect to the allocation, it then shall determine 4052
whether, because of special circumstances, it would not be in 4053
the best interest of the child to determine the child's wishes 4054
and concerns with respect to the allocation. If the court 4055
determines that, because of special circumstances, it would not 4056
be in the best interest of the child to determine the child's 4057
wishes and concerns with respect to the allocation, it shall not 4058
determine the child's wishes and concerns with respect to the 4059
allocation and shall enter its written findings of fact and 4060
opinion in the journal. If the court determines that it would be 4061
in the best interests of the child to determine the child's 4062
wishes and concerns with respect to the allocation, it shall 4063
proceed to make that determination. 4064
(c) The interview shall be conducted in chambers, and no 4065
person other than the child, the child's attorney, the judge, 4066
any necessary court personnel, and, in the judge's discretion, 4067
the attorney of each parent shall be permitted to be present in 4068
the chambers during the interview. 4069

court, in determining the child's best interest for purposes of 4074
making its allocation of the parental rights and 4075
responsibilities for the care of the child or for purposes of 4076
resolving any issues related to the making of that allocation, 4077
shall accept or consider a written or recorded statement or 4078
affidavit that purports to set forth the child's wishes and 4079
concerns regarding those matters. 4080
(C) Prior to trial, the court may cause an investigation 4081
to be made as to the character, family relations, past conduct, 4082
earning ability, and financial worth of each parent and may 4083
order the parents and their minor children to submit to medical, 4084
psychological, and psychiatric examinations. The report of the 4085
investigation and examinations shall be made available to either 4086
parent or the parent's counsel of record not less than five days 4087
before trial, upon written request. The report shall be signed 4088
by the investigator, and the investigator shall be subject to 4089
cross-examination by either parent concerning the contents of 4090
the report. The court may tax as costs all or any part of the 4091
expenses for each investigation. 4092
If the court determines that either parent previously has 4093
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any criminal offense 4094
involving any act that resulted in a child being a neglected 4095
child, that either parent previously has been determined to be 4096
the perpetrator of the neglectful act that is the basis of an 4097
adjudication that a child is a neglected child, or that there is 4098
reason to believe that either parent has acted in a manner 4099
resulting in a child being a neglected child, the court shall 4100
consider that fact against naming that parent the residential 4101

court allocates parental rights and responsibilities for the 4103
care of children or determines whether to grant shared parenting 4104
in any proceeding, it shall consider whether either parent or 4105
any member of the household of either parent has been convicted 4106
of or pleaded guilty to a violation of section 2919.25 of the 4107
Revised Code or a sexually oriented offense involving a victim 4108
who at the time of the commission of the offense was a member of 4109
the family or household that is the subject of the proceeding, 4110
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any sexually oriented 4111
offense or other offense involving a victim who at the time of 4112
the commission of the offense was a member of the family or 4113
household that is the subject of the proceeding and caused 4114
physical harm to the victim in the commission of the offense, or 4115
has been determined to be the perpetrator of the abusive act 4116
that is the basis of an adjudication that a child is an abused 4117
child. If the court determines that either parent has been 4118
convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of section 2919.25 4119
of the Revised Code or a sexually oriented offense involving a 4120
victim who at the time of the commission of the offense was a 4121
member of the family or household that is the subject of the 4122
proceeding, has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any 4123
sexually oriented offense or other offense involving a victim 4124
who at the time of the commission of the offense was a member of 4125
the family or household that is the subject of the proceeding 4126
and caused physical harm to the victim in the commission of the 4127
offense, or has been determined to be the perpetrator of the 4128
abusive act that is the basis of an adjudication that a child is 4129
an abused child, it may designate that parent as the residential 4130
parent and may issue a shared parenting decree or order only if 4131

(D)(1)(a) Upon the filing of a pleading or motion by 4136
either parent or both parents, in accordance with division (G) 4137
of this section, requesting shared parenting and the filing of a 4138
shared parenting plan in accordance with that division, the 4139
court shall comply with division (D)(1)(a)(i), (ii), or (iii) of 4140
this section, whichever is applicable: 4141
(i) If both parents jointly make the request in their 4142
pleadings or jointly file the motion and also jointly file the 4143
plan, the court shall review the parents' plan to determine if 4144
it is in the best interest of the children. If the court 4145
determines that the plan is in the best interest of the 4146
children, the court shall approve it. If the court determines 4147
that the plan or any part of the plan is not in the best 4148
interest of the children, the court shall require the parents to 4149
make appropriate changes to the plan to meet the court's 4150
objections to it. If changes to the plan are made to meet the 4151
court's objections, and if the new plan is in the best interest 4152
of the children, the court shall approve the plan. If changes to 4153
the plan are not made to meet the court's objections, or if the 4154
parents attempt to make changes to the plan to meet the court's 4155
objections, but the court determines that the new plan or any 4156
part of the new plan still is not in the best interest of the 4157
children, the court may reject the portion of the parents' 4158
pleadings or deny their motion requesting shared parenting of 4159
the children and proceed as if the request in the pleadings or 4160
the motion had not been made. The court shall not approve a plan 4161
under this division unless it determines that the plan is in the 4162
best interest of the children. 4163

(ii) If each parent makes a request in the parent's 4164
pleadings or files a motion and each also files a separate plan, 4165
the court shall review each plan filed to determine if either is 4166
in the best interest of the children. If the court determines 4167
that one of the filed plans is in the best interest of the 4168
children, the court may approve the plan. If the court 4169
determines that neither filed plan is in the best interest of 4170
the children, the court may order each parent to submit 4171
appropriate changes to the parent's plan or both of the filed 4172
plans to meet the court's objections, or may select one of the 4173
filed plans and order each parent to submit appropriate changes 4174
to the selected plan to meet the court's objections. If changes 4175
to the plan or plans are submitted to meet the court's 4176
objections, and if any of the filed plans with the changes is in 4177
the best interest of the children, the court may approve the 4178
plan with the changes. If changes to the plan or plans are not 4179
submitted to meet the court's objections, or if the parents 4180
submit changes to the plan or plans to meet the court's 4181
objections but the court determines that none of the filed plans 4182
with the submitted changes is in the best interest of the 4183
children, the court may reject the portion of the parents' 4184
pleadings or deny their motions requesting shared parenting of 4185
the children and proceed as if the requests in the pleadings or 4186
the motions had not been made. If the court approves a plan 4187
under this division, either as originally filed or with 4188
submitted changes, or if the court rejects the portion of the 4189
parents' pleadings or denies their motions requesting shared 4190
parenting under this division and proceeds as if the requests in 4191
the pleadings or the motions had not been made, the court shall 4192
enter in the record of the case findings of fact and conclusions 4193
of law as to the reasons for the approval or the rejection or 4194
denial. Division (D)(1)(b) of this section applies in relation 4195

pleadings or files a motion but only one parent files a plan, or 4198
if only one parent makes a request in the parent's pleadings or 4199
files a motion and also files a plan, the court in the best 4200
interest of the children may order the other parent to file a 4201
plan for shared parenting in accordance with division (G) of 4202
this section. The court shall review each plan filed to 4203
determine if any plan is in the best interest of the children. 4204
If the court determines that one of the filed plans is in the 4205
best interest of the children, the court may approve the plan. 4206
If the court determines that no filed plan is in the best 4207
interest of the children, the court may order each parent to 4208
submit appropriate changes to the parent's plan or both of the 4209
filed plans to meet the court's objections or may select one 4210
filed plan and order each parent to submit appropriate changes 4211
to the selected plan to meet the court's objections. If changes 4212
to the plan or plans are submitted to meet the court's 4213
objections, and if any of the filed plans with the changes is in 4214
the best interest of the children, the court may approve the 4215
plan with the changes. If changes to the plan or plans are not 4216
submitted to meet the court's objections, or if the parents 4217
submit changes to the plan or plans to meet the court's 4218
objections but the court determines that none of the filed plans 4219
with the submitted changes is in the best interest of the 4220
children, the court may reject the portion of the parents' 4221
pleadings or deny the parents' motion or reject the portion of 4222
the parents' pleadings or deny their motions requesting shared 4223
parenting of the children and proceed as if the request or 4224
requests or the motion or motions had not been made. If the 4225
court approves a plan under this division, either as originally 4226

filed or with submitted changes, or if the court rejects the 4227
portion of the pleadings or denies the motion or motions 4228
requesting shared parenting under this division and proceeds as 4229
if the request or requests or the motion or motions had not been 4230
made, the court shall enter in the record of the case findings 4231
of fact and conclusions of law as to the reasons for the 4232
approval or the rejection or denial. Division (D)(1)(b) of this 4233
section applies in relation to the approval or disapproval of a 4234
plan under this division. 4235
(b) The approval of a plan under division (D)(1)(a)(ii) or 4236
(iii) of this section is discretionary with the court. The court 4237
shall not approve more than one plan under either division and 4238
shall not approve a plan under either division unless it 4239
determines that the plan is in the best interest of the 4240
children. If the court, under either division, does not 4241
determine that any filed plan or any filed plan with submitted 4242
changes is in the best interest of the children, the court shall 4243
not approve any plan. 4244
(c) Whenever possible, the court shall require that a 4245
shared parenting plan approved under division (D)(1)(a)(i), 4246
(ii), or (iii) of this section ensure the opportunity for both 4247
parents to have frequent and continuing contact with the child, 4248
unless frequent and continuing contact with any parent would not 4249
be in the best interest of the child. 4250
(d) If a court approves a shared parenting plan under 4251
division (D)(1)(a)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, the 4252
approved plan shall be incorporated into a final shared 4253
parenting decree granting the parents the shared parenting of 4254
the children. Any final shared parenting decree shall be issued 4255
at the same time as and shall be appended to the final decree of 4256

S. B. No. 174 Page 144

dissolution, divorce, annulment, or legal separation arising out 4257
of the action out of which the question of the allocation of 4258
parental rights and responsibilities for the care of the 4259
children arose. 4260
No provisional shared parenting decree shall be issued in 4261
relation to any shared parenting plan approved under division 4262
(D)(1)(a)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section. A final shared 4263
parenting decree issued under this division has immediate effect 4264
as a final decree on the date of its issuance, subject to 4265
modification or termination as authorized by this section. 4266
(2) If the court finds, with respect to any child under 4267
eighteen years of age, that it is in the best interest of the 4268
child for neither parent to be designated the residential parent 4269
and legal custodian of the child, it may commit the child to a 4270
relative of the child or certify a copy of its findings, 4271
together with as much of the record and the further information, 4272
in narrative form or otherwise, that it considers necessary or 4273
as the juvenile court requests, to the juvenile court for 4274
further proceedings, and, upon the certification, the juvenile 4275
court has exclusive jurisdiction. 4276
(E)(1)(a) The court shall not modify a prior decree 4277
allocating parental rights and responsibilities for the care of 4278
children unless it finds, based on facts that have arisen since 4279
the prior decree or that were unknown to the court at the time 4280
of the prior decree, that a change has occurred in the 4281
circumstances of the child, the child's residential parent, or 4282
either of the parents subject to a shared parenting decree, and 4283
that the modification is necessary to serve the best interest of 4284
the child. In applying these standards, the court shall retain 4285
the residential parent designated by the prior decree or the 4286

S. B. No. 174 Page 145
As Introduced
prior shared parenting decree, unless a modification is in the 4287
best interest of the child and one of the following applies: 4288
(i) The residential parent agrees to a change in the 4289
residential parent or both parents under a shared parenting 4290
decree agree to a change in the designation of residential 4291
parent. 4292
(ii) The child, with the consent of the residential parent 4293
or of both parents under a shared parenting decree, has been 4294
integrated into the family of the person seeking to become the 4295
residential parent. 4296
(iii) The harm likely to be caused by a change of 4297
environment is outweighed by the advantages of the change of 4298
environment to the child. 4299
(b) One or both of the parents under a prior decree 4300
allocating parental rights and responsibilities for the care of 4301
children that is not a shared parenting decree may file a motion 4302
requesting that the prior decree be modified to give both 4303
parents shared rights and responsibilities for the care of the 4304
children. The motion shall include both a request for 4305
modification of the prior decree and a request for a shared 4306
parenting order that complies with division (G) of this section. 4307
Upon the filing of the motion, if the court determines that a 4308
modification of the prior decree is authorized under division 4309
(E)(1)(a) of this section, the court may modify the prior decree 4310
to grant a shared parenting order, provided that the court shall 4311
not modify the prior decree to grant a shared parenting order 4312
unless the court complies with divisions (A) and (D)(1) of this 4313
section and, in accordance with those divisions, approves the 4314
submitted shared parenting plan and determines that shared 4315
parenting would be in the best interest of the children. 4316

(2) In addition to a modification authorized under 4317
division (E)(1) of this section: 4318
(a) Both parents under a shared parenting decree jointly 4319
may modify the terms of the plan for shared parenting approved 4320
by the court and incorporated by it into the shared parenting 4321
decree. Modifications under this division may be made at any 4322
time. The modifications to the plan shall be filed jointly by 4323
both parents with the court, and the court shall include them in 4324
the plan, unless they are not in the best interest of the 4325
children. If the modifications are not in the best interests of 4326
the children, the court, in its discretion, may reject the 4327
modifications or make modifications to the proposed 4328
modifications or the plan that are in the best interest of the 4329
children. Modifications jointly submitted by both parents under 4330
a shared parenting decree shall be effective, either as 4331
originally filed or as modified by the court, upon their 4332
inclusion by the court in the plan. Modifications to the plan 4333
made by the court shall be effective upon their inclusion by the 4334
court in the plan. 4335
(b) The court may modify the terms of the plan for shared 4336
parenting approved by the court and incorporated by it into the 4337
shared parenting decree upon its own motion at any time if the 4338
court determines that the modifications are in the best interest 4339
of the children or upon the request of one or both of the 4340
parents under the decree. Modifications under this division may 4341
be made at any time. The court shall not make any modification 4342
to the plan under this division, unless the modification is in 4343
the best interest of the children. 4344
(c) The court may terminate a prior final shared parenting 4345
decree that includes a shared parenting plan approved under 4346

division (D)(1)(a)(i) of this section upon the request of one or 4347
both of the parents or whenever it determines that shared 4348
parenting is not in the best interest of the children. The court 4349
may terminate a prior final shared parenting decree that 4350
includes a shared parenting plan approved under division (D)(1) 4351
(a)(ii) or (iii) of this section if it determines, upon its own 4352
motion or upon the request of one or both parents, that shared 4353
parenting is not in the best interest of the children. If 4354
modification of the terms of the plan for shared parenting 4355
approved by the court and incorporated by it into the final 4356
shared parenting decree is attempted under division (E)(2)(a) of 4357

(d) Upon the termination of a prior final shared parenting 4362
decree under division (E)(2)(c) of this section, the court shall 4363
proceed and issue a modified decree for the allocation of 4364
parental rights and responsibilities for the care of the 4365
children under the standards applicable under divisions (A), 4366
(B), and (C) of this section as if no decree for shared 4367
parenting had been granted and as if no request for shared 4368
parenting ever had been made. 4369
(F)(1) In determining the best interest of a child 4370
pursuant to this section, whether on an original decree 4371
allocating parental rights and responsibilities for the care of 4372
children or a modification of a decree allocating those rights 4373
and responsibilities, the court shall consider all relevant 4374

an abused child or a neglected child, previously has been 4402
determined to be the perpetrator of the abusive or neglectful 4403
act that is the basis of an adjudication; whether either parent 4404

one parent files a plan or if only one parent files a pleading 4456
or motion requesting shared parenting and also files a plan, the 4457
other parent as ordered by the court shall file with the court a 4458

grants or modifies a decree allocating parental rights and 4475
responsibilities for the care of children, the court of appeals 4476
shall give the case calendar priority and handle it 4477
expeditiously. 4478
(I)(1) Upon receipt of an order for active military 4479

parental rights and responsibilities unless the court determines 4500
that there has been a change in circumstances of the child, the 4501
child's residential parent, or either of the parents subject to 4502
a shared parenting decree, and that modification is necessary to 4503
serve the best interest of the child. The court shall not find 4504
past, present, or possible future active military service in the 4505
uniformed services to constitute a change in circumstances 4506
justifying modification of a prior decree pursuant to division 4507
(E) of this section. The court shall make specific written 4508
findings of fact to support any modification under this 4509
division. 4510
(3) Nothing in division (I) of this section shall prevent 4511
a court from issuing a temporary order allocating or modifying 4512
parental rights and responsibilities for the duration of the 4513
parent's active military service. A temporary order shall 4514
specify whether the parent's active military service is the 4515
basis of the order and shall provide for termination of the 4516
temporary order and resumption of the prior order within ten 4517
days after receipt of notice pursuant to division (I)(5) of this 4518
section, unless the other parent demonstrates that resumption of 4519
the prior order is not in the child's best interest. 4520

(e) In apportioning between the parents the daily physical 6845
living arrangements of the child and the child's location during 6846

evidence, the court determines that the petitioner has committed 8103
an act of domestic violence or has violated a temporary 8104
protection order issued pursuant to section 2919.26 of the 8105

Revised Code or division (E)(1)(d) of this section or a 8120
visitation or companionship or visitation order issued pursuant 8121
to section 3109.051, 3109.054, 3109.11, or 3109.12 of the 8122
Revised Code or division (E)(1)(d) of this section granting 8123
parenting time rights to the respondent, the court may require 8124
the public children services agency of the county in which the 8125
court is located to provide supervision of the respondent's 8126
exercise of parenting time under a parenting plan or visitation 8127
or companionship or visitation rights with respect to the child 8128

(i) The child is in danger from the respondent; 8131

S. B. No. 174 Page 277

(ii) No other person or agency is available to provide the 8132

approved under this section includes a requirement that the 8140
respondent be evicted from or vacate the residence or household 8141
or refrain from entering the residence, school, business, or 8142
place of employment of the petitioner or, with respect to a 8143
petition involving family or household members, a family or 8144
household member, the order or agreement shall state clearly 8145
that the order or agreement cannot be waived or nullified by an 8146
invitation to the respondent from the petitioner or other family 8147
or household member to enter the residence, school, business, or 8148
place of employment or by the respondent's entry into one of 8149
those places otherwise upon the consent of the petitioner or 8150
other family or household member. 8151
(b) Division (E)(7)(a) of this section does not limit any 8152
discretion of a court to determine that a respondent charged 8153
with a violation of section 2919.27 of the Revised Code, with a 8154
violation of a municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to 8155
that section, or with contempt of court, which charge is based 8156

motion for modification or termination of a protection order or 8169
consent agreement that was issued or approved after a full 8170
hearing. The court shall require notice of the motion to be made 8171
as provided by the Rules of Civil Procedure. If the petitioner 8172
for the original protection order or consent agreement has 8173
requested that the petitioner's address be kept confidential, 8174
the court shall not disclose the address to the respondent of 8175
the original protection order or consent agreement or any other 8176
person, except as otherwise required by law. The moving party 8177
has the burden of proof to show, by a preponderance of the 8178
evidence, that modification or termination of the protection 8179
order or consent agreement is appropriate because either the 8180
protection order or consent agreement is no longer needed or 8181
because the terms of the original protection order or consent 8182
agreement are no longer appropriate. 8183
(c) In considering whether to modify or terminate a 8184
protection order or consent agreement issued or approved under 8185
this section, the court shall consider all relevant factors, 8186

conditions of the original protection order or consent 8198
agreement; 8199
(vi) Whether the respondent has a continuing involvement 8200
with illegal drugs or alcohol; 8201
(vii) Whether the respondent has been convicted of, 8202
pleaded guilty to, or been adjudicated a delinquent child for an 8203
offense of violence since the issuance of the protection order 8204
or approval of the consent agreement; 8205
(viii) Whether any other protection orders, consent 8206
agreements, restraining orders, or no contact orders have been 8207
issued against the respondent pursuant to this section, section 8208
2919.26 of the Revised Code, any other provision of state law, 8209
or the law of any other state; 8210
(ix) Whether the respondent has participated in any 8211
domestic violence treatment, intervention program, or other 8212
counseling addressing domestic violence and whether the 8213
respondent has completed the treatment, program, or counseling; 8214
(x) The time that has elapsed since the protection order 8215
was issued or since the consent agreement was approved; 8216
(xi) The age and health of the respondent; 8217
(xii) When the last incident of abuse, threat of harm, or 8218

relevant information concerning the safety and protection of the 8220
petitioner or other protected parties. 8221
(d) If a protection order or consent agreement is modified 8222
or terminated as provided in division (E)(8) of this section, 8223
the court shall issue copies of the modified or terminated order 8224
or agreement as provided in division (F) of this section. A 8225
petitioner may also provide notice of the modification or 8226
termination to the judicial and law enforcement officials in any 8227
county other than the county in which the order or agreement is 8228
modified or terminated as provided in division (N) of this 8229
section. 8230
(e) If the respondent moves for modification or 8231
termination of a protection order or consent agreement pursuant 8232
to this section and the court denies the motion, the court may 8233
assess costs against the respondent for the filing of the 8234
motion. 8235
(9) Any protection order issued or any consent agreement 8236
approved pursuant to this section shall include a provision that 8237
the court will automatically seal all of the records of the 8238
proceeding in which the order is issued or agreement approved on 8239
the date the respondent attains the age of nineteen years unless 8240
the petitioner provides the court with evidence that the 8241
respondent has not complied with all of the terms of the 8242
protection order or consent agreement. The protection order or 8243
consent agreement shall specify the date when the respondent 8244
attains the age of nineteen years. 8245

agencies that have jurisdiction to enforce the order or 8250
agreement. The court shall direct that a copy of an order be 8251
delivered to the respondent on the same day that the order is 8252
entered. 8253
(2) Upon the issuance of a protection order or the 8254
approval of a consent agreement under this section, the court 8255
shall provide the parties to the order or agreement with the 8256
following notice orally or by form: 8257
"NOTICE 8258
As a result of this order or consent agreement, it may be 8259
unlawful for you to possess or purchase a firearm, including a 8260
rifle, pistol, or revolver, or ammunition pursuant to federal 8261
law under 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(8) for the duration of this order or 8262
consent agreement. If you have any questions whether this law 8263
makes it illegal for you to possess or purchase a firearm or 8264
ammunition, you should consult an attorney." 8265
(3) All law enforcement agencies shall establish and 8266
maintain an index for the protection orders and the approved 8267
consent agreements delivered to the agencies pursuant to 8268
division (F)(1) of this section. With respect to each order and 8269
consent agreement delivered, each agency shall note on the index 8270

agreement. 8272
(4) Regardless of whether the petitioner has registered 8273
the order or agreement in the county in which the officer's 8274
agency has jurisdiction pursuant to division (N) of this 8275
section, any officer of a law enforcement agency shall enforce a 8276

(G)(1) Any proceeding under this section shall be 8281
conducted in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure, 8282
except that an order under this section may be obtained with or 8283
without bond. An order issued under this section, other than an 8284
ex parte order, that grants a protection order or approves a 8285
consent agreement, that refuses to grant a protection order or 8286
approve a consent agreement that modifies or terminates a 8287
protection order or consent agreement, or that refuses to modify 8288
or terminate a protection order or consent agreement, is a 8289
final, appealable order. The remedies and procedures provided in 8290
this section are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other 8291
available civil or criminal remedies. 8292
(2) If as provided in division (G)(1) of this section an 8293
order issued under this section, other than an ex parte order, 8294
refuses to grant a protection order, the court, on its own 8295

excuse a person from filing any report or giving any notice 8303
required by section 2151.421 of the Revised Code or by any other 8304
law. When a petition under this section alleges domestic 8305
violence against minor children, the court shall report the 8306

the relief available under this section and, for family or 8314
household members, section 2919.26 of the Revised Code. 8315
(J)(1) Subject to divisions (E)(8)(e) and (J)(2) of this 8316

this section or in connection with the filing, issuance, 8322

subpoena or for obtaining a certified copy of a protection order 8325

(2) Regardless of whether a protection order is issued or 8327
a consent agreement is approved pursuant to this section, the 8328
court may assess costs against the respondent in connection with 8329
the filing, issuance, registration, modification, enforcement, 8330
dismissal, withdrawal, or service of a protection order, consent 8331
agreement, or witness subpoena or for obtaining a certified copy 8332
of a protection order or consent agreement. 8333
(K)(1) The court shall comply with Chapters 3119., 3121., 8334

a consent agreement approved under this section is subject to 8348
the following sanctions: 8349

(b) Punishment for contempt of court. 8354
(2) The punishment of a person for contempt of court for 8355
violation of a protection order issued or a consent agreement 8356

the person or a delinquent child proceeding concerning the 8358
person for a violation of section 2919.27 of the Revised Code. 8359
However, a person punished for contempt of court is entitled to 8360
credit for the punishment imposed upon conviction of or 8361
adjudication as a delinquent child for a violation of that 8362
section, and a person convicted of or adjudicated a delinquent 8363
child for a violation of that section shall not subsequently be 8364

the payments for child support are substantially current as 8802
ordered by the court for the year in which the children will be 8803
claimed as dependents. In cases in which the parties do not 8804

savings, the relative financial circumstances and needs of the 8807

each parent, the eligibility of either or both parents for the 8809

children as dependents for federal income tax purposes, it shall 8815
order the residential designated parent to take whatever action 8816

enable the parent who is not the residential designated parent 8819
and legal custodian to claim the children as dependents for 8820

Revised Code, a person's status as a registered patient or 11258
caregiver is not a sufficient basis for conducting a field 11259

Sec. 3902.13. (A) A plan of health coverage determines its 11287
order of benefits using the first of the following that applies: 11288
(1) A plan that does not coordinate with other plans is 11289
always the primary plan. 11290
(2) The benefits of the plan that covers a person as an 11291
employee, member, insured, or subscriber, other than a 11292
dependent, is the primary plan. The plan that covers the person 11293
as a dependent is the secondary plan. 11294
(3) When more than one plan covers the same child as a 11295
dependent of different parents who are not divorced or 11296
separated, the primary plan is the plan of the parent whose 11297
birthday falls earlier in the year. The secondary plan is the 11298
plan of the parent whose birthday falls later in the year. If 11299
both parents have the same birthday, the benefits of the plan 11300
that covered the parent the longer is the primary plan. The plan 11301
that covered the parent the shorter time is the secondary plan. 11302
If the other plan's provision for coordination of benefits does 11303
not include the rule contained in this division because it is 11304
not subject to regulation under this division, but instead has a 11305
rule based on the gender of the parent, and if, as a result, the 11306
plans do not agree on the order of benefits, the rule of the 11307
other plan will determine the order of benefits. 11308

S. B. No. 174 Page 386
As Introduced
(4)(a) Except as provided in division (A)(4)(b) of this 11309
section, if more than one plan covers a person as a dependent 11310
child of divorced or separated parents, benefits for the child 11311
are determined in the following order: 11312
(i) The plan of the parent who is the residential 11313
designated parent and legal custodian of the child; 11314
(ii) The plan of the spouse of the parent who is the 11315
residential designated parent and legal custodian of the child; 11316
(iii) The plan of the parent who is not the residential 11317
designated parent and legal custodian of the child. 11318
(b) If the specific terms of a court decree state that one 11319
parent is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, 11320
the plan of that parent is the primary plan. A parent 11321
responsible for the health care pursuant to a court decree must 11322
notify the insurer or health insuring corporation of the terms 11323
of the decree. 11324
(5) The primary plan is the plan that covers a person as 11325
an employee who is neither laid off or retired, or that 11326
employee's dependent. The secondary plan is the plan that covers 11327
that person as a laid-off or retired employee, or that 11328
employee's dependent. 11329
(6) If none of the rules in divisions (A)(1), (2), (3), 11330
(4), and (5) of this section determines the order of benefits, 11331
the primary plan is the plan that covered an employee, member, 11332
insured, or subscriber longer. The secondary plan is the plan 11333
that covered that person the shorter time. 11334
(B) When a plan of health coverage is determined to be a 11335
secondary plan it acts to provide benefits in excess of those 11336
provided by the primary plan. 11337

S. B. No. 174 Page 387
As Introduced
(C) The secondary plan shall not be required to make 11338
payment in an amount which exceeds the amount it would have paid 11339
if it were the primary plan, but in no event, when combined with 11340
the amount paid by the primary plan, shall payments by the 11341
secondary plan exceed one hundred per cent of expenses allowable 11342
under the provisions of the applicable policies and contracts. 11343
(D) A third-party payer may require a beneficiary to file 11344
a claim with the primary plan before it determines the amount of 11345
its payment obligation, if any, with regard to that claim. 11346
(E) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require 11347
a plan to make a payment until it determines whether it is the 11348
primary plan or the secondary plan and what benefits are payable 11349
under the primary plan. 11350
(F) A plan may obtain any facts and information necessary 11351
to apply the provisions of this section, or supply this 11352
information to any other third-party payer or provider, or any 11353
agent of such third-party payer or provider, without the consent 11354
of the beneficiary. Each person claiming benefits under the plan 11355
shall provide any information necessary to apply the provisions 11356
of this section. 11357
(G) If the amount of payments made by any plan is more 11358
than should have been paid, the plan may recover the excess from 11359
whichever party received the excess payment. 11360
(H) No third-party payer shall administer a plan of health 11361
coverage delivered, issued for delivery, or renewed on or after 11362
June 29, 1988, unless such plan complies with this section. 11363
(I)(1) A third-party payer that is subject to this section 11364
and has reason to believe payment has been made by another 11365
third-party payer for the same service may request from that 11366

S. B. No. 174 Page 388
As Introduced
third-party payer, and shall be provided by the third-party 11367
payer, such data as necessary to determine whether duplicate 11368
payment has been made. 11369
(2) A third-party payer that meets the criteria of a 11370
secondary payer in accordance with this section may seek 11371
repayment of any duplicate payment that may have been made from 11372
the person to whom it made payment. If the person who received 11373
the duplicate payment is a provider, absent a finding of a court 11374
of competent jurisdiction that the provider has engaged in civil 11375
or criminal fraudulent activities, the request for the return of 11376
any duplicate payment shall be made within three years after the 11377
close of the provider's fiscal year in which the duplicate 11378
payment has been made. 11379
(J) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect 11380
the prohibition of section 3923.37 of the Revised Code. 11381
(K)(1) No third-party payer shall knowingly fail to comply 11382
with the order of benefits as set forth in division (A) of this 11383
section. 11384
(2) No primary plan shall direct or encourage an insured 11385
to use the benefits of a secondary plan that results in a 11386
reduction of payment by such primary plan. 11387
(L) Whoever violates division (K) of this section is 11388
deemed to have engaged in an unfair and deceptive insurance act 11389
or practice under sections 3901.19 to 3901.26 of the Revised 11390
Code, and is subject to proceedings pursuant to those sections. 11391
Sec. 3924.47. If a child has health care coverage through 11392
