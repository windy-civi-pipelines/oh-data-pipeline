Section 1. That sections 5747.08 and 5747.98 be amended 7
and section 5747.87 of the Revised Code be enacted to read as 8

imposed by section 5747.02 of the Revised Code and each tax 11
imposed under Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code shall be made by 12
every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is 13
liable for the tax imposed by that section or under that 14
chapter, unless the total credits allowed under division (E) of 15
section 5747.05 and divisions (F) and (G) of section 5747.055 of 16

return shall be required unless the taxpayer is liable for a tax 19
imposed pursuant to Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code. 20
(A) If an individual is deceased, any return or notice 21
required of that individual under this chapter shall be made and 22
filed by that decedent's executor, administrator, or other 23
person charged with the property of that decedent. 24
(B) If an individual is unable to make a return or notice 25
required by this chapter, the return or notice required of that 26

authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other 28
person charged with the care of the person or property of that 29
individual. 30
(C) Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust 31
shall be made and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. 32
(D)(1)(a) Except as otherwise provided in division (D)(1) 33
(b) of this section, any pass-through entity may file a single 34
return on behalf of one or more of the entity's investors other 35
than an investor that is a person subject to the tax imposed 36
under section 5733.06 of the Revised Code. The single return 37
shall set forth the name, address, and social security number or 38
other identifying number of each of those pass-through entity 39
investors and shall indicate the distributive share of each of 40
those pass-through entity investor's income taxable in this 41
state in accordance with sections 5747.20 to 5747.231 of the 42
Revised Code. Such pass-through entity investors for whom the 43
pass-through entity elects to file a single return are not 44
entitled to the exemption or credit provided for by sections 45
5747.02 and 5747.022 of the Revised Code; shall calculate the 46

distributive share of the business credits as defined in 50
division (D)(2) of this section. A single check drawn by the 51
pass-through entity shall accompany the return in full payment 52
of the tax due, as shown on the single return, for such 53
investors, other than investors who are persons subject to the 54
tax imposed under section 5733.06 of the Revised Code. 55
(b)(i) A pass-through entity shall not include in such a 56
single return any investor that is a trust to the extent that 57
any direct or indirect current, future, or contingent 58
beneficiary of the trust is a person subject to the tax imposed 59
under section 5733.06 of the Revised Code. 60
(ii) A pass-through entity shall not include in such a 61
single return any investor that is itself a pass-through entity 62
to the extent that any direct or indirect investor in the second 63
pass-through entity is a person subject to the tax imposed under 64
section 5733.06 of the Revised Code. 65
(c) Except as provided by division (L) of this section, 66
nothing in division (D) of this section precludes the tax 67
commissioner from requiring such investors to file the return 68
and make the payment of taxes and related interest, penalty, and 69
interest penalty required by this section or section 5747.02, 70
5747.09, or 5747.15 of the Revised Code. Nothing in division (D) 71
of this section precludes such an investor from filing the 72
annual return under this section, utilizing the refundable 73
credit equal to the investor's proportionate share of the tax 74
paid by the pass-through entity on behalf of the investor under 75
division (I) of this section, and making the payment of taxes 76
imposed under section 5747.02 of the Revised Code. Nothing in 77
division (D) of this section shall be construed to provide to 78

S. B. No. 22 Page 4
As Introduced
such an investor or pass-through entity any additional deduction 79
or credit, other than the credit provided by division (I) of 80
this section, solely on account of the entity's filing a return 81
in accordance with this section. Such a pass-through entity also 82
shall make the filing and payment of estimated taxes on behalf 83
of the pass-through entity investors other than an investor that 84
is a person subject to the tax imposed under section 5733.06 of 85
the Revised Code. 86

means the credits listed in section 5747.98 of the Revised Code 88

As Introduced
(i) The twenty-dollar personal exemption credit under 106
section 5747.022 of the Revised Code; 107
(j) The joint filing credit under division (E) of section 108
5747.05 of the Revised Code; 109
(k) The nonresident credit under division (A) of section 110
5747.05 of the Revised Code; 111
(l) The credit for a resident's out-of-state income under 112
division (B) of section 5747.05 of the Revised Code; 113
(m) The earned income tax credit under section 5747.71 of 114
the Revised Code; 115
(n) The lead abatement credit under section 5747.26 of the 116
Revised Code; 117
(o) The credit for education expenses under section 118

(q) The credit for property taxes or rent-equivalent taxes 122

(3) The election provided for under division (D) of this 124
section applies only to the taxable year for which the election 125
is made by the pass-through entity. Unless the tax commissioner 126
provides otherwise, this election, once made, is binding and 127
irrevocable for the taxable year for which the election is made. 128
Nothing in this division shall be construed to provide for any 129
deduction or credit that would not be allowable if a nonresident 130
pass-through entity investor were to file an annual return. 131
(4) If a pass-through entity makes the election provided 132

S. B. No. 22 Page 6
As Introduced
for under division (D) of this section, the pass-through entity 133
shall be liable for any additional taxes, interest, interest 134
penalty, or penalties imposed by this chapter if the tax 135
commissioner finds that the single return does not reflect the 136
correct tax due by the pass-through entity investors covered by 137
that return. Nothing in this division shall be construed to 138
limit or alter the liability, if any, imposed on pass-through 139
entity investors for unpaid or underpaid taxes, interest, 140
interest penalty, or penalties as a result of the pass-through 141
entity's making the election provided for under division (D) of 142
this section. For the purposes of division (D) of this section, 143
"correct tax due" means the tax that would have been paid by the 144
pass-through entity had the single return been filed in a manner 145
reflecting the commissioner's findings. Nothing in division (D) 146
of this section shall be construed to make or hold a pass- 147
through entity liable for tax attributable to a pass-through 148
entity investor's income from a source other than the pass- 149
through entity electing to file the single return. 150
(E) If a husband and wife file a joint federal income tax 151
return for a taxable year, they shall file a joint return under 152
this section for that taxable year, and their liabilities are 153
joint and several, but, if the federal income tax liability of 154
either spouse is determined on a separate federal income tax 155
return, they shall file separate returns under this section. 156
If either spouse is not required to file a federal income 157
tax return and either or both are required to file a return 158
pursuant to this chapter, they may elect to file separate or 159
joint returns, and, pursuant to that election, their liabilities 160
are separate or joint and several. If a husband and wife file 161
separate returns pursuant to this chapter, each must claim the 162
taxpayer's own exemption, but not both, as authorized under 163

S. B. No. 22 Page 7
As Introduced
section 5747.02 of the Revised Code on the taxpayer's own 164
return. 165
(F) Each return or notice required to be filed under this 166
section shall contain the signature of the taxpayer or the 167
taxpayer's duly authorized agent and of the person who prepared 168
the return for the taxpayer, and shall include the taxpayer's 169
social security number. Each return shall be verified by a 170
declaration under the penalties of perjury. The tax commissioner 171
shall prescribe the form that the signature and declaration 172
shall take. 173
(G) Each return or notice required to be filed under this 174
section shall be made and filed as required by section 5747.04 175
of the Revised Code, on or before the fifteenth day of April of 176
each year, on forms that the tax commissioner shall prescribe, 177
together with remittance made payable to the treasurer of state 178
in the combined amount of the state and all school district 179
income taxes shown to be due on the form. 180
Upon good cause shown, the commissioner may extend the 181
period for filing any notice or return required to be filed 182
under this section and may adopt rules relating to extensions. 183
If the extension results in an extension of time for the payment 184
of any state or school district income tax liability with 185
respect to which the return is filed, the taxpayer shall pay at 186
the time the tax liability is paid an amount of interest 187
computed at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of 188
the Revised Code on that liability from the time that payment is 189
due without extension to the time of actual payment. Except as 190
provided in section 5747.132 of the Revised Code, in addition to 191
all other interest charges and penalties, all taxes imposed 192
under this chapter or Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code and 193

remaining unpaid after they become due, except combined amounts 194
due of one dollar or less, bear interest at the rate per annum 195
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code until paid or 196
until the day an assessment is issued under section 5747.13 of 197
the Revised Code, whichever occurs first. 198
If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to 199
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by section 5747.02 of the 200
Revised Code or any tax imposed under Chapter 5748. of the 201
Revised Code, the commissioner may require returns and payments 202
to be made otherwise than as provided in this section. 203
To the extent that any provision in this division 204
conflicts with any provision in section 5747.026 of the Revised 205
Code, the provision in that section prevails. 206
(H) The amounts withheld pursuant to section 5747.06, 207
5747.062, 5747.063, 5747.064, 5747.065, or 5747.071 of the 208
Revised Code shall be allowed to the ultimate recipient of the 209
income as credits against payment of the appropriate taxes 210
imposed on the ultimate recipient by section 5747.02 and under 211
Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code. As used in this division, 212
"ultimate recipient" means the person who is required to report 213
income from which amounts are withheld pursuant to section 214
5747.06, 5747.062, 5747.063, 5747.064, 5747.065, or 5747.071 of 215
the Revised Code on the annual return required to be filed under 216
this section. 217
(I) If a pass-through entity elects to file a single 218
return under division (D) of this section and if any investor is 219
required to file the annual return and make the payment of taxes 220
required by this chapter on account of the investor's other 221
income that is not included in a single return filed by a pass- 222
through entity or any other investor elects to file the annual 223

S. B. No. 22 Page 9
As Introduced
return, the investor is entitled to a refundable credit equal to 224
the investor's proportionate share of the tax paid by the pass- 225
through entity on behalf of the investor. The investor shall 226
claim the credit for the investor's taxable year in which or 227
with which ends the taxable year of the pass-through entity. 228
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow any credit 229
provided in this chapter to be claimed more than once. For the 230
purpose of computing any interest, penalty, or interest penalty, 231
the investor shall be deemed to have paid the refundable credit 232
provided by this division on the day that the pass-through 233
entity paid the estimated tax or the tax giving rise to the 234
credit. 235
(J) The tax commissioner shall ensure that each return 236
required to be filed under this section includes a box that the 237
taxpayer may check to authorize a paid tax preparer who prepared 238
the return to communicate with the department of taxation about 239
matters pertaining to the return. The return or instructions 240
accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box 241
the taxpayer authorizes the department of taxation to contact 242
the preparer concerning questions that arise during the 243
processing of the return and authorizes the preparer only to 244
provide the department with information that is missing from the 245
return, to contact the department for information about the 246
processing of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund 247
or payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical 248
errors, offsets, or return preparation that the taxpayer has 249
received from the department and has shown to the preparer. 250
(K) The tax commissioner shall permit individual taxpayers 251
to instruct the department of taxation to cause any refund of 252
overpaid taxes to be deposited directly into a checking account, 253
savings account, or an individual retirement account or 254

individual retirement annuity, or preexisting college savings 255
plan or program account offered by the Ohio tuition trust 256
authority under Chapter 3334. of the Revised Code, as designated 257

required by this section electronically. 259
(L) If, for the taxable year, a nonresident or trust that 260
is the owner of an electing pass-through entity, as defined in 261
section 5747.38 of the Revised Code, does not have Ohio adjusted 262
gross income or, in the case of a trust, modified Ohio taxable 263
income other than from one or more electing pass-through 264
entities, the nonresident or trust shall not be required to file 265
an annual return under this section. Nothing in this division 266
precludes such an owner from filing the annual return under this 267
section, utilizing the refundable credit under section 5747.39 268
of the Revised Code equal to the owner's proportionate share of 269
the tax levied under section 5747.38 of the Revised Code and 270
paid by the electing pass-through entity, and making the payment 271
of taxes imposed under section 5747.02 of the Revised Code. 272

annual return under this chapter for the claim year, a credit is 373

Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit or rebate 378
