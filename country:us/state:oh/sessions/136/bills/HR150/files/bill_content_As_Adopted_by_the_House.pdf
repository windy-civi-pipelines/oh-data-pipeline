Honoring Camp Conger on its One Hundredth
Anniversary.
WHEREAS, The members of the House of Representatives of the 136th 1
General Assembly of Ohio are pleased to congratulate Camp Conger as it 2
celebrates its Centennial; and 3
WHEREAS, Recognition of this prestigious milestone is, indeed, a 4
fitting tribute to Camp Conger, for it has attained a remarkable 5
record of accomplishment to the Huron County 4-H program. The camp was 6
established in 1925 on the Conger family farm, and over the years, the 7
site has developed to include such permanent structures as cabins, a 8
general headquarters, a recreation hall, and the Lewis and Florence 9
Conger Hall, which houses the dining hall, kitchen, restrooms, and 10
basement, as well as a lake for a variety of water activities. 11
Providing a space for innumerable young people to experience the 12
wonder and splendor of our natural world through its Cloverbud day, 13
Junior, and Intermediate camps, the site serves approximately three 14
hundred youth each session annually, and it has certainly earned the 15
respect and appreciation of many over the past ten decades; and 16
WHEREAS, Willingly giving of their time, energy, and abilities, 17
the staff and volunteers at Camp Conger have worked tirelessly to 18
create a memorable experience for young people in the 4-H program. 19
Clearly, these conscientious individuals are deserving of high praise 20
for their diligent efforts, and they have set a fine example that is 21
worthy of emulation; and 22
WHEREAS, As the stewards of Camp Conger celebrate this event, they 23
have the unique opportunity to reaffirm their goals and to formulate 24
new policies to meet the challenges of the future. It is through the 25
work of people such as those associated with the camp, who are 26
