portion of the receipts under the tobacco master settlement 2967
agreement so assigned and sold, other than any residual interest 2968
that may be described in the applicable bond proceedings for 2969
those obligations, and that portion, if any, shall be the 2970
property of the issuing authority and not of the state, and 2971
shall be paid directly to the issuing authority, and shall be 2972
owned, received, held, and disbursed by the issuing authority 2973
and not by the state. 2974
The state may covenant, pledge, and agree in the bond 2975
proceedings, with and for the benefit of the issuing authority, 2976
the holders and owners of obligations, and providers of any 2977
credit enhancement facilities, that it shall: (1) maintain 2978
statutory authority for, and cause to be collected and paid 2979

of the pledged tobacco settlement receipts. The bond proceedings 2992
may provide or authorize the manner for determining material 2993
impairment of the security for any outstanding obligations, 2994
including by assessing and evaluating the pledged receipts in 2995
the aggregate. 2996
As further provided for in division (H) of this section, 2997
the bond proceedings may also include such other covenants, 2998
pledges, and agreements by the state to protect and safeguard 2999
the security and rights of the holders and owners of the 3000

foregoing, any covenant, pledge, or agreement customary in 3003
transactions involving the issuance of securities the debt 3004
service on which is payable from or secured by amounts received 3005
under the tobacco master settlement agreement. Notwithstanding 3006
any other provision of law, any covenant, pledge, and agreement 3007
of the state, if and when made in the bond proceedings, shall be 3008
controlling and binding upon, and enforceable against the state 3009
in accordance with its terms for so long as any obligations are 3010
outstanding under the applicable bond proceedings. The bond 3011
proceedings may also include limitations on the remedies 3012
available to the issuing authority, the holders and owners of 3013
the obligations, and the providers of any credit enhancement 3014

determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that the 3018
state has not enforced Chapter 1346. of the Revised Code, the 3019
tobacco master settlement agreement, or the consent decree as 3020

Section 114:
9.98, 9.981, 9.982, and 9.983 of the Revised Code apply to the 3092
obligations. 3093
The purpose of the obligations may be stated in the bond 3094
proceedings in general terms, such as, as applicable, "paying 3095
costs of capital facilities for a system of common schools" and 3096
"paying costs of facilities for state-supported and state- 3097

the school district's respective shares of that basic project 3116
cost; provided that this shall not result in any change in the 3117
state or school district shares of the basic project costs as 3118
determined under that chapter. As used in the preceding 3119
sentence, "Ohio facilities construction commission" and "basic 3120
project costs" have the same meanings as in section 3318.01 of 3121
the Revised Code. 3122
(E) The issuing authority may, without need for any other 3123
approval, appoint or provide for the appointment of paying 3124

the issuing authority to carry out the issuing authority's 3132
functions under this section and section 183.52 of the Revised 3133
Code. The attorney general as counsel to the issuing authority 3134
shall represent the authority in the execution of its powers and 3135
duties, and shall institute and prosecute all actions on its 3136
behalf. The issuing authority, in consultation with the attorney 3137
general, shall select counsel, and the attorney general shall 3138
appoint the counsel selected, for the purposes of carrying out 3139
the functions under this section and related sections of the 3140
Revised Code. Financing costs are payable, as may be provided in 3141

receipts. 3145
(F) The issuing authority may irrevocably pledge and 3146
assign all, or such portion as the issuing authority determines, 3147
of the pledged receipts to the payment of the debt service 3148
charges on obligations issued under this section, and for the 3149
establishment and maintenance of any reserves, as provided in 3150
the bond proceedings, and make other provisions in the bond 3151
proceedings with respect to pledged receipts as authorized by 3152
this section, which provisions are controlling notwithstanding 3153
any other provisions of law pertaining to them. Any and all 3154
pledged receipts received by the issuing authority and required 3155
by the bond proceedings, consistent with this section, to be 3156
deposited, transferred, or credited to the bond service fund, 3157
and all other money transferred or allocated to or received for 3158
the purposes of that fund, shall be deposited and credited to 3159
the bond service fund created in the bond proceedings for the 3160
obligations, subject to any applicable provisions of those bond 3161
proceedings, but without necessity for any act of appropriation. 3162
Those pledged receipts shall immediately be subject to the lien 3163
of that pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further 3164
act, and shall not be subject to other court judgments. The lien 3165
of the pledge of those pledged receipts shall be valid and 3166
binding against all parties having claims of any kind against 3167
the issuing authority, irrespective of whether those parties 3168
have notice thereof. The pledge shall create a perfected 3169
security interest for all purposes of Chapter 1309. of the 3170
Revised Code and a perfected lien for purposes of any other 3171
interest, all without the necessity for separation or delivery 3172
of funds or for the filing or recording of the applicable bond 3173
proceedings by which that pledge is created or any certificate, 3174
statement, or other document with respect thereto. The pledge of 3175

the pledged receipts shall be effective and the money therefrom 3176
and thereof may be applied to the purposes for which pledged. 3177

the issuing authority, by an indenture or a trust agreement 3179
between the issuing authority and a corporate trustee, which may 3180
be any trust company or bank having a place of business within 3181
the state. Any indenture or trust agreement may contain the 3182
resolution or order authorizing the issuance of the obligations, 3183
any provisions that may be contained in any bond proceedings, 3184
and other provisions that are customary or appropriate in an 3185
agreement of that type, including, but not limited to: 3186

obligations and of the trustee and provisions for protecting and 3197
enforcing them, including limitations on rights of individual 3198

customary or appropriate to the financing or to the obligations 3201
or to particular obligations including, but not limited to, 3202

funds or other funds under the bond proceedings may furnish 3216
indemnifying bonds or pledge securities as required by the 3217
issuing authority. 3218

of the expenses of the enforcement activity of the attorney 3254
general referred to in division (B) of this section from the 3255
amounts from the tobacco master settlement agreement assigned 3256
and sold to the issuing authority under that division or from 3257
the proceeds of obligations, or a combination thereof, which may 3258

not file a voluntary petition under the United States Bankruptcy 3263

any similar bankruptcy proceeding under state law including, 3265
without limitation, consenting to the appointment of a receiver 3266
or trustee or making a general or specific assignment for the 3267
benefit of creditors, and neither any public officer or any 3268
organization, entity, or other person shall authorize the 3269
issuing authority to be or become a debtor under the United 3270
States Bankruptcy Code or take any of those actions under the 3271
United States Bankruptcy Code or state law. The state hereby 3272
covenants, and the issuing authority shall covenant, with the 3273
holders or owners of the obligations, that the state shall not 3274
permit the issuing authority to file a voluntary petition under 3275
the United States Bankruptcy Code or take any of those actions 3276
under the United States Bankruptcy Code or state law during the 3277
period obligations are outstanding and for any additional period 3278
for which the issuing authority covenants in the bond 3279
proceedings, which additional period may, but need not, be a 3280
period of three hundred sixty-seven days or more. 3281
(I) The obligations requiring execution by or for the 3282
issuing authority shall be signed as provided in the bond 3283
proceedings, and may bear the official seal of the issuing 3284
authority or a facsimile thereof. Any obligation may be signed 3285
by the individual who, on the date of execution, is the 3286
authorized signer even though, on the date of the obligations, 3287
that individual is not an authorized signer. In case the 3288
individual whose signature or facsimile signature appears on any 3289
obligation ceases to be an authorized signer before delivery of 3290
the obligation, that signature or facsimile is nevertheless 3291
valid and sufficient for all purposes as if that individual had 3292
remained the authorized signer until delivery. 3293

uncertificated form, as the issuing authority determines. 3298
Provision may be made for the exchange, conversion, or transfer 3299
of obligations and for reasonable charges for registration, 3300
exchange, conversion, and transfer. Pending preparation of final 3301
obligations, the issuing authority may provide for the issuance 3302
of interim instruments to be exchanged for the final 3303
obligations. 3304
(K) Obligations may be sold at public sale or at private 3305
sale, in such manner, and at such price at, above, or below par, 3306
all as determined by and provided by the issuing authority in 3307
the bond proceedings. 3308
(L) Except to the extent that rights are restricted by the 3309

counterparty to a credit enhancement facility may by any 3311
suitable form of legal proceedings protect and enforce any 3312
rights relating to obligations or that facility under the laws 3313
of this state or granted by the bond proceedings. Those rights 3314
include the right to compel the performance of all applicable 3315
duties of the issuing authority and the state. Each duty of the 3316
issuing authority and that issuing authority's officers, staff, 3317
and employees, and of each state entity or agency, or using 3318
district or using institution, and its officers, members, staff, 3319
or employees, undertaken pursuant to the bond proceedings, is 3320
hereby established as a duty of the entity or individual having 3321
authority to perform that duty, specifically enjoined by law and 3322
resulting from an office, trust, or station within the meaning 3323
of section 2731.01 of the Revised Code. The individuals who are 3324

designees acting pursuant to section 183.52 of the Revised Code, 3326
or the issuing authority's officers, staff, agents, or 3327
employees, when acting within the scope of their employment or 3328
agency, shall not be liable in their personal capacities on any 3329

otherwise exercising or carrying out any purposes or powers of 3331
the issuing authority. 3332

and provide for the issuance of: 3335
(a) Obligations in the form of bond anticipation notes, 3336
and may authorize and provide for the renewal of those notes 3337
from time to time by the issuance of new notes. The holders of 3338
notes or appertaining interest coupons have the right to have 3339
debt service on those notes paid solely from the moneys and 3340
special funds, and all or any portion of the pledged receipts, 3341
that are or may be pledged to that payment, including the 3342
proceeds of bonds or renewal notes or both, as the issuing 3343
authority provides in the bond proceedings authorizing the 3344
notes. Notes may be additionally secured by covenants of the 3345
issuing authority to the effect that the issuing authority will 3346
do all things necessary for the issuance of bonds or renewal 3347
notes in such principal amount and upon such terms as may be 3348
necessary to provide moneys to pay when due the debt service on 3349
the notes, and apply their proceeds to the extent necessary, to 3350
make full and timely payment of debt service on the notes as 3351
provided in the applicable bond proceedings. In the bond 3352
proceedings authorizing the issuance of bond anticipation notes 3353

service on the bonds, amounts sufficient to pay the principal of 3360
the bonds anticipated as set forth in that estimated schedule 3361
during the time the notes are outstanding, which amounts shall 3362
be used solely to pay the principal of those notes or of the 3363
bonds anticipated. 3364

retirement, and advance refunding, with or without payment or 3366

state, shall institute such action in the court of common pleas 6185
of Franklin county or any other county the superintendent or 6186

domestic insurance company franchise taxes in the office of the 6190
treasurer of state and have been unpaid for a period of forty- 6191

notify each such company of any amount due, which amount shall 6220
be paid by each such company to the treasurer of state by the 6221

been made and mailed to it, or if the annual statement required 6233
by law to be made by it is false or incorrect, the 6234
superintendent of insurance may revoke the license of such 6235

pay into the county treasury a license fee in the sum of fifty 6282
dollars for each fixed place of business in the county that will 6283
be the situs of retail sales. Upon receipt of the application 6284
and exhibition of the county treasurer's receipt, showing the 6285
payment of the license fee, the county auditor shall issue to 6286
the applicant a license for each fixed place of business 6287
designated in the application, authorizing the applicant to 6288

transmit remit twenty-five dollars of each license fee to the 6290
treasurer of state attorney general for deposit into the state 6291
treasury to the credit of the organized crime commission fund 6292
for the purposes specified in section 177.011 of the Revised 6293
Code. The remaining twenty-five dollars of each license fee 6294
shall be credited to the general fund of the county. 6295
(B) If a vendor's identity changes, the vendor shall apply 6296
for a new license. If a vendor wishes to move an existing fixed 6297
place of business to a new location within the same county, the 6298
vendor shall obtain a new vendor's license or submit a request 6299
to the commissioner to transfer the existing vendor's license to 6300
the new location. When the new location has been verified as 6301
being within the same county, the commissioner shall authorize 6302
the transfer and notify the county auditor of the change of 6303
location. If a vendor wishes to move an existing fixed place of 6304
business to another county, the vendor's license shall not 6305
transfer and the vendor shall obtain a new vendor's license from 6306
the county in which the business is to be located. The form of 6307
the license shall be prescribed by the commissioner. The fees 6308
collected shall be credited as specified in division (A)(3) of 6309
this section. If a vendor fails to notify the commissioner of a 6310
change of location of its fixed place of business or that its 6311
business has closed, the commissioner may cancel the vendor's 6312
license if ordinary mail sent to the location shown on the 6313
license is returned because of an undeliverable address. 6314
(C) The commissioner may establish or participate in a 6315
registration system whereby any vendor may obtain a vendor's 6316
license by submitting to the commissioner a vendor's license 6317
application and a license fee of fifty dollars for each fixed 6318
place of business at which the vendor intends to make retail 6319

sales. Under this registration system, the commissioner shall 6320
issue a vendor's license to the applicant on behalf of the 6321
county auditor of the county in which the applicant desires to 6322
engage in business, and shall forward a copy of the application 6323
and license fee to that county. Twenty-five dollars of each 6324
license fee received by the commissioner for the issuance of 6325
vendor's licenses shall be deposited into the vendor's license 6326
application fund, which is hereby created in the state treasury. 6327
The remaining twenty-five dollars of each license fee shall be 6328
deposited into the organized crime commission fund for the 6329
purposes specified in section 177.011 of the Revised Code. The 6330
commissioner shall certify to the director of budget and 6331
management within ten business days after the close of a month 6332
the license fees to be transmitted to each county from the 6333
vendor's license application fund for vendor's license 6334
applications received by the commissioner during that month. 6335
License fees transmitted to a county for which payment was not 6336
received by the commissioner may be netted against a future 6337
distribution to that county, including distributions made 6338
pursuant to section 5739.21 of the Revised Code. 6339
A vendor that makes retail sales subject to tax under 6340
Chapter 5739. of the Revised Code pursuant to a permit issued by 6341
the division of liquor control shall obtain a vendor's license 6342
in the identical name and for the identical address as shown on 6343
the permit. 6344
Except as otherwise provided in this section, if a vendor 6345
has no fixed place of business and sells from a vehicle, each 6346
vehicle intended to be used within a county constitutes a place 6347
of business for the purpose of this section. 6348
(D) As used in this section, "transient vendor" means any 6349
S. B. No. 300 Page 214

person who makes sales of tangible personal property from 6350
vending machines located on land owned by others, who leases 6351
titled motor vehicles, titled watercraft, or titled outboard 6352
motors, who effectuates leases that are taxed according to 6353
division (A)(2) of section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, or who, 6354
in the usual course of the person's business, transports 6355
inventory, stock of goods, or similar tangible personal property 6356
to a temporary place of business or temporary exhibition, show, 6357
fair, flea market, or similar event in a county in which the 6358
person has no fixed place of business, for the purpose of making 6359
retail sales of such property. A "temporary place of business" 6360
means any public or quasi-public place including, but not 6361
limited to, a hotel, rooming house, storeroom, building, part of 6362
a building, tent, vacant lot, railroad car, or motor vehicle 6363
that is temporarily occupied for the purpose of making retail 6364
sales of goods to the public. A place of business is not 6365
temporary if the same person conducted business at the place 6366
continuously for more than six months or occupied the premises 6367
as the person's permanent residence for more than six months, or 6368
if the person intends it to be a fixed place of business. 6369
Any transient vendor, in lieu of obtaining a vendor's 6370
license under division (A) of this section for counties in which 6371
the transient vendor has no fixed place of business, may apply 6372
to the tax commissioner, on a form prescribed by the 6373
commissioner, for a transient vendor's license. The transient 6374
vendor's license authorizes the transient vendor to make retail 6375
sales in any county in which the transient vendor does not 6376
maintain a fixed place of business. Any holder of a transient 6377
vendor's license shall not be required to obtain a separate 6378
vendor's license from the county auditor in that county. Upon 6379
the commissioner's determination that an applicant is a 6380
S. B. No. 300 Page 215
As Introduced
transient vendor, the applicant shall pay a license fee in the 6381
amount of fifty dollars, at which time the tax commissioner 6382
shall issue the license. Twenty-five dollars of that license fee 6383
shall be deposited into the organized crime commission fund for 6384
the purposes specified in section 177.011 of the Revised Code. 6385
The tax commissioner may require a vendor to be licensed as a 6386
transient vendor if, in the opinion of the commissioner, such 6387
licensing is necessary for the efficient administration of the 6388
tax. 6389
Any holder of a valid transient vendor's license may make 6390
retail sales at a temporary place of business or temporary 6391
exhibition, show, fair, flea market, or similar event, held 6392
anywhere in the state without complying with any provision of 6393

Section 221:
section 311.37 of the Revised Code. Any holder of a valid 6394
vendor's license may make retail sales as a transient vendor at 6395
a temporary place of business or temporary exhibition, show, 6396
fair, flea market, or similar event held in any county in which 6397
the vendor maintains a fixed place of business for which the 6398
vendor holds a vendor's license without obtaining a transient 6399
vendor's license. 6400
(E) Any vendor who is issued a license pursuant to this 6401

Section 222:
section shall display the license or a copy of it prominently, 6402
in plain view, at every place of business of the vendor. 6403
(F) No owner, organizer, or promoter who operates a fair, 6404
flea market, show, exhibition, convention, or similar event at 6405
which transient vendors are present shall fail to keep a 6406
comprehensive record of all such vendors, listing the vendor's 6407
name, permanent address, vendor's license number, and the type 6408
of goods sold. Such records shall be kept for four years and 6409
shall be open to inspection by the commissioner. 6410

Sec. 5747.51. (A) On or before the twenty-fifth day of 6414
July of each year, the tax commissioner shall make and certify 6415
to the county auditor of each county an estimate of the amount 6416
of the local government fund to be allocated to the undivided 6417
local government fund of each county for the ensuing calendar 6418
year, adjusting the total as required to account for 6419
subdivisions receiving local government funds under section 6420

Section 223:

(B) At each annual regular session of the county budget 6422
commission convened pursuant to section 5705.27 of the Revised 6423
Code, each auditor shall present to the commission the 6424
certificate of the commissioner, the annual tax budget and 6425
estimates, and the records showing the action of the commission 6426
in its last preceding regular session. The commission, after 6427
extending to the representatives of each subdivision an 6428
opportunity to be heard, under oath administered by any member 6429
of the commission, and considering all the facts and information 6430
presented to it by the auditor, shall determine the amount of 6431
the undivided local government fund needed by and to be 6432
apportioned to each subdivision for current operating expenses, 6433
as shown in the tax budget of the subdivision. This 6434
determination shall be made pursuant to divisions (C) to (I) of 6435
this section, unless the commission has provided for a formula 6436
pursuant to section 5747.53 of the Revised Code. The 6437
commissioner shall reduce the amount of funds from the undivided 6438
local government fund to a subdivision required to receive 6439
reduced funds under section 5747.502 of the Revised Code. 6440

Nothing in this section prevents the budget commission, 6441
for the purpose of apportioning the undivided local government 6442
fund, from inquiring into the claimed needs of any subdivision 6443
as stated in its tax budget, or from adjusting claimed needs to 6444
reflect actual needs. For the purposes of this section, "current 6445
operating expenses" means the lawful expenditures of a 6446
subdivision, except those for permanent improvements and except 6447
payments for interest, sinking fund, and retirement of bonds, 6448
notes, and certificates of indebtedness of the subdivision. 6449
(C) The commission shall determine the combined total of 6450
the estimated expenditures, including transfers, from the 6451
general fund and any special funds other than special funds 6452
established for road and bridge; street construction, 6453
maintenance, and repair; state highway improvement; and gas, 6454
water, sewer, and electric public utilities operated by a 6455
subdivision, as shown in the subdivision's tax budget for the 6456
ensuing calendar year. 6457

pursuant to division (C) of this section, the commission shall 6459
deduct the following expenditures, if included in these funds in 6460
the tax budget: 6461
(1) Expenditures for permanent improvements as defined in 6462
division (E) of section 5705.01 of the Revised Code; 6463

the levy of an income tax, an income tax levied by the 6494
legislative authority of such municipal corporation pursuant to 6495
an amendment of the charter of that municipal corporation to 6496
authorize such a levy represents an additional tax voted by the 6497

treasurer classifies public moneys as interim moneys, the 1145
treasurer shall notify the governing board of such action. The 1146
notification shall be given within thirty days after such 1147

the obligations, and the providers of any credit enhancement 3014
facilities, including, without limiting the generality of the 3015
foregoing, a provision that those remedies may be limited to 3016
injunctive relief in circumstances where there has been no prior 3017
determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that the 3018
state has not enforced Chapter 1346. of the Revised Code, the 3019
tobacco master settlement agreement, or the consent decree as 3020
may have been covenanted or agreed in the bond proceedings under 3021

division (B)(5) of this section. 3022
Nothing in this section or the bond proceedings shall 3023
preclude or limit, or be construed to preclude or limit, the 3024
state from regulating or authorizing or permitting the 3025
regulation of smoking or from taxing and regulating the sale of 3026
cigarettes or other tobacco products, or from defending or 3027
prosecuting cases or other actions relating to the sale or use 3028
of cigarettes or other tobacco products. Except as otherwise may 3029
be agreed in writing by the attorney general, nothing in this 3030
section or the bond proceedings shall modify or limit, or be 3031
construed to modify or limit, the responsibility, power, 3032
judgment, and discretion of the attorney general to protect and 3033
discharge the duties, rights, and obligations of the state under 3034
the tobacco master settlement agreement, the consent decree, or 3035
Chapter 1346. of the Revised Code. 3036
The governor and the director of budget and management, in 3037
consultation with the attorney general, on behalf of the state, 3038
and any member or officer of the issuing authority as authorized 3039
by that issuing authority, on behalf of the issuing authority, 3040
may take any action and execute any documents, including any 3041
purchase and sale agreements, necessary to effect the assignment 3042
and sale and the acceptance of the assignment and title to the 3043
receipts including, providing irrevocable direction to the 3044
escrow agent acting under the tobacco master settlement 3045
agreement to transfer directly to the issuing authority the 3046
amounts to be received under that agreement that are subject to 3047
such assignment and sale. Any purchase and sale agreement or 3048
other bond proceedings may contain the terms and conditions 3049
established by the state and the issuing authority to carry out 3050
and effectuate the purposes of this section, including, without 3051
limitation, covenants binding the state in favor of the issuing 3052

authority and its assignees and the owners of the obligations. 3053
Any such purchase and sale agreement shall be sufficient to 3054
effectuate such purchase and sale without regard to any other 3055
laws governing other property sales or financial transactions by 3056
the state. 3057
Not later than two years following the date on which there 3058
are no longer any obligations outstanding under the bond 3059
proceedings, all assets of the issuing authority shall vest in 3060
the state, the issuing authority shall execute any necessary 3061
assignments or instruments, including any assignment of any 3062
right, title, or ownership to the state for receipt of amounts 3063
under the tobacco master settlement agreement, and the issuing 3064
authority shall be dissolved. 3065
(C) The issuing authority is authorized to issue and to 3066
sell obligations as provided in this section. The aggregate 3067
principal amount of obligations issued under this section shall 3068
not exceed six billion dollars, exclusive of obligations issued 3069
under division (M)(1) of this section to refund, renew, or 3070
advance refund other obligations issued or incurred. At least 3071
seventy-five per cent of the aggregate net proceeds of the 3072
obligations issued under the authority of this section, 3073
exclusive of obligations issued to refund, renew, or advance 3074
refund other obligations, shall be paid to the state for deposit 3075
into the school building program assistance fund created in 3076
section 3318.25 of the Revised Code. 3077
(D) Each issue of obligations shall be authorized by 3078
resolution or order of the issuing authority. The bond 3079
proceedings shall provide for or authorize the manner for 3080
determining the principal amount or maximum principal amount of 3081
obligations of an issue, the principal maturity or maturities, 3082

S. B. No. 300 Page 105
As Introduced
the interest rate or rates, the date of and the dates of payment 3083
of interest on the obligations, their denominations, and the 3084
place or places of payment of debt service which may be within 3085
or outside the state. Unless otherwise provided by law, the 3086
latest principal maturity may not be later than the earlier of 3087
the thirty-first day of December of the fiftieth calendar year 3088
after the year of issuance of the particular obligations or of 3089
the fiftieth calendar year after the year in which the original 3090
obligation to pay was issued or entered into. Sections 9.96, 3091
9.98, 9.981, 9.982, and 9.983 of the Revised Code apply to the 3092
obligations. 3093
The purpose of the obligations may be stated in the bond 3094
proceedings in general terms, such as, as applicable, "paying 3095
costs of capital facilities for a system of common schools" and 3096
"paying costs of facilities for state-supported and state- 3097
assisted institutions of higher education." Unless otherwise 3098
provided in the bond proceedings or in division (C) of this 3099
section, the net proceeds from the issuance of the obligations 3100
shall be paid to the state for deposit into the applicable 3101
improvement fund. In addition to the investments authorized in 3102
Chapter 135. of the Revised Code, the net proceeds held in an 3103
improvement fund may be invested by the treasurer of state in 3104
guaranteed investment contracts with providers rated at the time 3105
of any investment in the three highest rating categories by two 3106
nationally recognized rating agencies, all subject to the terms 3107
and conditions set forth in those agreements or the bond 3108
proceedings. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Chapter 3109
3318. of the Revised Code, net proceeds of obligations deposited 3110
into the school building program assistance fund created in 3111
section 3318.25 of the Revised Code may be used to pay basic 3112
project costs under that chapter at the times determined by the 3113

Ohio facilities construction commission without regard to 3114
whether those expenditures are in proportion to the state's and 3115
the school district's respective shares of that basic project 3116
cost; provided that this shall not result in any change in the 3117
state or school district shares of the basic project costs as 3118
determined under that chapter. As used in the preceding 3119
sentence, "Ohio facilities construction commission" and "basic 3120
project costs" have the same meanings as in section 3318.01 of 3121
the Revised Code. 3122
(E) The issuing authority may, without need for any other 3123
approval, appoint or provide for the appointment of paying 3124
agents, bond registrars, securities depositories, credit 3125
enhancement providers or counterparties, clearing corporations, 3126
and transfer agents, and retain or contract for the services of 3127
underwriters, investment bankers, financial advisers, accounting 3128
experts, marketing, remarketing, indexing, and administrative 3129
agents, other consultants, and independent contractors, 3130
including printing services, as are necessary in the judgment of 3131
the issuing authority to carry out the issuing authority's 3132
functions under this section and section 183.52 of the Revised 3133
Code. The attorney general as counsel to the issuing authority 3134
shall represent the authority in the execution of its powers and 3135
duties, and shall institute and prosecute all actions on its 3136
behalf. The issuing authority, in consultation with the attorney 3137
general, shall select counsel, and the attorney general shall 3138
appoint the counsel selected, for the purposes of carrying out 3139
the functions under this section and related sections of the 3140
Revised Code. Financing costs are payable, as may be provided in 3141
the bond proceedings, from the proceeds of the obligations, from 3142
special funds, or from other moneys available for the purpose, 3143
including as to future financing costs, from the pledged 3144

receipts. 3145
(F) The issuing authority may irrevocably pledge and 3146
assign all, or such portion as the issuing authority determines, 3147
of the pledged receipts to the payment of the debt service 3148
charges on obligations issued under this section, and for the 3149
establishment and maintenance of any reserves, as provided in 3150
the bond proceedings, and make other provisions in the bond 3151
proceedings with respect to pledged receipts as authorized by 3152
this section, which provisions are controlling notwithstanding 3153
any other provisions of law pertaining to them. Any and all 3154
pledged receipts received by the issuing authority and required 3155
by the bond proceedings, consistent with this section, to be 3156
deposited, transferred, or credited to the bond service fund, 3157
and all other money transferred or allocated to or received for 3158
the purposes of that fund, shall be deposited and credited to 3159
the bond service fund created in the bond proceedings for the 3160
obligations, subject to any applicable provisions of those bond 3161
proceedings, but without necessity for any act of appropriation. 3162
Those pledged receipts shall immediately be subject to the lien 3163
of that pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further 3164
act, and shall not be subject to other court judgments. The lien 3165
of the pledge of those pledged receipts shall be valid and 3166
binding against all parties having claims of any kind against 3167
the issuing authority, irrespective of whether those parties 3168
have notice thereof. The pledge shall create a perfected 3169
security interest for all purposes of Chapter 1309. of the 3170
Revised Code and a perfected lien for purposes of any other 3171
interest, all without the necessity for separation or delivery 3172
of funds or for the filing or recording of the applicable bond 3173
proceedings by which that pledge is created or any certificate, 3174
statement, or other document with respect thereto. The pledge of 3175

S. B. No. 300 Page 108
As Introduced
the pledged receipts shall be effective and the money therefrom 3176
and thereof may be applied to the purposes for which pledged. 3177
(G) Obligations may be further secured, as determined by 3178
the issuing authority, by an indenture or a trust agreement 3179
between the issuing authority and a corporate trustee, which may 3180
be any trust company or bank having a place of business within 3181
the state. Any indenture or trust agreement may contain the 3182
resolution or order authorizing the issuance of the obligations, 3183
any provisions that may be contained in any bond proceedings, 3184
and other provisions that are customary or appropriate in an 3185
agreement of that type, including, but not limited to: 3186
(1) Maintenance of each pledge, indenture, trust 3187

secured by it; 3191
(2) In the event of default in any payments required to be 3192
made by the bond proceedings, enforcement of those payments or 3193

(3) The rights and remedies of the holders or owners of 3196
obligations and of the trustee and provisions for protecting and 3197
enforcing them, including limitations on rights of individual 3198
holders and owners. 3199
(H) The bond proceedings may contain additional provisions 3200
customary or appropriate to the financing or to the obligations 3201
or to particular obligations including, but not limited to, 3202
provisions for: 3203
(1) The redemption of obligations prior to maturity at the 3204

of Chapter 131. or 135. of the Revised Code, but subject to any 3212
special provisions of this section with respect to the 3213
application of particular funds or moneys. Any financial 3214
institution that acts as a depository of any moneys in special 3215
funds or other funds under the bond proceedings may furnish 3216
indemnifying bonds or pledge securities as required by the 3217
issuing authority. 3218
(4) Any or every provision of the bond proceedings being 3219
binding upon the issuing authority and upon such governmental 3220
agency or entity, officer, board, authority, agency, department, 3221
institution, district, or other person or body as may from time 3222
to time be authorized to take actions as may be necessary to 3223
perform all or any part of the duty required by the provision; 3224
(5) The maintenance of each pledge or instrument 3225
comprising part of the bond proceedings until the issuing 3226
authority has fully paid or provided for the payment of the debt 3227
service on the obligations or met other stated conditions; 3228
(6) In the event of default in any payments required to be 3229

including limitations on rights of individual holders or owners; 3240

determines, including limitations, conditions, or 3250
qualifications, relating to any of the foregoing or the 3251
activities of the issuing authority in connection therewith. 3252
The bond proceedings shall make provision for the payment 3253
of the expenses of the enforcement activity of the attorney 3254
general referred to in division (B) of this section from the 3255
amounts from the tobacco master settlement agreement assigned 3256
and sold to the issuing authority under that division or from 3257
the proceeds of obligations, or a combination thereof, which may 3258
include provision for both annual payments and a special fund 3259
providing reserve amounts for the payment of those expenses. 3260
The issuing authority shall not, and shall covenant in the 3261
bond proceedings that it shall not, be authorized to and shall 3262

S. B. No. 300 Page 111
As Introduced
not file a voluntary petition under the United States Bankruptcy 3263
Code, 11 U.S.C. 101 et seq., as amended, or voluntarily commence 3264
any similar bankruptcy proceeding under state law including, 3265
without limitation, consenting to the appointment of a receiver 3266
or trustee or making a general or specific assignment for the 3267
benefit of creditors, and neither any public officer or any 3268
organization, entity, or other person shall authorize the 3269
issuing authority to be or become a debtor under the United 3270
States Bankruptcy Code or take any of those actions under the 3271
United States Bankruptcy Code or state law. The state hereby 3272
covenants, and the issuing authority shall covenant, with the 3273
holders or owners of the obligations, that the state shall not 3274
permit the issuing authority to file a voluntary petition under 3275
the United States Bankruptcy Code or take any of those actions 3276
under the United States Bankruptcy Code or state law during the 3277
period obligations are outstanding and for any additional period 3278
for which the issuing authority covenants in the bond 3279
proceedings, which additional period may, but need not, be a 3280
period of three hundred sixty-seven days or more. 3281
(I) The obligations requiring execution by or for the 3282
issuing authority shall be signed as provided in the bond 3283
proceedings, and may bear the official seal of the issuing 3284
authority or a facsimile thereof. Any obligation may be signed 3285
by the individual who, on the date of execution, is the 3286
authorized signer even though, on the date of the obligations, 3287
that individual is not an authorized signer. In case the 3288
individual whose signature or facsimile signature appears on any 3289
obligation ceases to be an authorized signer before delivery of 3290
the obligation, that signature or facsimile is nevertheless 3291
valid and sufficient for all purposes as if that individual had 3292
remained the authorized signer until delivery. 3293

(J) Obligations are investment securities under Chapter 3294
1308. of the Revised Code. Obligations may be issued in bearer 3295
or in registered form, registrable as to principal alone or as 3296

uncertificated form, as the issuing authority determines. 3298
Provision may be made for the exchange, conversion, or transfer 3299
of obligations and for reasonable charges for registration, 3300
exchange, conversion, and transfer. Pending preparation of final 3301
obligations, the issuing authority may provide for the issuance 3302
of interim instruments to be exchanged for the final 3303
obligations. 3304
(K) Obligations may be sold at public sale or at private 3305
sale, in such manner, and at such price at, above, or below par, 3306
all as determined by and provided by the issuing authority in 3307
the bond proceedings. 3308
(L) Except to the extent that rights are restricted by the 3309
bond proceedings, any owner of obligations or provider of or 3310
counterparty to a credit enhancement facility may by any 3311
suitable form of legal proceedings protect and enforce any 3312
rights relating to obligations or that facility under the laws 3313
of this state or granted by the bond proceedings. Those rights 3314
include the right to compel the performance of all applicable 3315
duties of the issuing authority and the state. Each duty of the 3316
issuing authority and that issuing authority's officers, staff, 3317
and employees, and of each state entity or agency, or using 3318
district or using institution, and its officers, members, staff, 3319
or employees, undertaken pursuant to the bond proceedings, is 3320
hereby established as a duty of the entity or individual having 3321
authority to perform that duty, specifically enjoined by law and 3322
resulting from an office, trust, or station within the meaning 3323
of section 2731.01 of the Revised Code. The individuals who are 3324

from time to time members of the issuing authority, or their 3325
designees acting pursuant to section 183.52 of the Revised Code, 3326
or the issuing authority's officers, staff, agents, or 3327
employees, when acting within the scope of their employment or 3328
agency, shall not be liable in their personal capacities on any 3329
obligations or otherwise under the bond proceedings, or for 3330
otherwise exercising or carrying out any purposes or powers of 3331
the issuing authority. 3332
(M)(1) Subject to any applicable limitations in division 3333
(C) of this section, the issuing authority may also authorize 3334
and provide for the issuance of: 3335
(a) Obligations in the form of bond anticipation notes, 3336
and may authorize and provide for the renewal of those notes 3337
from time to time by the issuance of new notes. The holders of 3338
notes or appertaining interest coupons have the right to have 3339
debt service on those notes paid solely from the moneys and 3340
special funds, and all or any portion of the pledged receipts, 3341
that are or may be pledged to that payment, including the 3342
proceeds of bonds or renewal notes or both, as the issuing 3343
authority provides in the bond proceedings authorizing the 3344
notes. Notes may be additionally secured by covenants of the 3345
issuing authority to the effect that the issuing authority will 3346
do all things necessary for the issuance of bonds or renewal 3347
notes in such principal amount and upon such terms as may be 3348
necessary to provide moneys to pay when due the debt service on 3349
the notes, and apply their proceeds to the extent necessary, to 3350
make full and timely payment of debt service on the notes as 3351
provided in the applicable bond proceedings. In the bond 3352
proceedings authorizing the issuance of bond anticipation notes 3353
the issuing authority shall set forth for the bonds anticipated 3354
an estimated schedule of annual principal payments the latest of 3355

S. B. No. 300 Page 114

deposited, as shall be provided in the bond proceedings for 3358
those notes, from the sources authorized for payment of debt 3359
service on the bonds, amounts sufficient to pay the principal of 3360
the bonds anticipated as set forth in that estimated schedule 3361
during the time the notes are outstanding, which amounts shall 3362
be used solely to pay the principal of those notes or of the 3363
bonds anticipated. 3364
(b) Obligations for the refunding, including funding and 3365
retirement, and advance refunding, with or without payment or 3366
redemption prior to maturity, of any obligations previously 3367
issued under this section and any bonds or notes previously 3368
issued for the purpose of paying costs of capital facilities 3369
for: (i) state-supported or state-assisted institutions of 3370
higher education as authorized by sections 151.01 and 151.04 of 3371
the Revised Code, pursuant to Sections 2i and 2n of Article 3372

of state government limited to facilities for a system of common 3374
schools throughout the state as authorized by sections 151.01 3375
and 151.03 of the Revised Code, pursuant to Sections 2i and 2n 3376
of Article VIII, Ohio Constitution. Refunding obligations may be 3377
issued in amounts sufficient to pay or to provide for repayment 3378
of the principal amount, including principal amounts maturing 3379
prior to the redemption of the remaining prior obligations or 3380
bonds or notes, any redemption premium, and interest accrued or 3381
to accrue to the maturity or redemption date or dates, payable 3382
on the prior obligations or bonds or notes, and related 3383
financing costs and any expenses incurred or to be incurred in 3384
connection with that issuance and refunding. Subject to the 3385
applicable bond proceedings, the portion of the proceeds of the 3386

sale of refunding obligations issued under division (M)(1)(b) of 3387
this section to be applied to debt service on the prior 3388
obligations or bonds or notes shall be credited to an 3389
appropriate separate account in the bond service fund and held 3390
in trust for the purpose by the issuing authority or by a 3391
corporate trustee, and may be invested as provided in the bond 3392
proceedings. Obligations authorized under this division shall be 3393
considered to be issued for those purposes for which the prior 3394
obligations or bonds or notes were issued. 3395
(2) The principal amount of refunding, advance refunding, 3396
or renewal obligations issued pursuant to division (M) of this 3397
section shall be in addition to the amount authorized in 3398
division (C) of this section. 3399

and loan associations, credit union share guaranty corporations, 3401
trust companies, trustees, fiduciaries, insurance companies, 3402
including domestic for life and domestic not for life, trustees 3403
or other officers having charge of sinking and bond retirement 3404
or other special funds of the state and political subdivisions 3405
and taxing districts of this state, notwithstanding any other 3406
provisions of the Revised Code or rules adopted pursuant to 3407
those provisions by any state agency with respect to investments 3408
by them, and are also acceptable as security for the repayment 3409
of the deposit of public moneys. The exemptions from taxation in 3410
Ohio as provided for in particular sections of the Ohio 3411
Constitution and section 5709.76 of the Revised Code apply to 3412
the obligations. 3413
(O)(1) Unless otherwise provided or provided for in any 3414
applicable bond proceedings, moneys to the credit of or in a 3415
special fund shall be disbursed on the order of the issuing 3416

authority. No such order is required for the payment, from the 3417
bond service fund or other special fund, when due of debt 3418
service or required payments under credit enhancement 3419
facilities. 3420
(2) Payments received by the issuing authority under 3421
interest rate hedges entered into as credit enhancement 3422
facilities under this section shall be deposited as provided in 3423
the applicable bond proceedings. 3424
(P) The obligations shall not be general obligations of 3425
the state and the full faith and credit, revenue, and taxing 3426
power of the state shall not be pledged to the payment of debt 3427
service on them or to any guarantee of the payment of that debt 3428
service. The holders or owners of the obligations shall have no 3429
right to have any moneys obligated or pledged for the payment of 3430
debt service except as provided in this section and in the 3431
applicable bond proceedings. The rights of the holders and 3432
owners to payment of debt service are limited to all or that 3433
portion of the pledged receipts, and those special funds, 3434
pledged to the payment of debt service pursuant to the bond 3435
proceedings in accordance with this section, and each obligation 3436
shall bear on its face a statement to that effect. 3437
(Q) Each bond service fund is a trust fund and is hereby 3438
pledged to the payment of debt service on the applicable 3439
obligations. Payment of that debt service shall be made or 3440
provided for by the issuing authority in accordance with the 3441
bond proceedings without necessity for any act of appropriation. 3442
The bond proceedings may provide for the establishment of 3443
separate accounts in the bond service fund and for the 3444
application of those accounts only to debt service on specific 3445
obligations, and for other accounts in the bond service fund 3446

commissioners as provided in the bond proceedings. Any 5956
obligations may be signed by the person who, on the date of 5957
execution, is the authorized signer although on the date of such 5958
obligations such person was not a commissioner. In case the 5959
individual whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature 5960
appears on any obligation ceases to be a commissioner before 5961
delivery of the obligation, such signature or facsimile is 5962
nevertheless valid and sufficient for all purposes as if that 5963
individual had remained the member until such delivery, and in 5964
case the seal to be affixed to or printed on obligations has 5965
been changed after the seal has been affixed to or a facsimile 5966
of the seal has been printed on the obligations, that seal or 5967
facsimile seal shall continue to be sufficient as to those 5968
obligations and obligations issued in substitution or exchange 5969
therefor. 5970
(I) The obligations are negotiable instruments and 5971
securities under Chapter 1308. of the Revised Code, subject to 5972

or both, as the commissioners determine. Provision may be made 5975
for the registration of any obligations with coupons attached as 5976
to principal alone or as to both principal and interest, their 5977
exchange for obligations so registered, and for the conversion 5978
or reconversion into obligations with coupons attached of any 5979
obligations registered as to both principal and interest, and 5980
for reasonable charges for such registration, exchange, 5981
conversion, and reconversion. Pending preparation of definitive 5982

agreement may contain the resolution authorizing the issuance of 5993
the obligations, any provisions that may be contained in the 5994
bond proceedings, and other provisions that are customary or 5995
appropriate in an agreement of the type. 5996
(L) Except to the extent that their rights are restricted 5997
by the bond proceedings, any holder of obligations, or a trustee 5998
under the bond proceedings may by any suitable form of legal 5999
proceedings protect and enforce any rights under the laws of 6000
this state or granted by the bond proceedings. Such rights 6001
include the right to compel the performance of all duties of the 6002
commissioners and the state. Each duty of the commissioners and 6003
its employees, and of each state agency and local government 6004
entity and its officers, members, or employees, undertaken 6005
pursuant to the bond proceedings, is hereby established as a 6006
duty of the commissioners, and of each such agency, local 6007
government entity, officer, member, or employee having authority 6008
to perform such duty, specifically enjoined by the law and 6009
resulting from an office, trust, or station within the meaning 6010
of section 2731.01 of the Revised Code. The persons who are at 6011

the treasurer of state shall electronically submit to the 6092
superintendent the data requested, including the amount of taxes 6093
collected and the name of the domestic insurance company from 6094

shall issue a tax bill within twenty days after receipt of an 6114
assessment certified by the superintendent of insurance under 6115
section 5725.20 of the Revised Code, but if such assessment 6116
reflects a late filed tax return, the treasurer of state shall 6117
add interest as provided in division (A) of section 5725.221 of 6118
the Revised Code and issue a tax bill. In the case of an 6119

difference is a deficiency and that deficiency is greater than 6129
one dollar, the treasurer of state shall add interest as 6130
provided in division (B)(1) of section 5725.221 of the Revised 6131

for payment to the taxpayer. If the taxpayer has a deficiency 6138
for one tax year and an excess for another tax year, or any 6139
combination thereof for more than two tax years, the treasurer 6140
of state may determine the net result after adding interest, if 6141
applicable, and, depending on if such result is greater than one 6142
dollar, proceed to issue a tax bill or certify a refund, as 6143
applicable. 6144
(E) Except as otherwise provided in this division, the 6145
treasurer of state may cancel a debt owed to the state arising 6146
from the tax imposed by section 5725.18 of the Revised Code, 6147
including any interest arising from such tax, if the total 6148

of state shall not cancel any debt that has been certified to 6150
the attorney general under division (F) of this section. 6151
(F) If a taxpayer fails to pay all taxes and interest, if 6152
any, on or before the due date shown on the tax bill issued by 6153
the treasurer of state, and if that unpaid amount has not been 6154
canceled pursuant to division (E) of this section, the treasurer 6155
of state shall add a penalty equal to five hundred dollars for 6156
each month the taxpayer fails to pay all taxes and interest due. 6157
The treasurer of state may add an additional penalty, not to 6158
exceed ten per cent of the taxes and interest due, if the 6159
taxpayer fails to demonstrate that the taxpayer made a good 6160
faith effort to pay all taxes and interest on or before the due 6161
date shown on the tax bill. The Unless a delinquent amount is 6162
canceled pursuant to division (E) of this section, the treasurer 6163
of state shall prepare a delinquent claim for each tax bill on 6164
which penalties were added and certify such claims to the 6165
attorney general for collection. The attorney general shall 6166
transmit a copy of each claim certified by the treasurer of 6167
state to the superintendent of insurance. For each claim 6168

recovered from a delinquent domestic insurance company or person 6178
in an action brought in the name of the state in the court of 6179
common pleas of Franklin county or any county in which such 6180
company or person has an office or place of business, and such 6181
court shall have jurisdiction of such action regardless of the 6182
amount involved. The attorney general, on request of the 6183
superintendent of insurance or tax commissionertreasurer of 6184
state, shall institute such action in the court of common pleas 6185
of Franklin county or any other county the superintendent or 6186
commissioner attorney general directs. In any such action, it 6187
shall be sufficient to allege that the tax, interest, and 6188
penalty sought to be recovered stand charged on the tax list of 6189
domestic insurance company franchise taxes in the office of the 6190
treasurer of state and have been unpaid for a period of forty- 6191
five days after having been placed thereon. Sums recovered in 6192
any such action shall be paid into the state treasury and 6193
distributed as provided in section 5725.24 of the Revised Code. 6194

the business done in this state during the calendar year in 6201
which the payment date provided by this paragraph is contained. 6202
Payments shall be made electronically as prescribed by the 6203
treasurer of state. The treasurer of state may adopt rules 6204
concerning the methods and timeliness of payments under this 6205
section. 6206
At the time of filing its annual statement, each foreign 6207
insurance company shall pay to the treasurer of state the tax 6208
assessable under section 3737.71 of the Revised Code and this 6209
chapter, calculated by such company from such annual statement. 6210
The company may deduct the part of such tax already paid as a 6211
partial payment. 6212
The superintendent shall determine the correctness of the 6213
reports and statements of insurance companies, compute the 6214
annual tax, and, on or before the fifteenth day of May, prepare 6215
and furnish to the treasurer of state lists of all taxable 6216
companies, showing as to each company the whole amount of the 6217
annual tax computed by the superintendent. The treasurer of 6218
state, after deducting the tax already paid, shall promptly 6219
notify each such company of any amount due, which amount shall 6220
be paid by each such company to the treasurer of state by the 6221
fifteenth day of June next succeeding. If a company has for any 6222
reason overpaid or was illegally or erroneously assessed or 6223
charged for collection a larger amount of tax than its annual 6224
tax as computed by the superintendent of insurance and an 6225
application for refund was timely filed under section 5729.102 6226

Sec. 5729.10. If a company fails to pay the tax levied by 6230
section 5729.03 of the Revised Code, or to make any partial 6231
payment thereof as required by law after a statement thereof has 6232
been made and mailed to it, or if the annual statement required 6233
by law to be made by it is false or incorrect, the 6234
superintendent of insurance may revoke the license of such 6235
company doing business in this state. Upon failure to pay the 6236
tax or to make partial payment thereof according to law, the 6237
treasurer of state shall certify that fact the tax liability and 6238
any related interest and penalties to the attorney general, who 6239
shall thereupon begin an action against the company in the court 6240
of common pleas of Franklin county, or any other county the 6241
attorney general elects, to recover the amount of the tax. If 6242
such company ceases to do business in this state, it shall 6243
thereupon make a report to the superintendent of the gross 6244
amount of premiums not theretofore reported as provided in 6245
section 5729.02 or 5729.04 of the Revised Code received by it 6246

(2) The heirs or legal representatives of deceased 6261
persons, and receivers and trustees in bankruptcy, appointed by 6262
any competent authority, may operate under the license of the 6263
person so succeeded in possession. 6264
(3) Two or more persons who are not partners may operate a 6265
single place of business under one license. In such case neither 6266
the retirement of any such person from business at that place of 6267
business, nor the entrance of any person, under an existing 6268
arrangement, shall affect the license or require the issuance of 6269
a new license, unless the person retiring from the business is 6270
the individual named on the vendor's license. 6271
Except as otherwise provided in this section, each 6272
applicant for a license shall make out and deliver to the county 6273
auditor of each county in which the applicant desires to engage 6274
in business, upon a blank to be furnished by such auditor for 6275
that purpose, a statement showing the name of the applicant, 6276
each place of business in the county where the applicant will 6277
make retail sales, the nature of the business, and any other 6278

form of a statement prescribed by the commissioner. 6280
At the time of making the application, the applicant shall 6281
pay into the county treasury a license fee in the sum of fifty 6282
dollars for each fixed place of business in the county that will 6283
be the situs of retail sales. Upon receipt of the application 6284
and exhibition of the county treasurer's receipt, showing the 6285
payment of the license fee, the county auditor shall issue to 6286
the applicant a license for each fixed place of business 6287
designated in the application, authorizing the applicant to 6288

treasurer of state attorney general for deposit into the state 6291
treasury to the credit of the organized crime commission fund 6292
for the purposes specified in section 177.011 of the Revised 6293
Code. The remaining twenty-five dollars of each license fee 6294
shall be credited to the general fund of the county. 6295
(B) If a vendor's identity changes, the vendor shall apply 6296
for a new license. If a vendor wishes to move an existing fixed 6297
place of business to a new location within the same county, the 6298
vendor shall obtain a new vendor's license or submit a request 6299
to the commissioner to transfer the existing vendor's license to 6300
the new location. When the new location has been verified as 6301
being within the same county, the commissioner shall authorize 6302
the transfer and notify the county auditor of the change of 6303
location. If a vendor wishes to move an existing fixed place of 6304
business to another county, the vendor's license shall not 6305
transfer and the vendor shall obtain a new vendor's license from 6306
the county in which the business is to be located. The form of 6307
the license shall be prescribed by the commissioner. The fees 6308
collected shall be credited as specified in division (A)(3) of 6309
this section. If a vendor fails to notify the commissioner of a 6310
change of location of its fixed place of business or that its 6311
business has closed, the commissioner may cancel the vendor's 6312
license if ordinary mail sent to the location shown on the 6313
license is returned because of an undeliverable address. 6314
(C) The commissioner may establish or participate in a 6315
registration system whereby any vendor may obtain a vendor's 6316
license by submitting to the commissioner a vendor's license 6317
application and a license fee of fifty dollars for each fixed 6318
place of business at which the vendor intends to make retail 6319

issue a vendor's license to the applicant on behalf of the 6321
county auditor of the county in which the applicant desires to 6322
engage in business, and shall forward a copy of the application 6323
and license fee to that county. Twenty-five dollars of each 6324
license fee received by the commissioner for the issuance of 6325
vendor's licenses shall be deposited into the vendor's license 6326
application fund, which is hereby created in the state treasury. 6327
The remaining twenty-five dollars of each license fee shall be 6328
deposited into the organized crime commission fund for the 6329
purposes specified in section 177.011 of the Revised Code. The 6330
commissioner shall certify to the director of budget and 6331
management within ten business days after the close of a month 6332
the license fees to be transmitted to each county from the 6333
vendor's license application fund for vendor's license 6334
applications received by the commissioner during that month. 6335
License fees transmitted to a county for which payment was not 6336
received by the commissioner may be netted against a future 6337
distribution to that county, including distributions made 6338
pursuant to section 5739.21 of the Revised Code. 6339

Chapter 5739. of the Revised Code pursuant to a permit issued by 6341
the division of liquor control shall obtain a vendor's license 6342
in the identical name and for the identical address as shown on 6343
the permit. 6344
Except as otherwise provided in this section, if a vendor 6345
has no fixed place of business and sells from a vehicle, each 6346
vehicle intended to be used within a county constitutes a place 6347
of business for the purpose of this section. 6348

titled motor vehicles, titled watercraft, or titled outboard 6352
motors, who effectuates leases that are taxed according to 6353
division (A)(2) of section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, or who, 6354

limited to, a hotel, rooming house, storeroom, building, part of 6362
a building, tent, vacant lot, railroad car, or motor vehicle 6363
that is temporarily occupied for the purpose of making retail 6364
sales of goods to the public. A place of business is not 6365
temporary if the same person conducted business at the place 6366
continuously for more than six months or occupied the premises 6367
as the person's permanent residence for more than six months, or 6368
if the person intends it to be a fixed place of business. 6369
Any transient vendor, in lieu of obtaining a vendor's 6370
license under division (A) of this section for counties in which 6371
the transient vendor has no fixed place of business, may apply 6372
to the tax commissioner, on a form prescribed by the 6373
commissioner, for a transient vendor's license. The transient 6374
vendor's license authorizes the transient vendor to make retail 6375
sales in any county in which the transient vendor does not 6376
maintain a fixed place of business. Any holder of a transient 6377
vendor's license shall not be required to obtain a separate 6378
vendor's license from the county auditor in that county. Upon 6379
the commissioner's determination that an applicant is a 6380

S. B. No. 300 Page 215

transient vendor, the applicant shall pay a license fee in the 6381
amount of fifty dollars, at which time the tax commissioner 6382
shall issue the license. Twenty-five dollars of that license fee 6383
shall be deposited into the organized crime commission fund for 6384
the purposes specified in section 177.011 of the Revised Code. 6385
The tax commissioner may require a vendor to be licensed as a 6386
transient vendor if, in the opinion of the commissioner, such 6387
licensing is necessary for the efficient administration of the 6388
tax. 6389
Any holder of a valid transient vendor's license may make 6390
retail sales at a temporary place of business or temporary 6391
exhibition, show, fair, flea market, or similar event, held 6392
anywhere in the state without complying with any provision of 6393
section 311.37 of the Revised Code. Any holder of a valid 6394
vendor's license may make retail sales as a transient vendor at 6395
a temporary place of business or temporary exhibition, show, 6396
fair, flea market, or similar event held in any county in which 6397
the vendor maintains a fixed place of business for which the 6398
vendor holds a vendor's license without obtaining a transient 6399
vendor's license. 6400
(E) Any vendor who is issued a license pursuant to this 6401
section shall display the license or a copy of it prominently, 6402
in plain view, at every place of business of the vendor. 6403
(F) No owner, organizer, or promoter who operates a fair, 6404
flea market, show, exhibition, convention, or similar event at 6405
which transient vendors are present shall fail to keep a 6406
comprehensive record of all such vendors, listing the vendor's 6407
name, permanent address, vendor's license number, and the type 6408
of goods sold. Such records shall be kept for four years and 6409
shall be open to inspection by the commissioner. 6410

Sec. 5747.51. (A) On or before the twenty-fifth day of 6414
July of each year, the tax commissioner shall make and certify 6415
to the county auditor of each county an estimate of the amount 6416
of the local government fund to be allocated to the undivided 6417
local government fund of each county for the ensuing calendar 6418
year, adjusting the total as required to account for 6419
subdivisions receiving local government funds under section 6420
5747.502 of the Revised Code. 6421
(B) At each annual regular session of the county budget 6422
commission convened pursuant to section 5705.27 of the Revised 6423
Code, each auditor shall present to the commission the 6424
certificate of the commissioner, the annual tax budget and 6425
estimates, and the records showing the action of the commission 6426
in its last preceding regular session. The commission, after 6427
extending to the representatives of each subdivision an 6428
opportunity to be heard, under oath administered by any member 6429
of the commission, and considering all the facts and information 6430
presented to it by the auditor, shall determine the amount of 6431
the undivided local government fund needed by and to be 6432
apportioned to each subdivision for current operating expenses, 6433
as shown in the tax budget of the subdivision. This 6434
determination shall be made pursuant to divisions (C) to (I) of 6435
this section, unless the commission has provided for a formula 6436
pursuant to section 5747.53 of the Revised Code. The 6437
commissioner shall reduce the amount of funds from the undivided 6438
local government fund to a subdivision required to receive 6439
reduced funds under section 5747.502 of the Revised Code. 6440

Nothing in this section prevents the budget commission, 6441
for the purpose of apportioning the undivided local government 6442
fund, from inquiring into the claimed needs of any subdivision 6443
as stated in its tax budget, or from adjusting claimed needs to 6444
reflect actual needs. For the purposes of this section, "current 6445
operating expenses" means the lawful expenditures of a 6446
subdivision, except those for permanent improvements and except 6447
payments for interest, sinking fund, and retirement of bonds, 6448
notes, and certificates of indebtedness of the subdivision. 6449
(C) The commission shall determine the combined total of 6450
the estimated expenditures, including transfers, from the 6451
general fund and any special funds other than special funds 6452
established for road and bridge; street construction, 6453
maintenance, and repair; state highway improvement; and gas, 6454
water, sewer, and electric public utilities operated by a 6455
subdivision, as shown in the subdivision's tax budget for the 6456
ensuing calendar year. 6457
(D) From the combined total of expenditures calculated 6458
pursuant to division (C) of this section, the commission shall 6459
deduct the following expenditures, if included in these funds in 6460
the tax budget: 6461
(1) Expenditures for permanent improvements as defined in 6462
division (E) of section 5705.01 of the Revised Code; 6463
(2) In the case of counties and townships, transfers to 6464
the road and bridge fund, and in the case of municipalities, 6465
transfers to the street construction, maintenance, and repair 6466
fund and the state highway improvement fund; 6467
(3) Expenditures for the payment of debt charges; 6468
(4) Expenditures for the payment of judgments. 6469

(E) In addition to the deductions made pursuant to 6470
division (D) of this section, revenues accruing to the general 6471
fund and any special fund considered under division (C) of this 6472
section from the following sources shall be deducted from the 6473
combined total of expenditures calculated pursuant to division 6474
(C) of this section: 6475
(1) Taxes levied within the ten-mill limitation, as 6476
defined in section 5705.02 of the Revised Code; 6477
(2) The budget commission allocation of estimated county 6478
public library fund revenues to be distributed pursuant to 6479
section 5747.48 of the Revised Code; 6480
(3) Estimated unencumbered balances as shown on the tax 6481
budget as of the thirty-first day of December of the current 6482
year in the general fund, but not any estimated balance in any 6483
special fund considered in division (C) of this section; 6484
(4) Revenue, including transfers, shown in the general 6485
fund and any special funds other than special funds established 6486
for road and bridge; street construction, maintenance, and 6487
repair; state highway improvement; and gas, water, sewer, and 6488
electric public utilities, from all other sources except those 6489
that a subdivision receives from an additional tax or service 6490
charge voted by its electorate or receives from special 6491
assessment or revenue bond collection. For the purposes of this 6492
division, where the charter of a municipal corporation prohibits 6493
the levy of an income tax, an income tax levied by the 6494
legislative authority of such municipal corporation pursuant to 6495
an amendment of the charter of that municipal corporation to 6496
authorize such a levy represents an additional tax voted by the 6497
electorate of that municipal corporation. For the purposes of 6498
this division, any measure adopted by a board of county 6499

electorate in a referendum conducted pursuant to section 6502
322.021, 4504.021, or 5739.022 of the Revised Code, shall not be 6503
considered an additional tax voted by the electorate. 6504
Money in a reserve balance account established by a 6505
county, township, or municipal corporation under section 5705.13 6506
of the Revised Code shall not be considered an unencumbered 6507
balance or revenue under division (E)(3) or (4) of this section. 6508
Money in a reserve balance account established by a township 6509
under section 5705.132 of the Revised Code shall not be 6510
considered an unencumbered balance or revenue under division (E) 6511
(3) or (4) of this section. 6512
If a county, township, or municipal corporation has 6513
created and maintains a nonexpendable trust fund under section 6514
5705.131 of the Revised Code, the principal of the fund, and any 6515
additions to the principal arising from sources other than the 6516
reinvestment of investment earnings arising from such a fund, 6517
shall not be considered an unencumbered balance or revenue under 6518
division (E)(3) or (4) of this section. Only investment earnings 6519
arising from investment of the principal or investment of such 6520
additions to principal may be considered an unencumbered balance 6521
or revenue under those divisions. 6522
(F) The total expenditures calculated pursuant to division 6523
(C) of this section, less the deductions authorized in divisions 6524
(D) and (E) of this section, shall be known as the "relative 6525
need" of the subdivision, for the purposes of this section. 6526
(G) The budget commission shall total the relative need of 6527
all participating subdivisions in the county, and shall compute 6528
a relative need factor by dividing the total estimate of the 6529

S. B. No. 300 Page 220
As Introduced
undivided local government fund by the total relative need of 6530
all participating subdivisions. 6531
(H) The relative need of each subdivision shall be 6532
multiplied by the relative need factor to determine the 6533
proportionate share of the subdivision in the undivided local 6534
government fund of the county; provided, that the maximum 6535
proportionate share of a county shall not exceed the following 6536
maximum percentages of the total estimate of the undivided local 6537
government fund governed by the relationship of the percentage 6538
of the population of the county that resides within municipal 6539
corporations within the county to the total population of the 6540
county as reported in the reports on population in Ohio by the 6541
department of development as of the twentieth day of July of the 6542
year in which the tax budget is filed with the budget 6543

D Eighty-one per cent or more Thirty per cent
Where the proportionate share of the county exceeds the 6546
limitations established in this division, the budget commission 6547
shall adjust the proportionate shares determined pursuant to 6548
this division so that the proportionate share of the county does 6549

proportionate shares of all other subdivisions on a pro rata 6551
basis. In counties having a population of less than one hundred 6552
thousand, not less than ten per cent shall be distributed to the 6553
townships therein. 6554
(I) The proportionate share of each subdivision in the 6555
undivided local government fund determined pursuant to division 6556
(H) of this section for any calendar year shall not be less than 6557
the product of the average of the percentages of the undivided 6558
local government fund of the county as apportioned to that 6559
subdivision for the calendar years 1968, 1969, and 1970, 6560
multiplied by the total amount of the undivided local government 6561
fund of the county apportioned pursuant to former section 6562
5739.23 of the Revised Code for the calendar year 1970. For the 6563
purposes of this division, the total apportioned amount for the 6564
calendar year 1970 shall be the amount actually allocated to the 6565
county in 1970 from the state collected intangible tax as levied 6566
by section 5707.03 of the Revised Code and distributed pursuant 6567
to section 5725.24 of the Revised Code, plus the amount received 6568
by the county in the calendar year 1970 pursuant to division (B) 6569
(1) of former section 5739.21 of the Revised Code, and 6570
distributed pursuant to former section 5739.22 of the Revised 6571
Code. If the total amount of the undivided local government fund 6572
for any calendar year is less than the amount of the undivided 6573
local government fund apportioned pursuant to former section 6574
5739.23 of the Revised Code for the calendar year 1970, the 6575
minimum amount guaranteed to each subdivision for that calendar 6576
year pursuant to this division shall be reduced on a basis 6577
proportionate to the amount by which the amount of the undivided 6578
local government fund for that calendar year is less than the 6579
amount of the undivided local government fund apportioned for 6580

(J) On the basis of such apportionment, the county auditor 6582
shall compute the percentage share of each such subdivision in 6583
the undivided local government fund and shall at the same time 6584
certify to the tax commissioner the percentage share of the 6585
county as a subdivision. No payment shall be made from the 6586
undivided local government fund, except in accordance with such 6587
percentage shares. 6588
Within ten days after the budget commission has made its 6589
apportionment, whether conducted pursuant to section 5747.51 or 6590
5747.53 of the Revised Code, the auditor shall publish a list of 6591
the subdivisions and the amount each is to receive from the 6592
undivided local government fund and the percentage share of each 6593
subdivision, in a newspaper or newspapers of countywide 6594
circulation, and send a copy of such allocation to the tax 6595
commissioner. 6596
The county auditor shall also send a copy of such 6597
allocation by ordinary or electronic mail to the fiscal officer 6598
of each subdivision entitled to participate in the allocation of 6599
the undivided local government fund of the county. This copy 6600
shall constitute the official notice of the commission action 6601
referred to in section 5705.37 of the Revised Code. 6602
All money received into the treasury of a subdivision from 6603
the undivided local government fund in a county treasury shall 6604

Sec. 6101.51. The treasurer of a conservancy district, at 6624
the time of taking office, shall execute to the district and 6625
deliver to the president of the board of directors of the 6626
district, a bond with good and sufficient sureties, to be 6627
approved by the board, conditioned that the treasurer shall 6628
account for and pay over as required by law, and as ordered by 6629
the board, all money received by the treasurer on the sale of 6630
bonds and notes or from any other source, that the treasurer 6631
only shall deliver the bonds and notes to the purchasers under 6632

section 6101.50 of the Revised Code, and that, when ordered by 6634
the board to do so, the treasurer shall return to the board, 6635
duly canceled, any bonds and notes not sold, which bonds and 6636
notes shall remain in the custody of the board, which shall 6637
produce them for inspection or for use as evidence whenever and 6638
wherever legally requested to do so. The cost of the bond of the 6639
treasurer shall be paid by the board from the funds of the 6640

and the interest payments coming due on all bonds and notes 6643
sold, and the treasurer of the district shall place sufficient 6644
funds at the place of payment to pay them. If proper 6645
appropriations are not made by the board as provided in this 6646
section, the treasurer of the district of the treasurer's own 6647
accord shall place funds at the place of payment and report that 6648
action to the next meeting of the board. The canceled bonds and 6649
coupons, receipted notes, and receipts of the treasurer shall be 6650
evidence of such payment. 6651
The successor in office of any treasurer of a conservancy 6652
district is not entitled to take over the assets of the treasury 6653
until the treasurer has complied with this section. Moneys 6654
derived from the sale of bonds and from all other sources shall 6655

of any of the bonds and notes shall be used only for paying the 6658
cost of the properties, works, and improvements and costs, 6659
expenses, fees, and salaries authorized by law. 6660
The district may secure the payment of loans from the 6661
United States government in the same manner as it may secure the 6662
payment of bonds, and the board may make any necessary 6663
regulations to provide for that payment. 6664
A party who has not sought a remedy against any proceeding 6665
under this chapter, until bonds or notes have been sold or the 6666
work constructed, cannot for any cause have an injunction 6667
