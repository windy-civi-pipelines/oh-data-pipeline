establish all necessary rules to guard against the occurrence of 24
fires and to protect the property and lives of the citizens 25
against damage and accidents, and may purchase, lease, lease 26
with an option to purchase, or otherwise provide any fire 27
apparatus, mechanical resuscitators, underwater rescue and 28
recovery equipment, or other fire equipment, appliances, 29
materials, fire hydrants, and water supply for fire-fighting and 30
fire and rescue purposes that seems advisable to the board. The 31
board shall provide for the care and maintenance of such fire 32
equipment, and, for these purposes, may purchase, lease, lease 33
with an option to purchase, or construct and maintain necessary 34
buildings, and it may establish and maintain lines of fire-alarm 35
communications within the limits of the township. The board may 36

equipment, or it may enter into an agreement with a volunteer 38
fire company for the use and operation of the equipment. The 39
board may compensate the members of a volunteer fire company on 40
any basis and in any amount that it considers equitable. 41
When the estimated cost to purchase fire apparatus, 42

equipment, or other fire equipment, appliances, materials, fire 44
hydrants, buildings, or fire-alarm communications equipment or 45
services exceeds the amount specified in section 9.17 of the 46
Revised Code, the contract shall be let by competitive bidding. 47
No purchase or other transaction subject to this section shall 48
be divided into component parts in order to avoid the 49

Section 30:
5705.01 of the Revised Code. 411
Sec. 3311.21. (A) In addition to the resolutions 412
authorized by sections 5705.194, 5705.199, 5705.21, 5705.212, 413
and 5705.213 of the Revised Code, the board of education of a 414
joint vocational or cooperative education school district by a 415
vote of two-thirds of its full membership may at any time adopt 416
a resolution declaring the necessity to levy a tax in excess of 417
the ten-mill limitation for a period not to exceed ten years to 418
provide funds for any one or more of the following purposes, 419
which may be stated in the following manner in such resolution, 420
the ballot, and the notice of election: purchasing a site or 421
enlargement thereof and for the erection and equipment of 422
buildings; for the purpose of enlarging, improving, or 423
rebuilding thereof; for the purpose of providing for the current 424
expenses of the joint vocational or cooperative school district; 425
or for a continuing period for the purpose of providing for the 426
current expenses of the joint vocational or cooperative 427
education school district. The resolution shall specify the 428
amount of the proposed rate and, if a renewal, whether the levy 429
is to renew all, or a portion of, the existing levy, and shall 430
specify the first year in which the levy will be imposed. If the 431
levy provides for but is not limited to current expenses, the 432
resolution shall apportion the annual rate of the levy between 433
current expenses and the other purpose or purposes. Such 434
apportionment may but need not be the same for each year of the 435
levy, but the respective portions of the rate actually levied 436
each year for current expenses and the other purpose or purposes 437
shall be limited by such apportionment. The portion of any such 438
rate actually levied for current expenses of a joint vocational 439

The portion of any such rate not apportioned to the current 442
expenses of a joint vocational or cooperative education school 443
district shall be used in applying division (B) of this section. 444
On the adoption of such resolution, the joint vocational or 445
cooperative education school district board of education shall 446
certify the resolution to the board of elections of the county 447
containing the most populous portion of the district, which 448
board shall receive resolutions for filing and send them to the 449
boards of elections of each county in which territory of the 450
district is located, furnish all ballots for the election as 451
provided in section 3505.071 of the Revised Code, and prepare 452
the election notice; and the board of elections of each county 453
in which the territory of such district is located shall make 454
the other necessary arrangements for the submission of the 455
question to the electors of the joint vocational or cooperative 456
education school district at the next primary or general 457
election occurring not less than ninety days after the 458
resolution was received from the joint vocational or cooperative 459
education school district board of education, or at a special 460
election to be held at a time designated by the district board 461
of education consistent with the requirements of section 3501.01 462
of the Revised Code, which date shall not be earlier than ninety 463
days after the adoption and certification of the resolution. 464
The board of elections of the county or counties in which 465
territory of the joint vocational or cooperative education 466
school district is located shall cause to be published in a 467
newspaper of general circulation in that district an 468
advertisement of the proposed tax levy question, together with a 469
statement of the amount of the proposed levy once a week for two 470

consecutive weeks or as provided in section 7.16 of the Revised 471
Code, prior to the election at which the question is to appear 472
on the ballot. If the board of elections operates and maintains 473
a web site, the board also shall post the advertisement on its 474
web site for thirty days prior to that election. 475
If a majority of the electors voting on the question of 476
levying such tax vote in favor of the levy, the joint vocational 477
or cooperative education school district board of education 478
shall annually make the levy within the district at the rate 479
specified in the resolution and ballot or at any lesser rate, 480
and the county auditor of each affected county shall annually 481
place the levy on the tax list and duplicate of each school 482
district in the county having territory in the joint vocational 483
or cooperative education school district. The taxes realized 484
from the levy shall be collected at the same time and in the 485
same manner as other taxes on the duplicate, and the taxes, when 486
collected, shall be paid to the treasurer of the joint 487
vocational or cooperative education school district and 488
deposited to a special fund, which shall be established by the 489
joint vocational or cooperative education school district board 490
of education for all revenue derived from any tax levied 491
pursuant to this section and for the proceeds of anticipation 492
notes which shall be deposited in such fund. After the approval 493
of the levy, the joint vocational or cooperative education 494
school district board of education may anticipate a fraction of 495
the proceeds of the levy and from time to time, during the life 496
of the levy, but in any year prior to the time when the tax 497
collection from the levy so anticipated can be made for that 498
year, issue anticipation notes in an amount not exceeding fifty 499
per cent of the estimated proceeds of the levy to be collected 500
in each year up to a period of five years after the date of the 501

the levy obligated for each year by the issuance of anticipation 503
notes, provided that the total amount maturing in any one year 504
shall not exceed fifty per cent of the anticipated proceeds of 505
the levy for that year. Each issue of notes shall be sold as 506
provided in Chapter 133. of the Revised Code, and shall, except 507
for such limitation that the total amount of such notes maturing 508
in any one year shall not exceed fifty per cent of the 509
anticipated proceeds of the levy for that year, mature serially 510
in substantially equal installments, during each year over a 511
period not to exceed five years after their issuance. 512
(B) Prior to the application of section 319.301 of the 513
Revised Code, the rate of a levy that is limited to, or to the 514
extent that it is apportioned to, purposes other than current 515
expenses shall be reduced in the same proportion in which the 516
district's total valuation increases during the life of the levy 517
because of additions to such valuation that have resulted from 518
improvements added to the tax list and duplicate. 519
(C) The form of ballot cast at an election under division 520
(A) of this section shall be as prescribed by section 5705.25 of 521
the Revised Code. 522

A county school financing district may include the 535
territory of a city, local, or exempted village school district 536
whose territory also is included in the territory of one or more 537
other county school financing districts. 538
(2) "The county auditor's appraised value" and "effective 539
rate" have the same meanings as in section 5705.01 of the 540
Revised Code. 541
(B) The governing board of any educational service center 542
may, by resolution, declare that the territory of the 543
educational service center is a county school financing 544
district. The resolution shall state the purpose for which the 545
county school financing district is created, which may be for 546
any one or more of the following purposes: 547
(1) To levy taxes for the provision of special education 548
by the school districts that are a part of the district, 549
including taxes for permanent improvements for special 550
education; 551
(2) To levy taxes for the provision of specified 552
educational programs and services by the school districts that 553

The governing board of the educational service center that 563
creates a county school financing district shall serve as the 564
taxing authority of the district and may use educational service 565
center governing board employees to perform any of the functions 566
necessary in the performance of its duties as a taxing 567

With the approval of a majority of the members of the 570
board of education of each school district within the territory 571
of the county school financing district, the taxing authority of 572
the financing district may amend the resolution creating the 573
district to broaden or narrow the purposes for which it was 574
created. 575
A governing board of an educational service center may 576
create more than one county school financing district. If a 577
governing board of an educational service center creates more 578

districts it creates by including a designation of each 580
district's purpose in the district's name. 581

become a part of the county school financing district unless the 594
county school financing district has in effect a tax imposed 595
under section 5705.215 of the Revised Code. If the county school 596
financing district has such a tax in effect, the taxing 597
authority shall certify a copy of its resolution accepting the 598
school district's territory to the school district's board of 599
education. The board of education and the county auditor shall 600
proceed in the same manner as required for a tax levy under 601

Section 32:
section 5705.03 of the Revised Code, except that the levy's 602
annual collections shall be estimated assuming that the school 603
district's territory has been added to the county school 604
financing district. After receipt of the auditor's certification 605
under that section, the board may adopt a resolution, with the 606
affirmative vote of a majority of its members, proposing the 607
submission to the electors of the question of whether the 608
district's territory shall become a part of the county school 609
financing district and subject to the taxes imposed by the 610
financing district. The resolution shall set forth the date on 611
which the question shall be submitted to the electors, which 612
shall be at a special election held on a date specified in the 613
resolution, which shall not be earlier than ninety days after 614
the adoption and certification of the resolution. A copy of the 615
resolution shall immediately be certified to the board of 616
elections of the proper county, which shall make arrangements 617
for the submission of the proposal to the electors of the school 618
district. The board of the joining district shall publish notice 619
of the election in a newspaper of general circulation in the 620

web site, the board of elections shall post notice of the 624
election on its web site for thirty days prior to the election. 625
The question appearing on the ballot shall read: 626
"Shall the territory within __________ (name of the school 627
district proposing to join the county school financing district) 628
__________ be added to __________ (name) __________ county 629
school financing district, and a property tax for the purposes 630
of _________ (here insert purposes), that the county auditor 631
estimates will collect $_____ annually, __________ at a rate not 632
exceeding __________ mills for each $1 of taxable value, which 633
amounts to $__________ (effective rate) for each $100,000 of the 634
county auditor's appraised value, ___________ be in effect for 635
__________ (here insert the number of years the tax is to be in 636
effect or "a continuing period of time," as applicable) 637

If the proposal is approved by a majority of the electors 639
voting on it, the joinder shall take effect on the first day of 640
July following the date of the election, and the county board of 641
elections shall notify the county auditor of each county in 642
which the school district joining its territory to the county 643
school financing district is located. 644
(D) The board of any city, local, or exempted village 645
school district whose territory is part of a county school 646
financing district may withdraw its territory from the county 647
school financing district thirty days after submitting to the 648
governing board that is the taxing authority of the district and 649
the state board a resolution proclaiming such withdrawal, 650

As Introduced
adopted by a majority vote of its members, but any county school 651
financing district tax levied in such territory on the effective 652
date of the withdrawal shall remain in effect in such territory 653
until such tax expires or is renewed. No board may adopt a 654
resolution withdrawing from a county school financing district 655
that would take effect during the forty-five days preceding the 656
date of an election at which a levy proposed under section 657

Section 34:
5705.215 of the Revised Code is to be voted upon. 658
(E) A city, local, or exempted village school district 659
does not lose its separate identity or legal existence by reason 660
of joining its territory to a county school financing district 661
under this section and an educational service center does not 662
lose its separate identity or legal existence by reason of 663
creating a county school financing district that accepts or 664
loses territory under this section. 665
Sec. 3318.05. For purposes of this section, "conditional 666
approval" includes any conditional approval made by the Ohio 667
facilities commission and approved by the controlling board in 668
calendar year 2023. 669
The conditional approval of the Ohio facilities 670
construction commission for a project shall lapse and the amount 671
reserved and encumbered for such project shall be released 672
unless the school district board accepts such conditional 673
approval within one hundred twenty days following the date of 674
certification of the conditional approval to the school district 675
board and the electors of the school district vote favorably on 676
both of the propositions described in divisions (A) and (B) of 677
this section within sixteen months of the date of such 678

propositions described in divisions (A) and (B) of this section 682
shall be combined in a single proposal. If the district board or 683
the district's electors fail to meet such requirements and the 684
amount reserved and encumbered for the district's project is 685
released, the district shall be given first priority for project 686
funding as such funds become available, subject to section 687

Section 36:
section 5705.21 of the Revised Code for general permanent 704
improvements for a continuing period of time and the proceeds of 705

Section 39:
section 3318.41 of the Revised Code, the commission shall enter 866
into an agreement with the school district board for the 867
construction and sale of the project. In either case, the 868
agreement shall include, but need not be limited to, the 869
following provisions: 870
(A) The sale and issuance of bonds or notes in 871
anticipation thereof, as soon as practicable after the execution 872
of the agreement, in an amount equal to the school district's 873
portion of the basic project cost, including any securities 874

Code and dedicated by the school district board to payment of 876
the district's portion of the basic project cost of the project; 877
provided, that if at that time the county treasurer of each 878
county in which the school district is located has not commenced 879
the collection of taxes on the general duplicate of real and 880
public utility property for the year in which the controlling 881
board approved the project, the school district board shall 882
authorize the issuance of a first installment of bond 883
anticipation notes in an amount specified by the agreement, 884
which amount shall not exceed an amount necessary to raise the 885
net bonded indebtedness of the school district as of the date of 886
the controlling board's approval to within five thousand dollars 887
of the required level of indebtedness for the preceding year. In 888
the event that a first installment of bond anticipation notes is 889
issued, the school district board shall, as soon as practicable 890

The combined value of the first and second installment of 897
bond anticipation notes or the value of the first and final 898
issue of bonds shall be equal to the school district's portion 899
of the basic project cost. The proceeds of any such bonds shall 900
be used first to retire any bond anticipation notes. Otherwise, 901
the proceeds of such bonds and of any bond anticipation notes, 902
except the premium and accrued interest thereon, shall be 903
deposited in the school district's project construction fund. In 904
determining the amount of net bonded indebtedness for the 905
purpose of fixing the amount of an issue of either bonds or bond 906
anticipation notes, gross indebtedness shall be reduced by 907
moneys in the bond retirement fund only to the extent of the 908
moneys therein on the first day of the year preceding the year 909
in which the controlling board approved the project. Should 910
there be a decrease in the tax valuation of the school district 911
so that the amount of indebtedness that can be incurred on the 912
tax duplicates for the year in which the controlling board 913
approved the project is less than the amount of the first 914
installment of bond anticipation notes, there shall be paid from 915
the school district's project construction fund to the school 916
district's bond retirement fund to be applied against such notes 917
an amount sufficient to cause the net bonded indebtedness of the 918
school district, as of the first day of the year following the 919
year in which the controlling board approved the project, to be 920
within five thousand dollars of the required level of 921
indebtedness for the year in which the controlling board 922
approved the project. The maximum amount of indebtedness to be 923

bonded indebtedness, as of the first day of the year following 926
the year in which the controlling board approved the project, to 927
be within five thousand dollars of the required level of 928
indebtedness, or an amount equal to the required percentage of 929
the basic project costs, whichever is greater. All bonds and 930
bond anticipation notes shall be issued in accordance with 931
Chapter 133. of the Revised Code, and notes may be renewed as 932
provided in section 133.22 of the Revised Code. 933

school district, the board of education shall distribute the 2492
partnering community schools amount among the then qualifying 2493
community schools not more than forty-five days after the school 2494
district receives and deposits each tax distribution. From each 2495
tax distribution, each such partnering community school shall 2496
receive a portion of the partnering community schools amount in 2497
the proportion that the number of its resident students bears to 2498
the aggregate number of resident students of all such partnering 2499
community schools as of the date of receipt and deposit of the 2500
tax distribution. 2501
(b) If the qualifying school district is not a municipal 2502
school district, the board of education may distribute all or a 2503
portion of the amount in the partnering community schools fund 2504
during a fiscal year to partnering community schools on or 2505
before the first day of June of the preceding fiscal year. Each 2506
such partnering community school shall receive a portion of the 2507
amount distributed by the board from the partnering community 2508
schools fund during the fiscal year in the proportion that the 2509
number of its resident students bears to the aggregate number of 2510
resident students of all such partnering community schools as of 2511
the date the school district received and deposited the most 2512
recent tax distribution. On or before the fifteenth day of June 2513
of each fiscal year, the board of education shall announce an 2514
estimated allocation to partnering community schools for the 2515

ensuing fiscal year. The board is not required to allocate to 2516
partnering community schools the entire partnering community 2517
schools amount in the fiscal year in which a tax distribution is 2518
received and deposited in the partnering community schools fund. 2519
The estimated allocation shall be published on the web site of 2520
the school district and expressed as a dollar amount per 2521
resident student. The actual allocation to community schools in 2522
a fiscal year need not conform to the estimate published by the 2523
school district so long if the estimate was made in good faith. 2524
Distributions by a school district under division (B)(3) 2525
(b) of this section shall be made in accordance with 2526
distribution agreements entered into by the board of education 2527
and each partnering community school eligible for distributions 2528

certified to the department of education each fiscal year before 2530
the thirtieth day of July. Each agreement shall provide for at 2531
least three distributions by the school district to the 2532
partnering community school during the fiscal year and shall 2533
require the initial distribution be made on or before the 2534
thirtieth day of July. 2535
(c) For the purposes of division (B) of this section, the 2536
number of resident students shall be the number of such students 2537
reported under section 3317.03 of the Revised Code and 2538
established by the department of education as of the date of 2539
receipt and deposit of the tax distribution. 2540

partnering community school under division (B)(6)(b) of this 2544

Section 111:
section, the board of education of the school district shall 2545

section includes only the taxes charged and payable under that 2553
levy for the current expenses of the school district, and does 2554
not include the taxes charged and payable for the current 2555
expenses of partnering community schools. The taxes charged and 2556
payable for the current expenses of partnering community schools 2557
shall not affect the calculation of "state education aid" as 2558
defined in section 5751.20 of the Revised Code. 2559

partnering community schools, and the denominator of which is 2585
the total number of mills per dollar of taxable value authorized 2586
by the electors in the election held under division (B) of this 2587

school safety and security may report to the department of 2728
education how the district is using revenue from that tax. 2729
The board of education of any school district that 2730
proposes to levy a tax for the purpose of providing for school 2731
safety and security may share the proceeds of the tax with 2732
chartered nonpublic schools, as defined by section 3310.01 of 2733
the Revised Code, that are located in the territory of the 2734
school district as provided in this division. The resolution 2735
levying the tax and the form of the ballot shall state that 2736
proceeds from the levy are to be shared with chartered nonpublic 2737
schools and shall state the percentage of the proceeds that is 2738

If a percentage of the proceeds of such a tax are to be 2740
shared with chartered nonpublic schools under this division, 2741
such proceeds shall be shared with all chartered nonpublic 2742
schools located in the territory of the school district. Of the 2743
percentage of the proceeds to be shared with chartered nonpublic 2744

same proportion of that percentage that the number of resident 2746
students attending that school bears to the total number of 2747
resident students attending all such schools in the territory of 2748
the school district. For the purposes of this section, a 2749

Sec. 5705.212. (A)(1) The board of education of any school 2762
district, at any time and by a vote of two-thirds of all of its 2763
members, may declare by resolution that the amount of taxes that 2764
may be raised within the ten-mill limitation will be 2765
insufficient to provide an adequate amount for the present and 2766
future requirements of the school district, that it is necessary 2767
to levy not more than five taxes in excess of that limitation 2768
for current expenses, and that each of the proposed taxes first 2769
will be levied in a different year, over a specified period of 2770
time. The board shall identify the taxes proposed under this 2771

Section 120:
section as follows: the first tax to be levied shall be called 2772
the "original tax." Each tax subsequently levied shall be called 2773
an "incremental tax." The rate of each incremental tax shall be 2774
identical, but the rates of such incremental taxes need not be 2775
the same as the rate of the original tax. The resolution also 2776
shall state that the question of these additional taxes shall be 2777
submitted to the electors of the school district at a special 2778
election. The resolution shall specify separately for each tax 2779
proposed: the amount of the increase in rate that it is 2780
necessary to levy, expressed separately for the original tax and 2781
each incremental tax; that the purpose of the levy is for 2782
current expenses; the number of years during which the original 2783
tax shall be in effect; a specification that the last year in 2784
which the original tax is in effect shall also be the last year 2785
in which each incremental tax shall be in effect; and the year 2786

in which each tax first is proposed to be levied. The original 2787
tax may be levied for any number of years not exceeding ten, or 2788
for a continuing period of time. The resolution shall specify 2789
the date of holding the special election, which shall not be 2790
earlier than ninety days after the adoption and certification of 2791
the resolution and shall be consistent with the requirements of 2792

Section 121:

levying a tax and specify all of the following: 2798
(a) That the tax shall be called and designated on the 2799
ballot as a renewal levy; 2800
(b) The rate of the renewal tax, which shall be a single 2801
rate that combines the rate of the original tax and each 2802
incremental tax into a single rate. The rate of the renewal tax 2803
shall not exceed the aggregate rate of the original and 2804
incremental taxes. 2805
(c) The number of years, not to exceed ten, that the 2806
renewal tax will be levied, or that it will be levied for a 2807
continuing period of time; 2808

expenses; 2810
(e) Subject to the certification and notification 2811
requirements of section 5705.251 of the Revised Code, that the 2812
question of the renewal levy shall be submitted to the electors 2813

its adoption, a copy of the resolution shall be certified to the 2822
board of elections of the proper county in the manner provided 2823
by division (A) of section 5705.251 of the Revised Code, and 2824
that division shall govern the arrangements for the submission 2825
of the question and other matters concerning the election to 2826
which that section refers. The election shall be held on the 2827
date specified in the resolution. If a majority of the electors 2828
voting on the question so submitted in an election vote in favor 2829
of the taxes or a renewal tax, the board of education, if the 2830
original or a renewal tax is authorized to be levied for the 2831
current year, immediately may make the necessary levy within the 2832
school district at the authorized rate, or at any lesser rate in 2833
excess of the ten-mill limitation, for the purpose stated in the 2834
resolution. No tax shall be imposed prior to the year specified 2835
in the resolution as the year in which it is first proposed to 2836
be levied. The rate of the original tax and the rate of each 2837
incremental tax shall be cumulative, so that the aggregate rate 2838
levied in any year is the sum of the rates of both the original 2839
tax and all incremental taxes levied in or prior to that year 2840
under the same proposal. A tax levied for a continuing period of 2841
time under this section may be reduced pursuant to section 2842

Section 122:

may anticipate a fraction of the proceeds of the levy and issue 2848
anticipation notes in an amount not to exceed fifty per cent of 2849
the total estimated proceeds of the levy to be collected during 2850
the first year of the levy. The notes shall be sold as provided 2851
in Chapter 133. of the Revised Code. If anticipation notes are 2852
issued, they shall mature serially and in substantially equal 2853
amounts during each year over a period not to exceed five years; 2854
and the amount necessary to pay the interest and principal as 2855
the anticipation notes mature shall be deemed appropriated for 2856
those purposes from the levy, and appropriations from the levy 2857
by the board of education shall be limited each fiscal year to 2858
the balance available in excess of that amount. 2859
If the auditor of state has certified a deficit pursuant 2860
to section 3313.483 of the Revised Code, the notes authorized 2861
under this section may be sold in accordance with Chapter 133. 2862

any of the levy proceeds are so allocated, of the school 2871
district, and that each of the proposed taxes first will be 2872
levied in a different year, over a specified period of time. A 2873
qualifying school district that is not a municipal school 2874
district may allocate all of the levy proceeds to partnering 2875
community schools. A municipal school district shall allocate a 2876
portion of the levy proceeds to the current expenses of the 2877

but the rates of such incremental taxes need not be the same as 2881
the rate of the original tax. In addition to the specifications 2882
required of the resolution in division (A) of this section, the 2883
resolution shall state the number of the mills to be levied each 2884
year for the current expenses of the partnering community 2885
schools and the number of the mills, if any, to be levied each 2886
year for the current expenses of the school district. The number 2887
of mills for the current expenses of partnering community 2888
schools shall be the same for each of the incremental taxes, and 2889
the number of mills for the current expenses of the qualifying 2890
school district shall be the same for each of the incremental 2891
taxes. 2892
The levy of taxes for the current expenses of a partnering 2893
community school under division (C) of this section and the 2894
distribution of proceeds from the tax by a qualifying school 2895
district to partnering community schools is hereby determined to 2896

district, at any time and by a vote of two-thirds of all of its 2972
members, may declare by resolution that the amount of taxes that 2973

issued, they shall mature serially and in substantially equal 3063
amounts during each year over a period not to exceed five years; 3064
and the amount necessary to pay the interest and principal as 3065
the anticipation notes mature shall be deemed appropriated for 3066
those purposes from the levy, and appropriations from the levy 3067

manner as a school board may submit a levy under division (C) of 3083

Section 128:
section 5705.21 of the Revised Code, except that: 3084
(1) The levy may be for a period not to exceed ten years, 3085

health personnel, social workers, and counselors. 3105
(B) If the levy provides for but is not limited to current 3106
expenses, the resolutions shall apportion the annual rate of the 3107
levy between current expenses and the other purposes. The 3108
apportionment need not be the same for each year of the levy, 3109
but the respective portions of the rate actually levied each 3110
year for current expenses and the other purposes shall be 3111
limited by that apportionment. 3112
(C) Prior to the application of section 319.301 of the 3113
Revised Code, the rate of a levy that is limited to, or to the 3114
extent that it is apportioned to, purposes other than current 3115
expenses shall be reduced in the same proportion in which the 3116

district's total valuation increases during the life of the levy 3117
because of additions to such valuation that have resulted from 3118

(D) After the approval of a county school financing 3120
district levy under this section, the taxing authority may 3121
anticipate a fraction of the proceeds of such levy and may from 3122
time to time during the life of such levy, but in any given year 3123

exceeding fifty per cent of the estimated proceeds of the levy 3126
to be collected in each year up to a period of five years after 3127
the date of the issuance of such notes, less an amount equal to 3128
the proceeds of such levy obligated for each year by the 3129
issuance of anticipation notes, provided that the total amount 3130
maturing in any one year shall not exceed fifty per cent of the 3131
anticipated proceeds of the levy for that year. Each issue of 3132
notes shall be sold as provided in Chapter 133. of the Revised 3133
Code, and shall, except for the limitation that the total amount 3134
of such notes maturing in any one year shall not exceed fifty 3135
per cent of the anticipated proceeds of such levy for that year, 3136
mature serially in substantially equal installments during each 3137
year over a period not to exceed five years after their 3138
issuance. 3139
(E)(1) In a resolution to be submitted to the taxing 3140
authority of a county school financing district under division 3141
(A) of this section calling for a ballot issue on the question 3142
of the levying of a tax for a continuing period of time by the 3143
taxing authority, the board of education of a school district 3144
that is part of the territory of the county school financing 3145
district also may propose to reduce the rate of one or more of 3146
that school district's property taxes levied for a continuing 3147

As Introduced
period of time in excess of the ten-mill limitation. The 3148
reduction in the rate of a property tax may be any amount, not 3149
exceeding the rate at which the tax is authorized to be levied. 3150
The reduction in the rate of a tax shall first take effect in 3151
the same year that the county school financing district tax 3152
takes effect, and shall continue for each year that the county 3153
school financing district tax is in effect. A board of 3154
education's resolution proposing to reduce the rate of one or 3155
more of its school district property taxes shall, in addition to 3156
including information required for a resolution under division 3157
(B)(1) of section 5705.03 of the Revised Code, specifically 3158
identify each such tax and shall state for each tax the maximum 3159
rate at which it currently may be levied and the maximum rate at 3160
which it could be levied after the proposed reduction, expressed 3161
in mills for each one dollar of taxable value. 3162
Before submitting the resolution to the taxing authority 3163
of the county school financing district, the board of education 3164
of the school district shall certify a copy of it to the tax 3165
commissioner and the county auditor. The county auditor shall 3166
certify to the board all information required under division (B) 3167
(2) of section 5705.03 of the Revised Code, in the manner 3168
required under that division, and both of the following: 3169
(a) An estimate of the levy's annual collections beginning 3170
for the first year for which the reduction applies, rounded to 3171
the nearest dollar, which shall be calculated assuming that the 3172
amount of the tax list of the taxing authority remains 3173
throughout the life of the reduced levy the same as the amount 3174
of the tax list most recently certified by the county auditor 3175
under division (A) of section 319.28 of the Revised Code. 3176
If a school district is located in more than one county, 3177
H. B. No. 420 Page 108
As Introduced
the county auditor shall obtain from the county auditor of each 3178
other county in which the district is located the current tax 3179
valuation for the portion of the district in that county. 3180
(b) The effective rate of the levy for the last year 3181
before the proposed reduction and the first year that the 3182
reduction applies, both expressed in dollars for each one 3183
hundred thousand dollars of the county auditor's appraised 3184
value. 3185
The tax commissioner, within ten days of receiving the 3186
resolution, shall certify to the board the reduction in the 3187
school district's total effective tax rate for each class of 3188
property that would have resulted if the proposed reduction in 3189
the rate or rates had been in effect the previous year. As used 3190
in this paragraph, "effective tax rate" has the same meaning as 3191
in section 323.08 of the Revised Code. 3192
After receiving these certifications from the commissioner 3193
and the auditor, the board may amend its resolution to change 3194
the proposed property tax rate reduction before submitting the 3195
resolution to the financing district taxing authority, provided 3196
the board certifies a copy of the amended resolution to the 3197
county auditor with a request to provide the information 3198
required under divisions (E)(1)(a) and (b) of this section and 3199
the auditor transmits that information to the taxing authority. 3200
If the board of education of a school district that is 3201
part of the territory of a county school financing district 3202
adopts a resolution proposing to reduce the rate of one or more 3203
of its property taxes in conjunction with the levying of a tax 3204
by the financing district, the resolution submitted by the board 3205
to the taxing authority of the financing district under division 3206

(2) Each school district that is part of the territory of 3211
a county school financing district may tailor to its own 3212
situation a proposed reduction in one or more property tax rates 3213
in conjunction with the proposed levying of a tax by the county 3214
school financing district; if one such school district proposes 3215
a reduction in one or more tax rates, another school district 3216
may propose a reduction of a different size or may propose no 3217
reduction. Within each school district that is part of the 3218
territory of the county school financing district, the electors 3219
shall vote on one ballot issue combining the question of the 3220
levying of the tax by the taxing authority of the county school 3221
financing district with, if any such reduction is proposed, the 3222
question of the reduction in the rate of one or more taxes of 3223
the school district. If a majority of the electors of the county 3224
school financing district voting on the question of the proposed 3225
levying of a tax by the taxing authority of the financing 3226
district vote to approve the question, any tax reductions 3227
proposed by school districts that are part of the territory of 3228
the financing district also are approved. 3229
(3) The form of the ballot for an issue proposing to levy 3230
a county school financing district tax in conjunction with the 3231
reduction of the rate of one or more school district taxes shall 3232
be as follows: 3233
"Shall the _______ (name of the county school financing 3234
district) be authorized to levy an additional tax for _______ 3235
(purpose stated in the resolutions), that the county auditor 3236
estimates will collect $_____ annually, at a rate not exceeding 3237

financing district tax is approved, the rate of an existing tax 3241
currently levied by the _______ (name of the school district of 3242
which the elector is a resident) at the rate of _______ mills 3243
shall be reduced to _______ mills for each $1 of taxable value, 3244
which amounts to a reduction from $_______ (effective rate) to 3245
$_______ (effective rate) for each $100,000 of the county 3246
auditor's appraised value, that the county auditor estimates 3247
will collect $_____ annually, until any such time as the county 3248

FOR THE TAX LEVY
"
AGAINST THE TAX LEVY
If the board of education of the school district proposes 3251
to reduce the rate of more than one of its existing taxes, the 3252
second sentence of the ballot language shall be modified for 3253
residents of that district to express the rates and effective 3254
rates at which those taxes currently are levied and the rates 3255
and effective rates to which they would be reduced as well as 3256
each levy's estimated annual collections, as provided by the 3257
county auditor under division (E)(1)(a) of this section. If the 3258
board of education of the school district does not propose to 3259
reduce the rate of any of its taxes, the second sentence of the 3260
ballot language shall not be used for residents of that 3261
district. In any case, the first sentence of the ballot language 3262
shall be the same for all the electors in the county school 3263
financing district, but the second sentence shall be different 3264
in each school district depending on whether and in what amount 3265
H. B. No. 420 Page 111
As Introduced
the board of education of the school district proposes to reduce 3266
the rate of one or more of its property taxes. 3267
(4) If the rate of a school district property tax is 3268
reduced pursuant to this division, the tax commissioner shall 3269
compute the percentage required to be computed for that tax 3270
under division (D) of section 319.301 of the Revised Code each 3271
year the rate is reduced as if the tax had been levied in the 3272
preceding year at the rate to which it has been reduced. If the 3273
reduced rate of a tax is increased under division (E)(5) of this 3274

Section 129:
section, the commissioner shall compute the percentage required 3275
to be computed for that tax under division (D) of section 3276

Section 130:
319.301 of the Revised Code each year the rate is increased as 3277
if the tax had been levied in the preceding year at the rate to 3278
which it has been increased. 3279
(5) After the levying of a county school financing 3280
district tax in conjunction with the reduction of the rate of 3281
one or more school district taxes is approved by the electors 3282
under this division, if the rate of the county school financing 3283
district tax is decreased pursuant to an election under section 3284

Section 131:
5705.261 of the Revised Code, the rate of each school district 3285
tax that had been reduced shall be increased by the number of 3286
mills obtained by multiplying the number of mills of the 3287
original reduction by the same percentage that the financing 3288
district tax rate is decreased. If the county school financing 3289
district tax is repealed pursuant to an election under section 3290

Section 132:
5705.261 of the Revised Code, each school district may resume 3291
levying the property taxes that had been reduced at the full 3292
rate originally approved by the electors. A reduction in the 3293
rate of a school district property tax under this division is a 3294
reduction in the rate at which the board of education may levy 3295
that tax only for the period during which the county school 3296
H. B. No. 420 Page 112
As Introduced
financing district tax is levied prior to any decrease or repeal 3297
under section 5705.261 of the Revised Code. The resumption of 3298
the authority of the board of education to levy an increased or 3299
the full rate of tax does not constitute the levying of a new 3300
tax in excess of the ten-mill limitation. 3301
(F)(E) If a county school financing district has a tax in 3302
effect under this section, the territory of a city, local, or 3303
exempted village school district that is not a part of the 3304
county school financing district shall not become a part of the 3305
county school financing district unless approved by the electors 3306
of the city, local, or exempted village school district in 3307
accordance with division (C) of section 3311.50 of the Revised 3308
Code. 3309
Sec. 5705.217. (A) The board of education of a city, 3310
local, or exempted village school district, at any time by a 3311
vote of two-thirds of all its members, may declare by resolution 3312
that the amount of taxes that can be raised within the ten-mill 3313
limitation will be insufficient to provide an adequate amount 3314
for the present and future requirements of the school district; 3315
that it is necessary to levy an additional tax in excess of that 3316
limitation for the purposes of providing funds for current 3317
operating expenses and for general permanent improvements as 3318

5748.09 be amended and section 5705.171 of the Revised Code be 21
enacted to read as follows: 22
Sec. 505.37. (A) The board of township trustees may 23
establish all necessary rules to guard against the occurrence of 24
fires and to protect the property and lives of the citizens 25
against damage and accidents, and may purchase, lease, lease 26
with an option to purchase, or otherwise provide any fire 27
apparatus, mechanical resuscitators, underwater rescue and 28
recovery equipment, or other fire equipment, appliances, 29
materials, fire hydrants, and water supply for fire-fighting and 30
fire and rescue purposes that seems advisable to the board. The 31
board shall provide for the care and maintenance of such fire 32
equipment, and, for these purposes, may purchase, lease, lease 33
with an option to purchase, or construct and maintain necessary 34
buildings, and it may establish and maintain lines of fire-alarm 35
communications within the limits of the township. The board may 36
employ one or more persons to maintain and operate such fire 37
equipment, or it may enter into an agreement with a volunteer 38
fire company for the use and operation of the equipment. The 39
board may compensate the members of a volunteer fire company on 40
any basis and in any amount that it considers equitable. 41
When the estimated cost to purchase fire apparatus, 42
mechanical resuscitators, underwater rescue and recovery 43
equipment, or other fire equipment, appliances, materials, fire 44
hydrants, buildings, or fire-alarm communications equipment or 45
services exceeds the amount specified in section 9.17 of the 46
Revised Code, the contract shall be let by competitive bidding. 47
No purchase or other transaction subject to this section shall 48
be divided into component parts in order to avoid the 49
requirements of this section. When competitive bidding is 50
required, the board shall advertise once a week for not less 51

the levy for that year. Each issue of notes shall be sold as 506
provided in Chapter 133. of the Revised Code, and shall, except 507
for such limitation that the total amount of such notes maturing 508
in any one year shall not exceed fifty per cent of the 509
anticipated proceeds of the levy for that year, mature serially 510
in substantially equal installments, during each year over a 511
period not to exceed five years after their issuance. 512
(B) Prior to the application of section 319.301 of the 513
Revised Code, the rate of a levy that is limited to, or to the 514
extent that it is apportioned to, purposes other than current 515
expenses shall be reduced in the same proportion in which the 516
district's total valuation increases during the life of the levy 517
because of additions to such valuation that have resulted from 518
improvements added to the tax list and duplicate. 519
(C) The form of ballot cast at an election under division 520

district consisting of the following territory: 525
(a) The territory that constitutes the educational service 526
center on the date that the governing board of that educational 527
service center adopts a resolution under division (B) of this 528
section declaring that the territory of the educational service 529
center is a county school financing district, exclusive of any 530

H. B. No. 420 Page 19
As Introduced
territory subsequently withdrawn from the district under 531
division (D) of this section; 532
(b) Any territory that has been added to the county school 533
financing district under this section. 534
A county school financing district may include the 535
territory of a city, local, or exempted village school district 536
whose territory also is included in the territory of one or more 537
other county school financing districts. 538
(2) "The county auditor's appraised value" and "effective 539
rate" have the same meanings as in section 5705.01 of the 540
Revised Code. 541
(B) The governing board of any educational service center 542
may, by resolution, declare that the territory of the 543
educational service center is a county school financing 544
district. The resolution shall state the purpose for which the 545
county school financing district is created, which may be for 546
any one or more of the following purposes: 547
(1) To levy taxes for the provision of special education 548
by the school districts that are a part of the district, 549
including taxes for permanent improvements for special 550
education; 551
(2) To levy taxes for the provision of specified 552
educational programs and services by the school districts that 553
are a part of the district, as identified in the resolution 554
creating the district, including the levying of taxes for 555
permanent improvements for those programs and services. Services 556
financed by the levy may include school safety and security and 557
mental health services, including training and employment of or 558
contracting for the services of safety personnel, mental health 559

H. B. No. 420 Page 20
As Introduced
personnel, social workers, and counselors. 560
(3) To levy taxes for permanent improvements of school 561
districts that are a part of the district. 562
The governing board of the educational service center that 563
creates a county school financing district shall serve as the 564
taxing authority of the district and may use educational service 565
center governing board employees to perform any of the functions 566
necessary in the performance of its duties as a taxing 567
authority. A county school financing district shall not employ 568
any personnel. 569
With the approval of a majority of the members of the 570
board of education of each school district within the territory 571
of the county school financing district, the taxing authority of 572
the financing district may amend the resolution creating the 573
district to broaden or narrow the purposes for which it was 574
created. 575
A governing board of an educational service center may 576
create more than one county school financing district. If a 577
governing board of an educational service center creates more 578
than one such district, it shall clearly distinguish among the 579
districts it creates by including a designation of each 580
district's purpose in the district's name. 581
(C) A majority of the members of a board of education of a 582
city, local, or exempted village school district may adopt a 583
resolution requesting that its territory be joined with the 584
territory of any county school financing district. Copies of the 585
resolution shall be filed with the state board of education and 586
the taxing authority of the county school financing district. 587
Within sixty days of its receipt of such a resolution, the 588

H. B. No. 420 Page 21
As Introduced
county school financing district's taxing authority shall vote 589
on the question of whether to accept the school district's 590
territory as part of the county school financing district. If a 591
majority of the members of the taxing authority vote to accept 592
the territory, the school district's territory shall thereupon 593
become a part of the county school financing district unless the 594
county school financing district has in effect a tax imposed 595
under section 5705.215 of the Revised Code. If the county school 596
financing district has such a tax in effect, the taxing 597
authority shall certify a copy of its resolution accepting the 598
school district's territory to the school district's board of 599
education. The board of education and the county auditor shall 600
proceed in the same manner as required for a tax levy under 601
section 5705.03 of the Revised Code, except that the levy's 602
annual collections shall be estimated assuming that the school 603
district's territory has been added to the county school 604
financing district. After receipt of the auditor's certification 605
under that section, the board may adopt a resolution, with the 606
affirmative vote of a majority of its members, proposing the 607
submission to the electors of the question of whether the 608
district's territory shall become a part of the county school 609
financing district and subject to the taxes imposed by the 610
financing district. The resolution shall set forth the date on 611
which the question shall be submitted to the electors, which 612
shall be at a special election held on a date specified in the 613
resolution, which shall not be earlier than ninety days after 614
the adoption and certification of the resolution. A copy of the 615
resolution shall immediately be certified to the board of 616
elections of the proper county, which shall make arrangements 617
for the submission of the proposal to the electors of the school 618
district. The board of the joining district shall publish notice 619
of the election in a newspaper of general circulation in the 620

county once a week for two consecutive weeks, or as provided in 621
section 7.16 of the Revised Code, prior to the election. 622
Additionally, if the board of elections operates and maintains a 623
web site, the board of elections shall post notice of the 624
election on its web site for thirty days prior to the election. 625
The question appearing on the ballot shall read: 626
"Shall the territory within __________ (name of the school 627
district proposing to join the county school financing district) 628
__________ be added to __________ (name) __________ county 629
school financing district, and a property tax for the purposes 630
of _________ (here insert purposes), that the county auditor 631
estimates will collect $_____ annually, __________ at a rate not 632
exceeding __________ mills for each $1 of taxable value, which 633
amounts to $__________ (effective rate) for each $100,000 of the 634
county auditor's appraised value, ___________ be in effect for 635
__________ (here insert the number of years the tax is to be in 636
effect or "a continuing period of time," as applicable) 637
__________?" 638
If the proposal is approved by a majority of the electors 639
voting on it, the joinder shall take effect on the first day of 640
July following the date of the election, and the county board of 641
elections shall notify the county auditor of each county in 642
which the school district joining its territory to the county 643
school financing district is located. 644
(D) The board of any city, local, or exempted village 645
school district whose territory is part of a county school 646
financing district may withdraw its territory from the county 647
school financing district thirty days after submitting to the 648
governing board that is the taxing authority of the district and 649
the state board a resolution proclaiming such withdrawal, 650

As Introduced
adopted by a majority vote of its members, but any county school 651
financing district tax levied in such territory on the effective 652
date of the withdrawal shall remain in effect in such territory 653
until such tax expires or is renewed. No board may adopt a 654
resolution withdrawing from a county school financing district 655
that would take effect during the forty-five days preceding the 656
date of an election at which a levy proposed under section 657
5705.215 of the Revised Code is to be voted upon. 658
(E) A city, local, or exempted village school district 659
does not lose its separate identity or legal existence by reason 660
of joining its territory to a county school financing district 661
under this section and an educational service center does not 662
lose its separate identity or legal existence by reason of 663
creating a county school financing district that accepts or 664
loses territory under this section. 665
Sec. 3318.05. For purposes of this section, "conditional 666
approval" includes any conditional approval made by the Ohio 667
facilities commission and approved by the controlling board in 668
calendar year 2023. 669
The conditional approval of the Ohio facilities 670
construction commission for a project shall lapse and the amount 671
reserved and encumbered for such project shall be released 672
unless the school district board accepts such conditional 673
approval within one hundred twenty days following the date of 674
certification of the conditional approval to the school district 675
board and the electors of the school district vote favorably on 676
both of the propositions described in divisions (A) and (B) of 677

propositions described in divisions (A) and (B) of this section 682
shall be combined in a single proposal. If the district board or 683
the district's electors fail to meet such requirements and the 684
amount reserved and encumbered for the district's project is 685
released, the district shall be given first priority for project 686
funding as such funds become available, subject to section 687
3318.054 of the Revised Code. 688

division (J) of section 133.06 of the Revised Code and dedicated 694
by the school district board to payment of the district's 695
portion of the basic project cost; and 696
(B) On the question of levying a tax the proceeds of which 697
shall be used to pay the cost of maintaining or upgrading the 698
classroom facilities included in the project. Such tax shall be 699
at the rate of not less than one-half mill for each dollar of 700
valuation for a period of twenty-three years, subject to any 701
extension approved under section 3318.061 of the Revised Code. 702
(C) If a school district has in place a tax levied under 703
section 5705.21 of the Revised Code for general permanent 704
improvements for a continuing period of time and the proceeds of 705
such tax can be used for maintenance or upgrades, or if a 706
district agrees to the transfers described in section 3318.051 707
of the Revised Code, the school district need not levy the 708
additional tax required under division (B) of this section, 709

only so long as the electors of the district have approved, in 722
accordance with section 3318.063 of the Revised Code, the levy 723
of a tax for the maintenance or upgrades of the classroom 724
facilities acquired under the district's project and that levy 725

purpose. 732
(E) Proceeds of the tax to be used for maintenance or 733
upgrades of the classroom facilities under either division (B) 734
or (C)(1) of this section shall not be used to upgrade classroom 735

may be issued as general obligation securities or issued in 805
anticipation of a school district income tax or as property tax 806
anticipation notes under section 133.24 of the Revised Code. The 807
district board's resolution authorizing the issuance and sale of 808

board while those securities are outstanding, the school 836
district board shall continue to levy and collect the tax under 837
the authority of the original election authorizing the tax at a 838

district income tax that amount shall be rounded up to the 842
nearest one-fourth of one per cent. 843

sections 3318.40 to 3318.45 of the Revised Code, if the school 863
district board of education and the school district electors 864
have satisfied the conditions prescribed in division (D)(1) of 865
section 3318.41 of the Revised Code, the commission shall enter 866
into an agreement with the school district board for the 867
construction and sale of the project. In either case, the 868
agreement shall include, but need not be limited to, the 869
following provisions: 870
(A) The sale and issuance of bonds or notes in 871
anticipation thereof, as soon as practicable after the execution 872
of the agreement, in an amount equal to the school district's 873
portion of the basic project cost, including any securities 874
authorized under division (J) of section 133.06 of the Revised 875
Code and dedicated by the school district board to payment of 876
the district's portion of the basic project cost of the project; 877
provided, that if at that time the county treasurer of each 878
county in which the school district is located has not commenced 879
the collection of taxes on the general duplicate of real and 880
public utility property for the year in which the controlling 881
board approved the project, the school district board shall 882
authorize the issuance of a first installment of bond 883
anticipation notes in an amount specified by the agreement, 884
which amount shall not exceed an amount necessary to raise the 885
net bonded indebtedness of the school district as of the date of 886
the controlling board's approval to within five thousand dollars 887
of the required level of indebtedness for the preceding year. In 888
the event that a first installment of bond anticipation notes is 889
issued, the school district board shall, as soon as practicable 890
after the county treasurer of each county in which the school 891
district is located has commenced the collection of taxes on the 892
general duplicate of real and public utility property for the 893

year in which the controlling board approved the project, 894
authorize the issuance of a second and final installment of bond 895
anticipation notes or a first and final issue of bonds. 896
The combined value of the first and second installment of 897
bond anticipation notes or the value of the first and final 898
issue of bonds shall be equal to the school district's portion 899
of the basic project cost. The proceeds of any such bonds shall 900
be used first to retire any bond anticipation notes. Otherwise, 901
the proceeds of such bonds and of any bond anticipation notes, 902
except the premium and accrued interest thereon, shall be 903
deposited in the school district's project construction fund. In 904
determining the amount of net bonded indebtedness for the 905
purpose of fixing the amount of an issue of either bonds or bond 906
anticipation notes, gross indebtedness shall be reduced by 907
moneys in the bond retirement fund only to the extent of the 908
moneys therein on the first day of the year preceding the year 909
in which the controlling board approved the project. Should 910
there be a decrease in the tax valuation of the school district 911
so that the amount of indebtedness that can be incurred on the 912
tax duplicates for the year in which the controlling board 913
approved the project is less than the amount of the first 914
installment of bond anticipation notes, there shall be paid from 915
the school district's project construction fund to the school 916
district's bond retirement fund to be applied against such notes 917
an amount sufficient to cause the net bonded indebtedness of the 918
school district, as of the first day of the year following the 919
year in which the controlling board approved the project, to be 920
within five thousand dollars of the required level of 921
indebtedness for the year in which the controlling board 922
approved the project. The maximum amount of indebtedness to be 923
incurred by any school district board as its share of the cost 924

of the project is either an amount that will cause its net 925
bonded indebtedness, as of the first day of the year following 926
the year in which the controlling board approved the project, to 927
be within five thousand dollars of the required level of 928
indebtedness, or an amount equal to the required percentage of 929
the basic project costs, whichever is greater. All bonds and 930
bond anticipation notes shall be issued in accordance with 931
Chapter 133. of the Revised Code, and notes may be renewed as 932
provided in section 133.22 of the Revised Code. 933
(B) The transfer of such funds of the school district 934
board available for the project, together with the proceeds of 935
the sale of the bonds or notes, except premium, accrued 936
interest, and interest included in the amount of the issue, to 937
the school district's project construction fund; 938
(C) For all school districts except joint vocational 939
school districts that receive assistance under sections 3318.40 940
to 3318.45 of the Revised Code, the following provisions as 941
applicable: 942
(1) If section 3318.052 of the Revised Code applies, the 943
earmarking of the proceeds of a tax levied under section 5705.21 944
of the Revised Code for general permanent improvements or under 945
section 5705.218 of the Revised Code for the purpose of 946
permanent improvements, or the proceeds of a school district 947

upon certification to the board of elections not less than 1270
ninety days prior to the election, the boards of elections of 1271
the county or counties comprising such district shall place upon 1272

a tax on all the taxable property in the community college 1274
district outside the ten-mill limitation, for a specified period 1275

more than two special elections shall be held in any one 1284
calendar year. Levies for a continuing period of time adopted 1285
under this section may be reduced in accordance with section 1286
5705.261 of the Revised Code. 1287
If such proposal is to be or include the renewal of an 1288
existing levy at the expiration thereof, the ballot for such 1289
election shall state whether it is a renewal of a tax; a renewal 1290
of a stated number of mills and an increase of a stated number 1291

levy will first be made, which may include the tax duplicate for 1296
the current year unless the election is to be held after the 1297
first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of the current 1298
tax year. The ballot shall also state the period of years for 1299
such levy or that it is for a continuing period of time. If a 1300
levy for a continuing period of time provides for but is not 1301
limited to current expenses, the resolution of the board of 1302
trustees providing for the election on such levy shall apportion 1303
the annual rate of the levy between current expenses and the 1304
other purpose or purposes. Such apportionment need not be the 1305
same for each year of the levy, but the respective portions of 1306
the rate actually levied each year for current expenses and the 1307
other purpose or purposes shall be limited by such 1308
apportionment. The portion of the rate apportioned to the other 1309
purpose or purposes shall be reduced as provided in division (B) 1310
of this section. 1311

two consecutive weeks, or as provided in section 7.16 of the 1326
Revised Code, prior to the election at which the question is to 1327
appear on the ballot. If a board of elections operates and 1328
maintains a web site, that board also shall post the 1329
advertisement on its web site for thirty days prior to that 1330
election. 1331
After the approval of such levy by vote, the board of 1332
trustees of a community college district may anticipate a 1333
fraction of the proceeds of such levy and from time to time 1334
issue anticipation notes having such maturity or maturities that 1335
the aggregate principal amount of all such notes maturing in any 1336
calendar year shall not exceed seventy-five per cent of the 1337
anticipated proceeds from such levy for such year, and that no 1338
note shall mature later than the thirty-first day of December of 1339

funds of the community college district or by other persons, and 1348
the community college district may restore and repay to such 1349
funds or persons from the proceeds of such issues the moneys so 1350
borrowed, advanced or granted. 1351

Revised Code, the rate of a levy that is limited to, or to the 1360

The question covered by the resolution shall be submitted 2199
as a separate proposition, but may be printed on the same ballot 2200

be submitted at the same election. 2203
(D) Two or more existing levies, or any portion of those 2204
levies, may be combined into one replacement levy, so long as 2205
all of the existing levies are for the same purpose and either 2206
all are due to expire the same year or all are for a continuing 2207
period of time. The question of combining all or portions of 2208
those existing levies into the replacement levy shall appear as 2209
one ballot proposition before the electors. If the electors 2210
approve the ballot proposition, all or the stated portions of 2211
the existing levies are replaced by one replacement levy. 2212
(E) A levy approved in excess of the ten-mill limitation 2213

In the first year of a levy approved under this section, the 2215
levy shall be extended on the tax lists after the February 2216
settlement succeeding the election at which the levy was 2217
approved. If the levy is to be placed on the tax lists of the 2218
current year, as specified in the resolution providing for its 2219

county budget commission. 2226
If notes are authorized to be issued in anticipation of 2227
the proceeds of the existing levy, notes may be issued in 2228
anticipation of the proceeds of the replacement levy, and such 2229
issuance is subject to the terms and limitations governing the 2230
issuance of notes in anticipation of the proceeds of the 2231
existing levy. 2232
(F) This section does not authorize a tax to be levied in 2233

Sec. 5705.198. The taxing authority of a joint recreation 2236
district may levy a tax approved by the electors for the purpose 2237
stated in division (H) of section 5705.19 of the Revised Code 2238
and for a continuing period of time for any specified number of 2239
years, and in accordance with that section. After the approval 2240
at any time of a levy for that purpose by vote, the taxing 2241
authority of a joint recreation district may anticipate a 2242
fraction of the proceeds of that levy and, from time to time 2243
during the life of the levy, issue anticipation notes. The 2244
aggregate principal payments on all such anticipation notes to 2245
be made in any calendar year shall not exceed fifty per cent of 2246
the anticipated proceeds from the levy for that year, and no 2247
anticipation note shall mature later than the thirty-first day 2248

members, may declare by resolution that the revenue that will be 2255
raised by all tax levies that the district is authorized to 2256
impose, when combined with state and federal revenues, will be 2257
insufficient to provide for the necessary requirements of the 2258
school district, and that it is therefore necessary to levy a 2259
tax in excess of the ten-mill limitation for the purpose of 2260
providing for the necessary requirements of the school district. 2261
Such a levy shall be proposed as a substitute for all or a 2262
portion of one or more existing levies imposed under sections 2263

by levying a tax as follows: 2265
(1) In the initial year the levy is in effect, the levy 2266
shall be in a specified amount of money equal to the aggregate 2267
annual dollar amount of proceeds derived from the levy or 2268
levies, or portion thereof, being substituted. 2269
(2) In each subsequent year the levy is in effect, the 2270
levy shall be in a specified amount of money equal to the sum of 2271
the following: 2272
(a) The dollar amount of the proceeds derived from the 2273
levy in the prior year; and 2274
(b) The dollar amount equal to the product of the total 2275
taxable value of all taxable real property in the school 2276
district in the then-current year, excluding carryover property 2277

amount of the levy under this section in the prior year; 2281
provided, that the amount under division (A)(2)(b) of this 2282

specify the annual dollar amount the levy is to produce in its 2285
initial year; the first calendar year in which the levy will be 2286
due; and the term of the levy expressed in years, which may be 2287
any number not exceeding ten, or for a continuing period of 2288
time. The resolution shall specify the date of holding the 2289
election, which shall not be earlier than ninety days after 2290
certification of the resolution to the board of elections, and 2291

to be included in a single substitute levy, but are not 2294
scheduled to expire in the same year, the resolution shall 2295
specify that the existing levies to be substituted shall not be 2296
levied after the year preceding the year in which the substitute 2297
levy is first imposed. 2298
The resolution shall go into immediate effect upon its 2299
passage, and no publication of the resolution shall be necessary 2300
other than that provided for in the notice of election. A copy 2301

5705.196 of the Revised Code shall govern the arrangements for 2305
the submission of the question and other matters concerning the 2306
notice of election and the election, except as may be provided 2307
otherwise in this section. 2308
(C) The form of the ballot to be used at the election on 2309
the question of a levy under this section shall be as follows: 2310

levies to be substituted and that none of the existing levies to 2333
be substituted will be levied after the year preceding the year 2334
in which the substitute levy is first imposed. The form of the 2335

budget that is certified to the county budget commission. 2354
(F) A levy for a continuing period of time may be 2355
decreased pursuant to section 5705.261 of the Revised Code. 2356

shall be treated as having renewed the levy or levies being 2360
substituted for purposes of the payments made under sections 2361
5751.20 to 5751.22 of the Revised Code. 2362
(H) (G) After the approval of a levy on the current tax 2363

5705.19 of the Revised Code, the resolution may propose to renew 2616
one or more of those existing levies, or to increase or decrease 2617
a single such existing levy, for the purpose of general 2618
permanent improvements. 2619
If the resolution proposes to renew two or more existing 2620
levies, the levies shall be levied for the same purpose. The 2621
resolution shall identify those levies and the rates at which 2622
they are levied. The resolution also shall specify that the 2623
existing levies shall not be extended on the tax lists after the 2624
year preceding the year in which the renewal levy is first 2625
imposed, regardless of the years for which those levies 2626
originally were authorized to be levied. 2627
If the resolution proposes to renew an existing levy 2628
imposed under division (B) of this section, the rates allocated 2629
to the qualifying school district and to partnering community 2630
schools each may be increased or decreased or remain the same, 2631

(F) The board of education of any school district that 2726
levies a tax under this section for the purpose of providing for 2727
school safety and security may report to the department of 2728
education how the district is using revenue from that tax. 2729
The board of education of any school district that 2730
proposes to levy a tax for the purpose of providing for school 2731
safety and security may share the proceeds of the tax with 2732
chartered nonpublic schools, as defined by section 3310.01 of 2733
the Revised Code, that are located in the territory of the 2734
school district as provided in this division. The resolution 2735
levying the tax and the form of the ballot shall state that 2736
proceeds from the levy are to be shared with chartered nonpublic 2737
schools and shall state the percentage of the proceeds that is 2738
to be shared with those schools. 2739
If a percentage of the proceeds of such a tax are to be 2740
shared with chartered nonpublic schools under this division, 2741
such proceeds shall be shared with all chartered nonpublic 2742
schools located in the territory of the school district. Of the 2743
percentage of the proceeds to be shared with chartered nonpublic 2744
schools, each such school shall receive an amount that bears the 2745
same proportion of that percentage that the number of resident 2746
students attending that school bears to the total number of 2747
resident students attending all such schools in the territory of 2748
the school district. For the purposes of this section, a 2749
resident student is a student enrolled in a chartered nonpublic 2750
school located in the territory of the school district who is 2751
entitled to attend school in the school district under section 2752
3313.64 or 3313.65 of the Revised Code. 2753

the proceeds from that fund not less frequently than once after 2757
each settlement of taxes under divisions (A) and (C) of section 2758
321.24 of the Revised Code. Any chartered nonpublic school 2759
receiving payments under this section shall use all of such 2760
payments only for providing for school safety and security. 2761
Sec. 5705.212. (A)(1) The board of education of any school 2762
district, at any time and by a vote of two-thirds of all of its 2763
members, may declare by resolution that the amount of taxes that 2764
may be raised within the ten-mill limitation will be 2765
insufficient to provide an adequate amount for the present and 2766
future requirements of the school district, that it is necessary 2767
to levy not more than five taxes in excess of that limitation 2768
for current expenses, and that each of the proposed taxes first 2769
will be levied in a different year, over a specified period of 2770
time. The board shall identify the taxes proposed under this 2771
section as follows: the first tax to be levied shall be called 2772
the "original tax." Each tax subsequently levied shall be called 2773
an "incremental tax." The rate of each incremental tax shall be 2774
identical, but the rates of such incremental taxes need not be 2775
the same as the rate of the original tax. The resolution also 2776
shall state that the question of these additional taxes shall be 2777
submitted to the electors of the school district at a special 2778
election. The resolution shall specify separately for each tax 2779
proposed: the amount of the increase in rate that it is 2780
necessary to levy, expressed separately for the original tax and 2781
each incremental tax; that the purpose of the levy is for 2782
current expenses; the number of years during which the original 2783
tax shall be in effect; a specification that the last year in 2784
which the original tax is in effect shall also be the last year 2785
in which each incremental tax shall be in effect; and the year 2786

H. B. No. 420 Page 95
As Introduced
in which each tax first is proposed to be levied. The original 2787
tax may be levied for any number of years not exceeding ten, or 2788
for a continuing period of time. The resolution shall specify 2789
the date of holding the special election, which shall not be 2790
earlier than ninety days after the adoption and certification of 2791
the resolution and shall be consistent with the requirements of 2792
section 3501.01 of the Revised Code. 2793
(2) The board of education, by a vote of two-thirds of all 2794
of its members, may adopt a resolution proposing to renew taxes 2795
levied other than for a continuing period of time under division 2796
(A)(1) of this section. Such a resolution shall provide for 2797
levying a tax and specify all of the following: 2798
(a) That the tax shall be called and designated on the 2799
ballot as a renewal levy; 2800
(b) The rate of the renewal tax, which shall be a single 2801
rate that combines the rate of the original tax and each 2802
incremental tax into a single rate. The rate of the renewal tax 2803
shall not exceed the aggregate rate of the original and 2804
incremental taxes. 2805
(c) The number of years, not to exceed ten, that the 2806
renewal tax will be levied, or that it will be levied for a 2807
continuing period of time; 2808
(d) That the purpose of the renewal levy is for current 2809
expenses; 2810
(e) Subject to the certification and notification 2811
requirements of section 5705.251 of the Revised Code, that the 2812
question of the renewal levy shall be submitted to the electors 2813

election held during the ensuing year. 2817
(3) A resolution adopted under division (A)(1) or (2) of 2818
this section shall go into immediate effect upon its adoption 2819
and no publication of the resolution is necessary other than 2820
that provided for in the notice of election. Immediately after 2821
its adoption, a copy of the resolution shall be certified to the 2822
board of elections of the proper county in the manner provided 2823
by division (A) of section 5705.251 of the Revised Code, and 2824
that division shall govern the arrangements for the submission 2825
of the question and other matters concerning the election to 2826
which that section refers. The election shall be held on the 2827
date specified in the resolution. If a majority of the electors 2828
voting on the question so submitted in an election vote in favor 2829
of the taxes or a renewal tax, the board of education, if the 2830
original or a renewal tax is authorized to be levied for the 2831
current year, immediately may make the necessary levy within the 2832
school district at the authorized rate, or at any lesser rate in 2833
excess of the ten-mill limitation, for the purpose stated in the 2834
resolution. No tax shall be imposed prior to the year specified 2835
in the resolution as the year in which it is first proposed to 2836
be levied. The rate of the original tax and the rate of each 2837
incremental tax shall be cumulative, so that the aggregate rate 2838
levied in any year is the sum of the rates of both the original 2839
tax and all incremental taxes levied in or prior to that year 2840
under the same proposal. A tax levied for a continuing period of 2841
time under this section may be reduced pursuant to section 2842
5705.261 of the Revised Code. 2843
(B) Notwithstanding section 133.30 of the Revised Code, 2844

may anticipate a fraction of the proceeds of the levy and issue 2848
anticipation notes in an amount not to exceed fifty per cent of 2849
the total estimated proceeds of the levy to be collected during 2850
the first year of the levy. The notes shall be sold as provided 2851
in Chapter 133. of the Revised Code. If anticipation notes are 2852
issued, they shall mature serially and in substantially equal 2853
amounts during each year over a period not to exceed five years; 2854
and the amount necessary to pay the interest and principal as 2855
the anticipation notes mature shall be deemed appropriated for 2856
those purposes from the levy, and appropriations from the levy 2857
by the board of education shall be limited each fiscal year to 2858
the balance available in excess of that amount. 2859
If the auditor of state has certified a deficit pursuant 2860
to section 3313.483 of the Revised Code, the notes authorized 2861
under this section may be sold in accordance with Chapter 133. 2862

(C)(1) The board of education of a qualifying school 2866
district, at any time and by a vote of two-thirds of all its 2867
members, may declare by resolution that it is necessary to levy 2868
not more than five taxes in excess of the ten-mill limitation 2869
for the current expenses of partnering community schools and, if 2870
any of the levy proceeds are so allocated, of the school 2871
district, and that each of the proposed taxes first will be 2872
levied in a different year, over a specified period of time. A 2873
qualifying school district that is not a municipal school 2874
district may allocate all of the levy proceeds to partnering 2875
community schools. A municipal school district shall allocate a 2876
portion of the levy proceeds to the current expenses of the 2877

division in the same manner as in division (A)(1) of this 2879
section. The rate of each incremental tax shall be identical, 2880
but the rates of such incremental taxes need not be the same as 2881
the rate of the original tax. In addition to the specifications 2882
required of the resolution in division (A) of this section, the 2883
resolution shall state the number of the mills to be levied each 2884
year for the current expenses of the partnering community 2885
schools and the number of the mills, if any, to be levied each 2886
year for the current expenses of the school district. The number 2887
of mills for the current expenses of partnering community 2888
schools shall be the same for each of the incremental taxes, and 2889
the number of mills for the current expenses of the qualifying 2890
school district shall be the same for each of the incremental 2891
taxes. 2892
The levy of taxes for the current expenses of a partnering 2893

distribution of proceeds from the tax by a qualifying school 2895
district to partnering community schools is hereby determined to 2896

allocated to the qualifying school district and to partnering 2902
community schools each may be increased or decreased or remain 2903
the same, and the total rate may be increased, decreased, or 2904

qualifying school district and issue anticipation notes in a 2924
principal amount not exceeding fifty per cent of the estimated 2925

certified by the county auditor under division (A) of section 3032
319.28 of the Revised Code. 3033
If the board desires to proceed with the submission of the 3034
question, it shall certify its resolution, with the estimated 3035
tax levy expressed in mills for each one dollar of taxable value 3036
and dollars for each one hundred thousand dollars of the county 3037
auditor's appraised value for each year that the tax is proposed 3038
to be in effect, to the board of elections of the proper county 3039
in the manner provided by division (A) of section 5705.251 of 3040
the Revised Code. Section 5705.251 of the Revised Code shall 3041
govern the arrangements for the submission of the question and 3042
other matters concerning the election to which that section 3043
refers. The election shall be held on the date specified in the 3044
resolution. If a majority of the electors voting on the question 3045
so submitted in an election vote in favor of the tax, and if the 3046
tax is authorized to be levied for the current year, the board 3047
of education immediately may make the additional levy necessary 3048
to raise the amount specified in the resolution or a lesser 3049
amount for the purpose stated in the resolution. 3050
(4) The submission of questions to the electors under this 3051
section is subject to the limitation on the number of election 3052
dates established by section 5705.214 of the Revised Code. 3053
(B) Notwithstanding section 133.30 of the Revised Code, 3054
after the approval of a tax to be levied in the current or the 3055
succeeding year and prior to the time when the first tax 3056
collection from that levy can be made, the board of education 3057
may anticipate a fraction of the proceeds of the levy and issue 3058

H. B. No. 420 Page 104
As Introduced
anticipation notes in an amount not to exceed fifty per cent of 3059
the total estimated proceeds of the levy to be collected during 3060
the first year of the levy. The notes shall be sold as provided 3061
in Chapter 133. of the Revised Code. If anticipation notes are 3062
issued, they shall mature serially and in substantially equal 3063
amounts during each year over a period not to exceed five years; 3064
and the amount necessary to pay the interest and principal as 3065
the anticipation notes mature shall be deemed appropriated for 3066
those purposes from the levy, and appropriations from the levy 3067
by the board of education shall be limited each fiscal year to 3068
the balance available in excess of that amount. 3069
If the auditor of state has certified a deficit pursuant 3070
to section 3313.483 of the Revised Code, the notes authorized 3071
under this section may be sold in accordance with Chapter 133. 3072
of the Revised Code, except that the board may sell the notes 3073
after providing a reasonable opportunity for competitive 3074
bidding. 3075
Sec. 5705.215. (A) The governing board of an educational 3076
service center that is the taxing authority of a county school 3077
financing district, upon receipt of identical resolutions 3078
adopted within a sixty-day period by a majority of the members 3079
of the board of education of each school district that is within 3080
the territory of the county school financing district, may 3081
submit a tax levy to the electors of the territory in the same 3082
manner as a school board may submit a levy under division (C) of 3083
section 5705.21 of the Revised Code, except that: 3084
(1) The levy may be for a period not to exceed ten years, 3085
or, if the levy is solely for the purpose or purposes described 3086
in division (A)(2)(a), (c), or (f) of this section, for a 3087
continuing period of time. 3088

H. B. No. 420 Page 105
As Introduced
(2) The purpose of the levy shall be one or more of the 3089
following: 3090
(a) For current expenses for the provision of special 3091
education and related services within the territory of the 3092
district; 3093
(b) For permanent improvements within the territory of the 3094
district for special education and related services; 3095
(c) For current expenses for specified educational 3096
programs within the territory of the district; 3097
(d) For permanent improvements within the territory of the 3098
district for specified educational programs; 3099
(e) For permanent improvements within the territory of the 3100
district; 3101
(f) For current expenses for school safety and security 3102
and mental health services, including training and employment of 3103
or contracting for the services of safety personnel, mental 3104
health personnel, social workers, and counselors. 3105
(B) If the levy provides for but is not limited to current 3106
expenses, the resolutions shall apportion the annual rate of the 3107
levy between current expenses and the other purposes. The 3108
apportionment need not be the same for each year of the levy, 3109
but the respective portions of the rate actually levied each 3110
year for current expenses and the other purposes shall be 3111
limited by that apportionment. 3112
(C) Prior to the application of section 319.301 of the 3113
Revised Code, the rate of a levy that is limited to, or to the 3114
extent that it is apportioned to, purposes other than current 3115
expenses shall be reduced in the same proportion in which the 3116

H. B. No. 420 Page 106
As Introduced
district's total valuation increases during the life of the levy 3117
because of additions to such valuation that have resulted from 3118
improvements added to the tax list and duplicate. 3119
(D) After the approval of a county school financing 3120
district levy under this section, the taxing authority may 3121
anticipate a fraction of the proceeds of such levy and may from 3122
time to time during the life of such levy, but in any given year 3123
prior to the time when the tax collection from such levy can be 3124
made for that year, issue anticipation notes in an amount not 3125
exceeding fifty per cent of the estimated proceeds of the levy 3126
to be collected in each year up to a period of five years after 3127
the date of the issuance of such notes, less an amount equal to 3128
the proceeds of such levy obligated for each year by the 3129
issuance of anticipation notes, provided that the total amount 3130
maturing in any one year shall not exceed fifty per cent of the 3131
anticipated proceeds of the levy for that year. Each issue of 3132
notes shall be sold as provided in Chapter 133. of the Revised 3133
Code, and shall, except for the limitation that the total amount 3134
of such notes maturing in any one year shall not exceed fifty 3135
per cent of the anticipated proceeds of such levy for that year, 3136
mature serially in substantially equal installments during each 3137
year over a period not to exceed five years after their 3138
issuance. 3139
(E)(1) In a resolution to be submitted to the taxing 3140
authority of a county school financing district under division 3141
(A) of this section calling for a ballot issue on the question 3142
of the levying of a tax for a continuing period of time by the 3143
taxing authority, the board of education of a school district 3144
that is part of the territory of the county school financing 3145
district also may propose to reduce the rate of one or more of 3146
that school district's property taxes levied for a continuing 3147

H. B. No. 420 Page 107
As Introduced
period of time in excess of the ten-mill limitation. The 3148
reduction in the rate of a property tax may be any amount, not 3149
exceeding the rate at which the tax is authorized to be levied. 3150
The reduction in the rate of a tax shall first take effect in 3151
the same year that the county school financing district tax 3152
takes effect, and shall continue for each year that the county 3153
school financing district tax is in effect. A board of 3154
education's resolution proposing to reduce the rate of one or 3155
more of its school district property taxes shall, in addition to 3156
including information required for a resolution under division 3157
(B)(1) of section 5705.03 of the Revised Code, specifically 3158
identify each such tax and shall state for each tax the maximum 3159
rate at which it currently may be levied and the maximum rate at 3160
which it could be levied after the proposed reduction, expressed 3161
in mills for each one dollar of taxable value. 3162
Before submitting the resolution to the taxing authority 3163
of the county school financing district, the board of education 3164
of the school district shall certify a copy of it to the tax 3165
commissioner and the county auditor. The county auditor shall 3166
certify to the board all information required under division (B) 3167
(2) of section 5705.03 of the Revised Code, in the manner 3168
required under that division, and both of the following: 3169
(a) An estimate of the levy's annual collections beginning 3170
for the first year for which the reduction applies, rounded to 3171
the nearest dollar, which shall be calculated assuming that the 3172
amount of the tax list of the taxing authority remains 3173
throughout the life of the reduced levy the same as the amount 3174
of the tax list most recently certified by the county auditor 3175
under division (A) of section 319.28 of the Revised Code. 3176
If a school district is located in more than one county, 3177

H. B. No. 420 Page 108
As Introduced
the county auditor shall obtain from the county auditor of each 3178
other county in which the district is located the current tax 3179
valuation for the portion of the district in that county. 3180
(b) The effective rate of the levy for the last year 3181
before the proposed reduction and the first year that the 3182
reduction applies, both expressed in dollars for each one 3183
hundred thousand dollars of the county auditor's appraised 3184
value. 3185
The tax commissioner, within ten days of receiving the 3186
resolution, shall certify to the board the reduction in the 3187
school district's total effective tax rate for each class of 3188
property that would have resulted if the proposed reduction in 3189
the rate or rates had been in effect the previous year. As used 3190
in this paragraph, "effective tax rate" has the same meaning as 3191
in section 323.08 of the Revised Code. 3192
After receiving these certifications from the commissioner 3193
and the auditor, the board may amend its resolution to change 3194
the proposed property tax rate reduction before submitting the 3195
resolution to the financing district taxing authority, provided 3196
the board certifies a copy of the amended resolution to the 3197
county auditor with a request to provide the information 3198
required under divisions (E)(1)(a) and (b) of this section and 3199
the auditor transmits that information to the taxing authority. 3200
If the board of education of a school district that is 3201
part of the territory of a county school financing district 3202
adopts a resolution proposing to reduce the rate of one or more 3203
of its property taxes in conjunction with the levying of a tax 3204
by the financing district, the resolution submitted by the board 3205
to the taxing authority of the financing district under division 3206
(A) of this section does not have to be identical in this 3207

H. B. No. 420 Page 109

respect to the resolutions submitted by the boards of education 3208
of the other school districts that are part of the territory of 3209
the county school financing district. 3210
(2) Each school district that is part of the territory of 3211
a county school financing district may tailor to its own 3212
situation a proposed reduction in one or more property tax rates 3213
in conjunction with the proposed levying of a tax by the county 3214
school financing district; if one such school district proposes 3215
a reduction in one or more tax rates, another school district 3216
may propose a reduction of a different size or may propose no 3217
reduction. Within each school district that is part of the 3218
territory of the county school financing district, the electors 3219
shall vote on one ballot issue combining the question of the 3220
levying of the tax by the taxing authority of the county school 3221
financing district with, if any such reduction is proposed, the 3222
question of the reduction in the rate of one or more taxes of 3223
the school district. If a majority of the electors of the county 3224
school financing district voting on the question of the proposed 3225
levying of a tax by the taxing authority of the financing 3226
district vote to approve the question, any tax reductions 3227
proposed by school districts that are part of the territory of 3228
the financing district also are approved. 3229
(3) The form of the ballot for an issue proposing to levy 3230
a county school financing district tax in conjunction with the 3231
reduction of the rate of one or more school district taxes shall 3232
be as follows: 3233
"Shall the _______ (name of the county school financing 3234
district) be authorized to levy an additional tax for _______ 3235
(purpose stated in the resolutions), that the county auditor 3236
estimates will collect $_____ annually, at a rate not exceeding 3237

H. B. No. 420 Page 110

_______ mills for each $1 of taxable value, which amounts to 3238
$_______ for each $100,000 of the county auditor's appraised 3239
value, for a continuing period of time? If the county school 3240
financing district tax is approved, the rate of an existing tax 3241
currently levied by the _______ (name of the school district of 3242
which the elector is a resident) at the rate of _______ mills 3243
shall be reduced to _______ mills for each $1 of taxable value, 3244
which amounts to a reduction from $_______ (effective rate) to 3245
$_______ (effective rate) for each $100,000 of the county 3246
auditor's appraised value, that the county auditor estimates 3247
will collect $_____ annually, until any such time as the county 3248
school financing district tax is decreased or repealed. 3249

FOR THE TAX LEVY
"
AGAINST THE TAX LEVY
If the board of education of the school district proposes 3251
to reduce the rate of more than one of its existing taxes, the 3252
second sentence of the ballot language shall be modified for 3253
residents of that district to express the rates and effective 3254
rates at which those taxes currently are levied and the rates 3255
and effective rates to which they would be reduced as well as 3256
each levy's estimated annual collections, as provided by the 3257
county auditor under division (E)(1)(a) of this section. If the 3258
board of education of the school district does not propose to 3259
reduce the rate of any of its taxes, the second sentence of the 3260
ballot language shall not be used for residents of that 3261
district. In any case, the first sentence of the ballot language 3262
shall be the same for all the electors in the county school 3263
financing district, but the second sentence shall be different 3264
in each school district depending on whether and in what amount 3265

H. B. No. 420 Page 111
As Introduced
the board of education of the school district proposes to reduce 3266
the rate of one or more of its property taxes. 3267
(4) If the rate of a school district property tax is 3268
reduced pursuant to this division, the tax commissioner shall 3269
compute the percentage required to be computed for that tax 3270
under division (D) of section 319.301 of the Revised Code each 3271
year the rate is reduced as if the tax had been levied in the 3272
preceding year at the rate to which it has been reduced. If the 3273
reduced rate of a tax is increased under division (E)(5) of this 3274
section, the commissioner shall compute the percentage required 3275
to be computed for that tax under division (D) of section 3276
319.301 of the Revised Code each year the rate is increased as 3277
if the tax had been levied in the preceding year at the rate to 3278
which it has been increased. 3279
(5) After the levying of a county school financing 3280
district tax in conjunction with the reduction of the rate of 3281
one or more school district taxes is approved by the electors 3282
under this division, if the rate of the county school financing 3283
district tax is decreased pursuant to an election under section 3284
5705.261 of the Revised Code, the rate of each school district 3285
tax that had been reduced shall be increased by the number of 3286
mills obtained by multiplying the number of mills of the 3287
original reduction by the same percentage that the financing 3288
district tax rate is decreased. If the county school financing 3289
district tax is repealed pursuant to an election under section 3290
5705.261 of the Revised Code, each school district may resume 3291
levying the property taxes that had been reduced at the full 3292
rate originally approved by the electors. A reduction in the 3293
rate of a school district property tax under this division is a 3294
reduction in the rate at which the board of education may levy 3295
that tax only for the period during which the county school 3296

H. B. No. 420 Page 112
As Introduced
financing district tax is levied prior to any decrease or repeal 3297
under section 5705.261 of the Revised Code. The resumption of 3298
the authority of the board of education to levy an increased or 3299
the full rate of tax does not constitute the levying of a new 3300
tax in excess of the ten-mill limitation. 3301
(F)(E) If a county school financing district has a tax in 3302
effect under this section, the territory of a city, local, or 3303
exempted village school district that is not a part of the 3304
county school financing district shall not become a part of the 3305
county school financing district unless approved by the electors 3306
of the city, local, or exempted village school district in 3307
accordance with division (C) of section 3311.50 of the Revised 3308
Code. 3309
Sec. 5705.217. (A) The board of education of a city, 3310
local, or exempted village school district, at any time by a 3311
vote of two-thirds of all its members, may declare by resolution 3312
that the amount of taxes that can be raised within the ten-mill 3313
limitation will be insufficient to provide an adequate amount 3314
for the present and future requirements of the school district; 3315
that it is necessary to levy an additional tax in excess of that 3316
limitation for the purposes of providing funds for current 3317
operating expenses and for general permanent improvements as 3318
defined in section 5705.21 of the Revised Code; and that the 3319
question of the tax shall be submitted to the electors of the 3320
district at a special election. The tax may be levied for a 3321
specified number of years not exceeding five or for a continuing 3322
period of time. The resolution shall specify the proposed tax 3323
rate, the first year the tax will be levied, and the number of 3324
years it will be levied, or that it will be levied for a 3325
continuing period of time. The resolution shall apportion the 3326
annual rate of the tax between current operating expenses and 3327

H. B. No. 420 Page 113
As Introduced
permanent improvements. The apportionment may but need not be 3328
the same for each year of the tax, but the respective portions 3329
of the rate actually levied each year for current operating 3330
expenses and permanent improvements shall be limited by the 3331
apportionment. 3332
The resolution shall specify the date of holding the 3333
special election, which shall not be earlier than ninety days 3334
after certification of the resolution to the board of elections 3335
and shall be consistent with the requirements of section 3501.01 3336
of the Revised Code. The resolution shall go into immediate 3337
effect upon its passage, and no publication of it is necessary 3338
other than that provided in the notice of election. The board of 3339
education shall certify a copy of the resolution to the board of 3340
elections immediately after its adoption. Section 5705.25 of the 3341
Revised Code governs the arrangements and form of the ballot for 3342
the submission of the question to the electors. 3343
If a majority of the electors voting on the question vote 3344
in favor of the tax, the board of education may make the levy at 3345
the additional rate, or at any lesser rate in excess of the ten- 3346
mill limitation. If the tax is for a continuing period of time, 3347
it may be decreased in accordance with section 5705.261 of the 3348
Revised Code. 3349
A board of education may adopt a resolution to renew one 3350
or more existing levies imposed under this section, or to 3351
increase or decrease the rate of a tax levied under this 3352
section, for the purpose of providing funds for either current 3353
expenses and general permanent improvements or solely for 3354
general permanent improvements. 3355

of education may anticipate a fraction of the proceeds of such 3359
levy and issue anticipation notes in a principal amount not 3360
exceeding fifty per cent of the total estimated proceeds of the 3361
tax to be collected during the first year of the levy. 3362
(2) After the approval of a tax for general permanent 3363
improvements levied under this section for a specified number of 3364
years, the board of education may anticipate a fraction of the 3365
proceeds of such tax and issue anticipation notes in a principal 3366
amount not exceeding fifty per cent of the total estimated 3367
proceeds of the tax remaining to be collected in each year over 3368
a specified period of years, not exceeding the number of years 3369
for which the tax was levied, after issuance of the notes. 3370
(3) After the approval of a tax for general permanent 3371
improvements levied under this section for a continuing period 3372
of time, the board of education may anticipate a fraction of the 3373
proceeds of such tax and issue anticipation notes in a principal 3374
amount not exceeding fifty per cent of the total estimated 3375
proceeds of the tax to be collected in each year over a 3376
specified period of years, not exceeding ten, after issuance of 3377
the notes. No notes may be issued under this division on or 3378
after the effective date of this amendment. 3379
Anticipation notes under this section shall be issued as 3380
provided in section 133.24 of the Revised Code. Notes issued 3381
under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section shall have 3382
principal payments during each year after the year of their 3383
issuance over a period not to exceed five years, and may have a 3384
principal payment in the year of their issuance. Notes issued 3385

elections that can be held in a year under section 5705.214 of 3392
the Revised Code. 3393
Sec. 5705.218. (A) The board of education of a city, 3394
local, or exempted village school district, at any time by a 3395
vote of two-thirds of all its members, may declare by resolution 3396
that it may be necessary for the school district to issue 3397
general obligation bonds for permanent improvements. The 3398
resolution shall state all of the following: 3399
(1) The necessity and purpose of the bond issue; 3400
(2) The date of the special election at which the question 3401
shall be submitted to the electors; 3402
(3) The amount, approximate date, estimated rate of 3403
interest, and maximum number of years over which the principal 3404
of the bonds may be paid; 3405
(4) The necessity of levying a tax outside the ten-mill 3406
limitation to pay debt charges on the bonds and any anticipatory 3407
securities. 3408
On adoption of the resolution, the board shall certify a 3409
copy of it to the county auditor. The county auditor promptly 3410
shall estimate and certify to the board the average annual 3411
property tax rate, expressed in mills for each one dollar of 3412
taxable value and in dollars for each one hundred thousand 3413
dollars of the county auditor's appraised value, required 3414

the amount of taxes that can be raised within the ten-mill 3422
limitation will be insufficient to provide an adequate amount 3423

that it is necessary to issue general obligation bonds of the 3425
school district for permanent improvements and to levy an 3426
additional tax in excess of the ten-mill limitation to pay debt 3427
charges on the bonds and any anticipatory securities; that it is 3428
necessary for a specified number of years or for a continuing 3429
period of time to levy additional taxes in excess of the ten- 3430
mill limitation to provide funds for the acquisition, 3431
construction, enlargement, renovation, and financing of 3432
permanent improvements or to pay for current operating expenses, 3433

shall be certified to the tax commissioner no later than one 4697
hundred days prior to the date of the election at which the 4698
board intends to propose a levy under this section. Upon receipt 4699
of the copy of the resolution, the tax commissioner shall 4700
estimate both of the following: 4701
(1) The property tax rate that would have to be imposed in 4702
the current year by the district to produce an equivalent amount 4703
of money; 4704
(2) The income tax rate that would have had to have been 4705
in effect for the current year to produce an equivalent amount 4706
of money from a school district income tax. 4707
Within ten days of receiving the copy of the board's 4708
resolution, the commissioner shall prepare these estimates and 4709
certify them to the board. Upon receipt of the certification, 4710
the board may adopt a resolution proposing an income tax under 4711
division (B) of this section at the estimated rate contained in 4712
the certification rounded to the nearest one-fourth of one per 4713
cent. The commissioner's certification applies only to the 4714
board's proposal to levy an income tax at the election for which 4715
the board requested the certification. If the board intends to 4716
submit a proposal to levy an income tax at any other election, 4717
it shall request another certification for that election in the 4718
manner prescribed in this division. 4719
(B)(1)(B) Upon the receipt of a certification from the tax 4720
commissioner under division (A) of this section, a majority of 4721
the members of a board of education may adopt a resolution 4722
proposing the levy of an annual tax for school district purposes 4723

H. B. No. 420 Page 161
As Introduced
on school district income. The proposed levy may be for a 4724
continuing period of time or for a specified number of years. 4725
The resolution shall set forth the purpose for which the tax is 4726
to be imposed, the rate of the tax, which shall be the rate set 4727
forth in the commissioner's certification rounded to the nearest 4728
one-fourth of one per cent, the number of years the tax will be 4729
levied or that it will be levied for a continuing period of 4730
time, the date on which the tax shall take effect, which shall 4731
be the first day of January of any year following the year in 4732
which the question is submitted, and the date of the election at 4733
which the proposal shall be submitted to the electors of the 4734
district, which shall be on the date of a primary, general, or 4735
special election the date of which is consistent with section 4736
3501.01 of the Revised Code. The resolution shall specify 4737
whether the income that is to be subject to the tax is taxable 4738
income of individuals and estates as defined in divisions (E)(1) 4739
(a) and (2) of section 5748.01 of the Revised Code or taxable 4740
income of individuals as defined in division (E)(1)(b) of that 4741
section. The specification shall be the same as the 4742
specification in the resolution adopted and certified under 4743
division (A) of this section. 4744
If the tax is to be levied for current expenses and 4745
permanent improvements, the resolution shall apportion the 4746
annual rate of the tax. The apportionment may be the same or 4747
different for each year the tax is levied, but the respective 4748
portions of the rate actually levied each year for current 4749
expenses and for permanent improvements shall be limited by the 4750
apportionment. 4751
If the board of education currently imposes an income tax 4752
pursuant to this chapter that is due to expire and a question is 4753
submitted under this section for a proposed income tax to take 4754

H. B. No. 420 Page 162
As Introduced
effect upon the expiration of the existing tax, the board may 4755
specify in the resolution that the proposed tax renews the 4756
expiring tax. Two or more expiring income taxes may be renewed 4757
under this paragraph if the taxes are due to expire on the same 4758
date. If the tax rate being proposed is no higher than the total 4759
tax rate imposed by the expiring tax or taxes, the resolution 4760
may state that the proposed tax is not an additional income tax. 4761
(2) A board of education adopting a resolution under 4762
division (B)(1) of this section proposing a school district 4763
income tax for a continuing period of time and limited to the 4764
purpose of current expenses may propose in that resolution to 4765
reduce the rate or rates of one or more of the school district's 4766
property taxes levied for a continuing period of time in excess 4767
of the ten-mill limitation for the purpose of current expenses. 4768
The reduction in the rate of a property tax may be any amount, 4769
not exceeding the rate at which the tax is authorized to be 4770
levied. The reduction in the rate of a tax shall first take 4771
effect for the tax year that includes the day on which the 4772
school district income tax first takes effect, and shall 4773
continue for each tax year that both the school district income 4774
tax and the property tax levy are in effect. 4775
In addition to the matters required to be set forth in the 4776
resolution under division (B)(1) of this section, a resolution 4777
containing a proposal to reduce the rate of one or more property 4778
taxes shall state for each such tax the maximum rate at which it 4779
currently may be levied and the maximum rate at which the tax 4780
could be levied after the proposed reduction, expressed in mills 4781
for each one dollar of taxable value, and that the tax is levied 4782
for a continuing period of time. 4783
A board proposing to reduce the rate of one or more 4784

H. B. No. 420 Page 163

property taxes under division (B)(2) of this section shall 4785
comply with division (B) of section 5705.03 of the Revised Code. 4786
In addition to the amounts required in division (B)(2) of that 4787
section, the county auditor shall certify to the board the 4788
levy's effective rate for both the last year before the levy's 4789
proposed reduction and the first year that the reduction 4790
applies, both expressed in dollars for each one hundred thousand 4791
dollars of the county auditor's appraised value. 4792
If a board of education proposes to reduce the rate of one 4793
or more property taxes under division (B)(2) of this section, 4794
the board, when it makes the certification required under 4795
division (A) of this section, shall designate the specific levy 4796
or levies to be reduced, the maximum rate at which each levy 4797
currently is authorized to be levied, and the rate by which each 4798
levy is proposed to be reduced. The tax commissioner, when 4799
making the certification to the board under division (A) of this 4800
section, also shall certify the reduction in the total effective 4801
tax rate for current expenses for each class of property that 4802
would have resulted if the proposed reduction in the rate or 4803
rates had been in effect the previous tax year. As used in this 4804
paragraph, "effective tax rate" has the same meaning as in 4805
section 323.08 of the Revised Code. 4806
(C) A resolution adopted under division (B) of this 4807
section shall go into immediate effect upon its passage, and no 4808
publication of the resolution shall be necessary other than that 4809
provided for in the notice of election. Immediately after its 4810
adoption and at least ninety days prior to the election at which 4811
the question will appear on the ballot, a copy of the resolution 4812
and, if applicable, the county auditor's certifications under 4813
section 5705.03 of the Revised Code shall be certified to the 4814
board of elections of the proper county, which shall submit the 4815

in the county once a week for two consecutive weeks, or as 4820
provided in section 7.16 of the Revised Code, prior to the 4821
election. If the board of elections operates and maintains a web 4822

on its web site for thirty days prior to the election. The 4824
notice shall contain the time and place of the election and the 4825
question to be submitted to the electors. The question covered 4826

but may be printed on the same ballot with any other proposition 4828
submitted at the same election, other than the election of 4829
officers. 4830

(3) If the question includes a proposal under division (B) 4876
(2) of section 5748.02 of the Revised Code to reduce the rate of 4877
one or more school district property taxes, the ballot shall 4878
state that the purpose of the school district income tax is for 4879
current expenses, and the form of the ballot shall be modified 4880
by adding the following language immediately after the statement 4881
of the purpose of the proposed income tax: ", and shall the rate 4882
of an existing tax on property, currently levied for the purpose 4883
of current expenses at the rate of _______ mills, be REDUCED to 4884
_______ mills for each $1 of taxable value, which amounts to a 4885
reduction from $_______ (effective rate) to $_______ (effective 4886

is repealed." In lieu of "for the tax" and "against the tax," 4890
the phrases "for the issue" and "against the issue," 4891
respectively, shall be used. If a board of education proposes a 4892
reduction in the rates of more than one tax, the ballot language 4893
shall be modified accordingly to express the rates at which 4894
those taxes currently are levied and the rates to which the 4895

specified in the resolution. If the question approved by the 4904
voters includes a reduction in the rate of a school district 4905
property tax, the board of education shall not levy the tax at a 4906
rate greater than the rate to which the tax is reduced, unless 4907

section 5748.04 of the Revised Code. 4909
(D) If the rate at which a property tax is levied and 4910
collected is reduced pursuant to a question approved under this 4911
section, the tax commissioner shall compute the percentage 4912
required to be computed for that tax under division (D) of 4913
section 319.301 of the Revised Code each year the rate is 4914
reduced as if the tax had been levied in the preceding year at 4915
the rate at which it has been reduced. If the rate of a property 4916
tax increases due to the repeal of the school district income 4917
tax pursuant to section 5748.04 of the Revised Code, the tax 4918
commissioner, for the first year for which the rate increases, 4919
shall compute the percentage as if the tax in the preceding year 4920

The board of elections shall determine whether the 4934
petition is valid, and if it so determines, it shall do both of 4935
the following: 4936
(1) Submit the question to the electors of the district at 4937
the next general election; 4938
(2) If the rate of one or more property tax levies was 4939
reduced for the duration of the income tax levy pursuant to 4940
division (B)(2) of section 5748.02 of the Revised Code, before 4941
that division's repeal by this act, request that the county 4942
auditor certify to the board, in the same manner as required for 4943

which the levies are increased, rounded to the nearest dollar, 4946
and the levies' effective rates for the year before the proposed 4947
increase and the levies' effective rates for the first year that 4948

thousand dollars of the county auditor's appraised value. 4951

board of elections within ten days after receiving the board's 4953
request. If a school district is located in more than one 4954
county, the county auditor shall obtain from the county auditor 4955
of each other county in which the district is located the tax 4956
valuation applicable to the portion of the district in that 4957

the form of the ballot shall be modified by stating that the tax 4978
currently is levied on the "earned income of individuals 4979

reduced for the duration of the income tax levy pursuant to 4983
division (B)(2) of section 5748.02 of the Revised Code, before 4984

be modified by adding the following language immediately after 4986
"repealed": ", and shall the rate of an existing tax on property 4987

the property tax will increase)." In lieu of "for repeal of the 4995
income tax" and "against repeal of the income tax," the phrases 4996
"for the issue" and "against the issue," respectively, shall be 4997
substituted. 4998
(3) If the rate of more than one property tax was reduced 4999
for the duration of the income tax, the ballot language shall be 5000
modified accordingly to express the rates at which those taxes 5001
currently are levied and the rates to which the taxes would be 5002
increased. 5003
(C) The question covered by the petition shall be 5004
submitted as a separate proposition, but it may be printed on 5005
the same ballot with any other proposition submitted at the same 5006
election other than the election of officers. If a majority of 5007
the qualified electors voting on the question vote in favor of 5008
it, the result shall be certified immediately after the canvass 5009
by the board of elections to the board of education of the 5010
school district and the tax commissioner, who shall thereupon, 5011
after the current year, cease to levy the tax, except that if 5012
notes have been issued pursuant to section 5748.05 of the 5013
Revised Code the tax commissioner shall continue to levy and 5014
collect under authority of the election authorizing the levy an 5015
annual amount, rounded upward to the nearest one-fourth of one 5016
per cent, as will be sufficient to pay the debt charges on the 5017
notes as they fall due. 5018
(D) If a school district income tax repealed pursuant to 5019
this section was approved in conjunction with a reduction in the 5020

H. B. No. 420 Page 171
As Introduced
rate of one or more school district property taxes as provided 5021
in division (B)(2) of section 5748.02 of the Revised Code, 5022
before that division's repeal by this act, then each such 5023
property tax may be levied after the current year at the rate at 5024
which it could be levied prior to the reduction, subject to 5025
section 5705.171 of the Revised Code and any adjustments 5026
required by the county budget commission pursuant to Chapter 5027
5705. of the Revised Code. Upon the repeal of a school district 5028
income tax under this section, the board of education may resume 5029
levying a property tax, the rate of which has been reduced 5030
pursuant to a question approved under section 5748.02 of the 5031
Revised Code, at the rate the board originally was authorized to 5032
levy the tax. A reduction in the rate of a property tax under 5033
section 5748.02 of the Revised Code is a reduction in the rate 5034
at which a board of education may levy that tax only for the 5035
period during which a school district income tax is levied prior 5036
to any repeal pursuant to this section. The resumption of the 5037
authority to levy the tax upon such a repeal does not constitute 5038
a tax levied in excess of the one per cent limitation prescribed 5039
by Section 2 of Article XII, Ohio Constitution, or in excess of 5040
the ten-mill limitation. 5041
(E) This section does not apply to school district income 5042
tax levies that are levied for five or fewer years. 5043
Sec. 5748.09. (A) The board of education of a city, local, 5044
or exempted village school district, at any time by a vote of 5045
two-thirds of all its members, may declare by resolution that it 5046
may be necessary for the school district to do all of the 5047
following: 5048
(1) Raise a specified amount of money for school district 5049
purposes by levying an annual tax on school district income; 5050

(2) Levy an additional property tax in excess of the ten- 5051
mill limitation for the purpose of providing for the necessary 5052
requirements of the district, stating in the resolution the 5053
amount of money to be raised each year for such purpose; 5054
(3) Submit the question of the school district income tax 5055
and property tax to the electors of the district at a special 5056
election. 5057
The resolution shall specify whether the income that is to 5058
be subject to the tax is taxable income of individuals and 5059
estates as defined in divisions (E)(1)(a) and (2) of section 5060
5748.01 of the Revised Code or taxable income of individuals as 5061
defined in division (E)(1)(b) of that section. 5062
On adoption of the resolution, the board shall certify a 5063
copy of it to the tax commissioner and the county auditor not 5064
later than one hundred days prior to the date of the special 5065
election at which the board intends to propose the income tax 5066
and property tax. Not later than ten days after receipt of the 5067
resolution, the tax commissioner, in the same manner as required 5068
by division (A) of section 5748.02 of the Revised Code, shall 5069
estimate the rates designated in divisions (A)(1) and (2) of 5070
that section and certify them to the board. Not later than ten 5071
days after receipt of the resolution, the county auditor, in the 5072
same manner as required by section 5705.195 of the Revised Code, 5073
shall make the calculation specified in that section and certify 5074
it to the board. 5075
(B) On receipt of the tax commissioner's and county 5076
auditor's certifications prepared under division (A) of this 5077
section, the board of education of the city, local, or exempted 5078
village school district, by a vote of two-thirds of all its 5079
members, may adopt a resolution declaring that the amount of 5080

H. B. No. 420 Page 173
As Introduced
taxes that can be raised by all tax levies the district is 5081
authorized to impose, when combined with state and federal 5082
revenues, will be insufficient to provide an adequate amount for 5083
the present and future requirements of the school district, and 5084
that it is therefore necessary to levy, for a specified number 5085
of years or for a continuing period of time, an annual tax for 5086
school district purposes on school district income, and to levy, 5087
for a specified number of years not exceeding ten or for a 5088
continuing period of time, an additional property tax in excess 5089
of the ten-mill limitation for the purpose of providing for the 5090
necessary requirements of the district, and declaring that the 5091
question of the school district income tax and property tax 5092
shall be submitted to the electors of the school district at a 5093
special election, which shall not be earlier than ninety days 5094
after certification of the resolution to the board of elections, 5095
and the date of which shall be consistent with section 3501.01 5096
of the Revised Code. The resolution shall specify all of the 5097
following: 5098
(1) The purpose for which the school district income tax 5099
is to be imposed and the rate of the tax, which shall be the 5100
rate set forth in the tax commissioner's certification rounded 5101
to the nearest one-fourth of one per cent; 5102
