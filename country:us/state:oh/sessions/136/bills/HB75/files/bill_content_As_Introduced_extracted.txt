home owner a written rental agreement for a manufactured home 11
park lot for a term of one year or more that contains terms 12
essentially the same as any alternative month-to-month rental 13
agreement offered to current and prospective tenants and owners. 14
The park operator shall offer the minimum one-year rental 15

rental agreement. 19
(2) The park operator shall deliver the offer to the owner 20
by certified mail, return receipt requested, or in person. If 21
the park operator delivers the offer to the owner in person, the 22
owner shall complete a return showing receipt of the offer. If 23
the owner does not accept the offer, the park operator is 24
discharged from any obligation to make any further such offers. 25
If the owner accepts the offer, the park operator shall, at the 26
expiration of each successive rental agreement, offer the owner 27
another rental agreement, for a term that is mutually agreed 28
upon, and that contains terms essentially the same as the 29
alternative month-to-month agreement. The park operator shall 30
deliver subsequent rental offers by ordinary mail or personal 31
delivery. If the park operator sells the manufactured home park 32
to another manufactured home park operator, the purchaser is 33
bound by the rental agreements entered into by the purchaser's 34
predecessor. 35
(3) If the park operator sells the manufactured home park 36
for a use other than as a manufactured home park, the park 37
operator shall give each tenant and owner a written notification 38
by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by handing it to 39
the tenant or owner in person. If the park operator delivers the 40
notification in person, the recipient shall complete a return 41
showing receipt of the notification. This notification shall 42
contain notice of the sale of the manufactured home park, and 43
notice of the date by which the tenant or owner shall vacate. 44
The date by which the tenant shall vacate shall be at least one 45
hundred twenty days after receipt of the written notification, 46
and the date by which the owner shall vacate shall be at least 47
one hundred eighty days after receipt of the written 48
notification. 49

charges, assessments, or rental fees so disclosed may be 54
increased nor rules changed by a park operator without 55
specifying the date of implementation of the changed fees, 56
charges, assessments, rental fees, or rules, which date shall be 57
not less than thirty days after written notice of the change and 58

fees, charges, or assessments, the refusal shall not be used by 66
the park operator as a cause for eviction in any court. 67

5321.131 of the Revised Code to prohibit 2
manufactured home park operators, condominium 3
associations, neighborhood associations, and 4
landlords from restricting the display of the 5

Chief Steven DiSario Act. 7
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF OHIO:
Section 1. That sections 4781.40, 5301.072, 5311.191, and 8
5321.131 of the Revised Code be amended to read as follows: 9
Sec. 4781.40. (A)(1) The park operator shall offer each 10
home owner a written rental agreement for a manufactured home 11
park lot for a term of one year or more that contains terms 12
essentially the same as any alternative month-to-month rental 13
agreement offered to current and prospective tenants and owners. 14
The park operator shall offer the minimum one-year rental 15
agreement to the owner prior to installation of the home in the 16
manufactured home park or, if the home is in the manufactured 17
home park, prior to the expiration of the owner's existing 18

H. B. No. 75 Page 2
As Introduced
rental agreement. 19
(2) The park operator shall deliver the offer to the owner 20
by certified mail, return receipt requested, or in person. If 21
the park operator delivers the offer to the owner in person, the 22
owner shall complete a return showing receipt of the offer. If 23
the owner does not accept the offer, the park operator is 24
discharged from any obligation to make any further such offers. 25
If the owner accepts the offer, the park operator shall, at the 26
expiration of each successive rental agreement, offer the owner 27
another rental agreement, for a term that is mutually agreed 28
upon, and that contains terms essentially the same as the 29
alternative month-to-month agreement. The park operator shall 30
deliver subsequent rental offers by ordinary mail or personal 31
delivery. If the park operator sells the manufactured home park 32
to another manufactured home park operator, the purchaser is 33
bound by the rental agreements entered into by the purchaser's 34
predecessor. 35
(3) If the park operator sells the manufactured home park 36
for a use other than as a manufactured home park, the park 37
operator shall give each tenant and owner a written notification 38
by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by handing it to 39
the tenant or owner in person. If the park operator delivers the 40
notification in person, the recipient shall complete a return 41
showing receipt of the notification. This notification shall 42
contain notice of the sale of the manufactured home park, and 43
notice of the date by which the tenant or owner shall vacate. 44
The date by which the tenant shall vacate shall be at least one 45
hundred twenty days after receipt of the written notification, 46
and the date by which the owner shall vacate shall be at least 47
one hundred eighty days after receipt of the written 48
notification. 49

As Introduced
(B) A park operator shall fully disclose in writing all 50
fees, charges, assessments, including rental fees, and rules 51
prior to a tenant or owner executing a rental agreement and 52
assuming occupancy in the manufactured home park. No fees, 53
charges, assessments, or rental fees so disclosed may be 54
increased nor rules changed by a park operator without 55
specifying the date of implementation of the changed fees, 56
charges, assessments, rental fees, or rules, which date shall be 57
not less than thirty days after written notice of the change and 58
its effective date to all tenants or owners in the manufactured 59
home park, and no fee, charge, assessment, or rental fee shall 60
be increased during the term of any tenant's or owner's rental 61
agreement. Failure on the part of the park operator to fully 62
disclose all fees, charges, or assessments shall prevent the 63
park operator from collecting the undisclosed fees, charges, or 64
assessments. If a tenant or owner refuses to pay any undisclosed 65
fees, charges, or assessments, the refusal shall not be used by 66
the park operator as a cause for eviction in any court. 67
(C)(1) A park operator shall promulgate rules governing 68
the rental or occupancy of a lot in the manufactured home park. 69
The rules shall not be unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious. A 70
copy of the rules and any amendments to them shall be delivered 71
by the park operator to the tenant or owner prior to signing the 72
rental agreement. A copy of the rules and any amendments to them 73
shall be posted in a conspicuous place upon the manufactured 74
home park grounds. 75
(2) No park operator shall include any restriction in a 76
rental agreement against, or otherwise prohibit on a tenant's or 77
owner's rental property, any of the following: 78
