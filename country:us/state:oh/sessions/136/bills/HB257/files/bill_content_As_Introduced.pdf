(i) of this section shall apply only if the party to whom the 142
money is to be paid made a reasonable attempt to determine if 143
the party required to pay had insurance coverage for liability 144
for the tortious conduct and gave to the party required to pay 145
and to any identified insurer, as nearly simultaneously as 146
practicable, written notice in person or by certified mail that 147
the cause of action had accrued. 148

decree, or order rendered in a civil action based on tortious 160
conduct, if a different period for computing interest on it is 161
specified by law, or if it is rendered in an action against the 162
state in the court of claims, or in an action under Chapter 163
4123. of the Revised Code. 164

dissolution of marriage, or legal separation, the court 187
determines that a party who is a resident of this state is 188
responsible for obtaining health insurance coverage for the 189

support order issued in accordance with sections 3119.29 to 191

former spouse or children who fails to obtain the coverage is 220
liable to the provider for the hospital, surgical, or medical 221
expenses incurred by the provider as a result of the failure to 222
obtain the coverage. This section does not prohibit a former 223
spouse or person responsible for the children from initiating an 224

file or credit report of the party responsible for obtaining 274
health insurance coverage, any information relative to the 275

report immediately. If the agency fails to remove the 300

collection agency has reported the consumer's medical debt to a 332
consumer reporting agency in violation of division (B)(1) of 333

the health care provider or collection agency. 335

to satisfy a judgment or order, or for so much of the excess as 365
will satisfy the judgment. The demand shall be made after the 366
judgment is obtained and at least fifteen days and not more than 367
forty-five days before the order is sought by delivering it to 368

it to the judgment debtor by certified mail, return receipt 370

H. B. No. 257 Page 14
As Introduced
requested, or by sending it to the judgment debtor by regular 371
mail evidenced by a properly completed and stamped certificate 372
of mailing by regular mail, addressed to the judgment debtor's 373
last known place of residence. 374
The demand shall be in substantially the following form: 375
"NOTICE OF COURT PROCEEDING TO COLLECT DEBT 376
Date of mailing or date of service by the court ______________ 377
To: ______________________________ 378
(Name of Judgment Debtor) 379
__________________________________ 380
(Last Known Residence Address of Judgment Debtor) 381
You owe the undersigned _______________________ (Name of 382
Judgment Creditor) $__________, including interest and court 383
costs, for which a judgment was obtained against you or 384
certified in the __________ court on __________, payment of 385
which is hereby demanded. 386
If you do not do one of the three things listed below 387
within fifteen days of the date of the mailing of this notice or 388
of its service by the court, we will go to court, unless we are 389
otherwise precluded by law from doing so, and ask that your 390
employer be ordered to withhold money from your earnings until 391
the judgment is paid in full or, if applicable, is paid to a 392
certain extent and to pay the withheld money to the court in 393
satisfaction of your debt. This is called garnishment of 394
personal earnings. 395
It is to your advantage to avoid garnishment of personal 396
earnings because the placing of the extra burden on your 397

H. B. No. 257 Page 15
As Introduced
employer possibly could cause you to lose your job. 398
YOU CAN AVOID THE GARNISHMENT BY DOING ONE OF THESE THREE 399
THINGS WITHIN THE FIFTEEN-DAY PERIOD: 400
(1) Pay to us the amount due; 401
(2) Complete the attached form entitled "Payment to Avoid 402
Garnishment" and return it to us with the payment, if any, shown 403
due on it; or 404
(3) Apply to your local municipal or county court or, if 405
you are not a resident of Ohio, to the municipal or county court 406
in whose jurisdiction your place of employment is located, for 407
the appointment of a trustee to receive the part of your 408
earnings that is not exempt from garnishment, and notify us that 409
you have applied for the appointment of a trustee. You will be 410
required to list your creditors, the amounts of their claims, 411
and the amounts due on their claims, and the amount you then 412
will pay to your trustee each payday will be divided among them 413
until the debts are paid off. This can be to your advantage 414
because in the meantime none of those creditors can garnish your 415
wages. 416
You also may contact a budget and debt counseling service 417
described in division (D)(E) of section 2716.03 of the Revised 418
Code for the purpose of entering into an agreement for debt 419
scheduling. There may not be enough time to set up an agreement 420
for debt scheduling in order to avoid a garnishment of your 421
wages based upon this demand for payment, but entering into an 422
agreement for debt scheduling might protect you from future 423
garnishments of your wages. Under an agreement for debt 424
scheduling, you will have to regularly pay a portion of your 425
income to the service until the debts subject to the agreement 426

H. B. No. 257 Page 16
As Introduced
are paid off. This portion of your income will be paid by the 427
service to your creditors who are owed debts subject to the 428
agreement. This can be to your advantage because these creditors 429
cannot garnish your wages while you make your payments to the 430
service on time. 431
