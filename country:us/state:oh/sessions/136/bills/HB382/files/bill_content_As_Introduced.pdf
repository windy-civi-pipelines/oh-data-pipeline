indistinguishable from a firearm in a school safety zone is a 426
misdemeanor of the first degree. If the offender previously has 427
been convicted of a violation of this section, illegal 428
possession of an object indistinguishable from a firearm in a 429
school safety zone is a felony of the fifth degree. 430

person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of 432
this section and subject to division (F)(2) of this section, if 433
the offender has not attained nineteen years of age, regardless 434

4510.02 of the Revised Code and shall deny the offender the 444
issuance of any permit or license of that type during the period 445
of the suspension. 446
If the offender is not a resident of this state, the court 447
shall impose a class four suspension of the nonresident 448
operating privilege of the offender from the range specified in 449
division (A)(4) of section 4510.02 of the Revised Code. 450

As Introduced
not suspend one of the types of licenses, permits, or privileges 452
specified in division (F)(1) of this section or deny the 453
issuance of one of the temporary instruction permits specified 454

impose the suspension, revocation, or denial required in that 456
division, but the court, in its discretion, instead may require 457
the offender to perform community service for a number of hours 458
determined by the court. 459
(G) As used in this section, "object that is 460

specialized training in firearms, the object appears to be a 463
firearm. 464

(2) Participating with federal law enforcement to enforce 601

subdivision from participating in an inter-jurisdictional task 627
force for the purpose of enforcing laws not related to firearms, 628

jurisdictional task force for the purpose of enforcing laws 630
related to drugs, human or sex trafficking, immigration, or any 631
other task force convened for purposes other than enforcing any 632
federal acts, laws, executive orders, rules, regulations, 633
statutes, or ordinances regarding firearms, firearm accessories, 634

(J)(1) As specified in section 1.50 of the Revised Code, 636
if any provision of a section of the Revised Code or the 637
application thereof to any person or circumstance is held 638
invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or 639
applications of the section or related sections which can be 640
given effect without the invalid provision or application, and 641
to this end the provisions are severable. 642
(2) Section 2923.50 of the Revised Code shall be strictly 643
construed against the state and shall be liberally construed in 644
favor of the rights of law-abiding citizens. 645
(K) The general assembly of the state of Ohio finds and 646
declares that: 647
(1) The general assembly of the state of Ohio is firmly 648
resolved to support and defend the Constitution of the United 649
States against every aggression, whether foreign or domestic, 650
and is duty-bound to oppose every infraction of those principles 651
that constitute the basis of the union of the states because 652
only a faithful observance of those principles can secure the 653
union's existence and the public happiness. 654
(2) Acting through the Constitution of the United States, 655

H. B. No. 382 Page 24
As Introduced
the people of the several states created the federal government 656
to be their agent in the exercise of a few defined powers, while 657
reserving for the state governments the power to legislate on 658
matters concerning the lives, liberties, and properties of 659
citizens in the ordinary course of affairs. 660
(3) The limitation of the federal government's power is 661
affirmed under the Tenth Amendment to the United States 662
Constitution, which defines the total scope of federal powers as 663
being those which have been delegated by the people of the 664
several states to the federal government, and all powers not 665
delegated to the federal government in the Constitution of the 666
United States are reserved to the states respectively or the 667
people themselves. 668
(4) If the federal government assumes powers that the 669
people did not grant it in the Constitution of the United 670
States, its acts are unauthoritative and of no force. 671
(5) The several states of the United States respect the 672
proper role of the federal government but reject the proposition 673
that such respect requires unlimited submission. If the federal 674
government, created by a compact among the states, were the 675
exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers granted to 676
it by the states through the Constitution of the United States, 677
the federal government's discretion, and not the Constitution of 678
the United States, would necessarily become the measure of those 679
powers. To the contrary, as in all other cases of compacts among 680
powers having no common judge, each party has an equal right to 681
judge for itself as to whether infractions of the compact have 682
occurred, as well as to determine the mode and measure of 683
redress. Although the several states have granted supremacy to 684
laws and treaties made under the powers granted in the 685

H. B. No. 382 Page 25
As Introduced
Constitution of the United States, such supremacy does not 686
extend to various federal statutes, executive orders, 687
administrative orders, court orders, rules, regulations, or 688
other actions that collect data or restrict or prohibit the 689
manufacture, ownership, and use of firearms, firearm 690
accessories, or ammunition exclusively within the borders of 691
Ohio; such statutes, executive orders, administrative orders, 692
court orders, rules, regulations, and other actions exceed the 693
powers granted to the federal government except to the extent 694
they are necessary and proper for governing and regulating the 695
United States armed forces or for organizing, arming, and 696
disciplining militia forces actively employed in the service of 697
the United States armed forces. 698
(6) The people of the several states have given congress 699
the power "to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among 700
the several states," but "regulating commerce" does not include 701
the power to limit citizens' right to keep and bear arms in 702
defense of their families, neighbors, persons, or property nor 703
to dictate what sort of arms and accessories law-abiding 704
citizens may buy, sell, exchange, or otherwise possess within 705
the borders of this state. 706
(7) The people of the several states also have granted 707
congress the power "to lay and collect taxes, duties, imports, 708
and excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the common 709
defense and general welfare of the United States" and "to make 710
all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into 711
execution the powers vested by the Constitution of the United 712
States in the government of the United States, or in any 713
department or office thereof." These constitutional provisions 714
merely identify the means by which the federal government may 715
execute its limited powers and shall not be construed to grant 716

H. B. No. 382 Page 26
As Introduced
unlimited power because to do so would be to destroy the 717
carefully constructed equilibrium between the federal and state 718
governments. Consequently, the general assembly rejects any 719
claim that the taxing and spending powers of congress may be 720
used to diminish in any way the right of the people to keep and 721
bear arms. 722
(8) The general assembly of the state of Ohio finds that 723
the federal excise tax rate on arms and ammunition in effect 724
before January 1, 2021, which funds programs under the Wildlife 725
Restoration Act, does not have a chilling effect on the purchase 726
or ownership of such arms and ammunition. 727
(9) The people of Ohio have vested the general assembly 728
with the authority to regulate the manufacture, possession, 729
exchange, and use of firearms within the borders of this state, 730
subject only to the limits imposed by the Second Amendment to 731
the United States Constitution and the Constitution of Ohio. 732
(10) The general assembly of the state of Ohio strongly 733
promotes responsible gun ownership, including parental 734
supervision of minors in the proper use, storage, and ownership 735
of all firearms; the prompt reporting of stolen firearms; and 736
the proper enforcement of all state gun laws. The general 737
assembly of the state of Ohio hereby condemns any unlawful 738
transfer of firearms and the use of any firearm in any criminal 739
or unlawful activity. 740
Section 2. That existing sections 2923.11, 2923.111, 741
2923.122, and 2923.17 of the Revised Code are hereby repealed. 742
Section 3. This act shall be known as the Second Amendment 743
Protection Act. 744
