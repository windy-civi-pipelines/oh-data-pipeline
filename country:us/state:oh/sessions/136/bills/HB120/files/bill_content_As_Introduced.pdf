contractor or vendor shall request the certification by 2198
certified mail delivered to the contractee, return receipt 2199
requested. Upon receipt of such request and prior to entering 2200
into the contract or agreement, the contractee shall provide to 2201
the contractor or vendor a certification sufficiently detailed 2202
to enable the contractor or vendor to ascertain the resulting 2203

H. B. No. 120 Page 77
As Introduced
classification of all materials purchased or fabricated by the 2204
contractor or vendor and transferred to the contractee. This 2205
requirement applies to a contractee regardless of whether the 2206
contractee holds a direct payment permit under section 5739.031 2207
of the Revised Code or provides to the contractor or vendor an 2208
exemption certificate as provided under this section. 2209
For the purposes of the taxes levied by this chapter and 2210
Chapter 5741. of the Revised Code, the contractor or vendor may 2211
in good faith rely on the contractee's certification. 2212
Notwithstanding division (B) of section 5739.01 of the Revised 2213
Code, if the tax commissioner determines that certain property 2214
certified by the contractee as tangible personal property 2215
pursuant to this division is, in fact, real property, the 2216
contractee shall be considered to be the consumer of all 2217
materials so incorporated into that real property and shall be 2218
liable for the applicable tax, and the contractor or vendor 2219
shall be excused from any liability on those materials. 2220
If a contractee fails to provide such certification upon 2221
the request of the contractor or vendor, the contractor or 2222
vendor shall comply with the provisions of this chapter and 2223
Chapter 5741. of the Revised Code without the certification. If 2224
the tax commissioner determines that such compliance has been 2225
performed in good faith and that certain property treated as 2226
tangible personal property by the contractor or vendor is, in 2227
fact, real property, the contractee shall be considered to be 2228
the consumer of all materials so incorporated into that real 2229
property and shall be liable for the applicable tax, and the 2230
construction contractor or vendor shall be excused from any 2231
liability on those materials. 2232
This division does not apply to any contract or agreement 2233

H. B. No. 120 Page 78
As Introduced
where the tax commissioner determines as a fact that a 2234
certification under this division was made solely on the 2235
decision or advice of the contractor or vendor. 2236
(D) Notwithstanding division (B) of section 5739.01 of the 2237
Revised Code, whenever the total rate of tax imposed under this 2238
chapter is increased after the date after a construction 2239
contract is entered into, the contractee shall reimburse the 2240
construction contractor for any additional tax paid on tangible 2241
property consumed or services received pursuant to the contract. 2242
(E) A vendor who files a petition for reassessment 2243
contesting the assessment of tax on sales for which the vendor 2244
obtained no valid exemption certificates and for which the 2245
vendor failed to establish that the sales were properly not 2246
subject to the tax during the one-hundred-twenty-day period 2247
allowed under division (B) of this section, may present to the 2248
tax commissioner additional evidence to prove that the sales 2249
were properly subject to a claim of exception or exemption. The 2250
vendor shall file such evidence within ninety days of the 2251
receipt by the vendor of the notice of assessment, except that, 2252
upon application and for reasonable cause, the period for 2253
submitting such evidence shall be extended thirty days. 2254
The commissioner shall consider such additional evidence 2255
in reaching the final determination on the assessment and 2256
petition for reassessment. 2257
(F) Whenever a vendor refunds the price, minus any 2258
separately stated delivery charge, of an item of tangible 2259
personal property on which the tax imposed under this chapter 2260
has been paid, the vendor shall also refund the amount of tax 2261
paid, minus the amount of tax attributable to the delivery 2262
charge. 2263

Sec. 5739.17. (A) No person shall engage in making retail 2264
sales subject to a tax imposed by or pursuant to section 2265
5739.02, 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 of the Revised Code as 2266
a business without having a license therefor, except as 2267
otherwise provided in divisions (A)(1), (2), and (3) of this 2268
section. 2269
(1) In the dissolution of a partnership by death, the 2270
surviving partner may operate under the license of the 2271
partnership for a period of sixty days. 2272
(2) The heirs or legal representatives of deceased 2273
persons, and receivers and trustees in bankruptcy, appointed by 2274
any competent authority, may operate under the license of the 2275
person so succeeded in possession. 2276
(3) Two or more persons who are not partners may operate a 2277
single place of business under one license. In such case neither 2278
the retirement of any such person from business at that place of 2279
business, nor the entrance of any person, under an existing 2280
arrangement, shall affect the license or require the issuance of 2281
a new license, unless the person retiring from the business is 2282
the individual named on the vendor's license. 2283
Except as otherwise provided in this section, each 2284
applicant for a license shall make out and deliver to the county 2285
auditor of each county in which the applicant desires to engage 2286
in business, upon a blank to be furnished by such auditor for 2287
that purpose, a statement showing the name of the applicant, 2288
each place of business in the county where the applicant will 2289
make retail sales, the nature of the business, and any other 2290
information the tax commissioner reasonably prescribes in the 2291
form of a statement prescribed by the commissioner. 2292

H. B. No. 120 Page 80
As Introduced
At the time of making the application, the applicant shall 2293
pay into the county treasury a license fee in the sum of fifty 2294
dollars for each fixed place of business in the county that will 2295
be the situs of retail sales. Upon receipt of the application 2296
and exhibition of the county treasurer's receipt, showing the 2297
payment of the license fee, the county auditor shall issue to 2298
the applicant a license for each fixed place of business 2299
designated in the application, authorizing the applicant to 2300
engage in business at that location. The county auditor shall 2301
transmit twenty-five dollars of each license fee to the 2302
treasurer of state for deposit into the state treasury to the 2303
credit of the organized crime commission fund for the purposes 2304
specified in section 177.011 of the Revised Code. The remaining 2305
twenty-five dollars of each license fee shall be credited to the 2306
general fund of the county. 2307
(B) If a vendor's identity changes, the vendor shall apply 2308
for a new license. If a vendor wishes to move an existing fixed 2309
place of business to a new location within the same county, the 2310
vendor shall obtain a new vendor's license or submit a request 2311
to the commissioner to transfer the existing vendor's license to 2312
the new location. When the new location has been verified as 2313
being within the same county, the commissioner shall authorize 2314
the transfer and notify the county auditor of the change of 2315
location. If a vendor wishes to move an existing fixed place of 2316
business to another county, the vendor's license shall not 2317
transfer and the vendor shall obtain a new vendor's license from 2318
the county in which the business is to be located. The form of 2319
the license shall be prescribed by the commissioner. The fees 2320
collected shall be credited as specified in division (A)(3) of 2321
this section. If a vendor fails to notify the commissioner of a 2322
change of location of its fixed place of business or that its 2323

H. B. No. 120 Page 81
As Introduced
business has closed, the commissioner may cancel the vendor's 2324
license if ordinary mail sent to the location shown on the 2325
license is returned because of an undeliverable address. 2326
(C) The commissioner may establish or participate in a 2327
registration system whereby any vendor may obtain a vendor's 2328
license by submitting to the commissioner a vendor's license 2329
application and a license fee of fifty dollars for each fixed 2330
place of business at which the vendor intends to make retail 2331
sales. Under this registration system, the commissioner shall 2332
issue a vendor's license to the applicant on behalf of the 2333
county auditor of the county in which the applicant desires to 2334
engage in business, and shall forward a copy of the application 2335
and license fee to that county. Twenty-five dollars of each 2336
license fee received by the commissioner for the issuance of 2337
vendor's licenses shall be deposited into the vendor's license 2338
application fund, which is hereby created in the state treasury. 2339
The remaining twenty-five dollars of each license fee shall be 2340
deposited into the organized crime commission fund for the 2341
purposes specified in section 177.011 of the Revised Code. The 2342
commissioner shall certify to the director of budget and 2343
management within ten business days after the close of a month 2344
the license fees to be transmitted to each county from the 2345
vendor's license application fund for vendor's license 2346
applications received by the commissioner during that month. 2347
License fees transmitted to a county for which payment was not 2348
received by the commissioner may be netted against a future 2349
distribution to that county, including distributions made 2350
pursuant to section 5739.21 of the Revised Code. 2351
A vendor that makes retail sales subject to tax under 2352
Chapter 5739. of the Revised Code pursuant to a permit issued by 2353
the division of liquor control shall obtain a vendor's license 2354

H. B. No. 120 Page 82
As Introduced
in the identical name and for the identical address as shown on 2355
the permit. 2356
Except as otherwise provided in this section, if a vendor 2357
has no fixed place of business and sells from a vehicle, each 2358
vehicle intended to be used within a county constitutes a place 2359
of business for the purpose of this section. 2360
(D) As used in this section, "transient vendor" means any 2361
person who makes sales of tangible personal property from 2362
vending machines located on land owned by others, who leases 2363
titled motor vehicles, titled watercraft, or titled outboard 2364
motors, who effectuates leases that are taxed according to 2365
division (A)(2) of section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, or who, 2366
in the usual course of the person's business, transports 2367
inventory, stock of goods, or similar tangible personal property 2368
to a temporary place of business or temporary exhibition, show, 2369
fair, flea market, or similar event in a county in which the 2370
person has no fixed place of business, for the purpose of making 2371
retail sales of such property. A "temporary place of business" 2372
means any public or quasi-public place including, but not 2373
limited to, a hotel, rooming house, storeroom, building, part of 2374
a building, tent, vacant lot, railroad car, or motor vehicle 2375
that is temporarily occupied for the purpose of making retail 2376
sales of goods to the public. A place of business is not 2377
temporary if the same person conducted business at the place 2378
continuously for more than six months or occupied the premises 2379
as the person's permanent residence for more than six months, or 2380
if the person intends it to be a fixed place of business. 2381
Any transient vendor, in lieu of obtaining a vendor's 2382
license under division (A) of this section for counties in which 2383
the transient vendor has no fixed place of business, may apply 2384

H. B. No. 120 Page 83
As Introduced
to the tax commissioner, on a form prescribed by the 2385
commissioner, for a transient vendor's license. The transient 2386
vendor's license authorizes the transient vendor to make retail 2387
sales in any county in which the transient vendor does not 2388
maintain a fixed place of business. Any holder of a transient 2389
vendor's license shall not be required to obtain a separate 2390
vendor's license from the county auditor in that county. Upon 2391
the commissioner's determination that an applicant is a 2392
transient vendor, the applicant shall pay a license fee in the 2393
amount of fifty dollars, at which time the tax commissioner 2394
shall issue the license. Twenty-five dollars of that license fee 2395
shall be deposited into the organized crime commission fund for 2396
the purposes specified in section 177.011 of the Revised Code. 2397
The tax commissioner may require a vendor to be licensed as a 2398
transient vendor if, in the opinion of the commissioner, such 2399
licensing is necessary for the efficient administration of the 2400
tax. 2401
Any holder of a valid transient vendor's license may make 2402
retail sales at a temporary place of business or temporary 2403
exhibition, show, fair, flea market, or similar event, held 2404
anywhere in the state without complying with any provision of 2405
section 311.37 of the Revised Code. Any holder of a valid 2406
vendor's license may make retail sales as a transient vendor at 2407
a temporary place of business or temporary exhibition, show, 2408
fair, flea market, or similar event held in any county in which 2409
the vendor maintains a fixed place of business for which the 2410
vendor holds a vendor's license without obtaining a transient 2411
vendor's license. 2412
(E) Any vendor who is issued a license pursuant to this 2413
section shall display the license or a copy of it prominently, 2414
in plain view, at every place of business of the vendor. 2415

H. B. No. 120 Page 84
As Introduced
(F) No owner, organizer, or promoter who operates a fair, 2416
flea market, show, exhibition, convention, or similar event at 2417
which transient vendors are present shall fail to keep a 2418
comprehensive record of all such vendors, listing the vendor's 2419
name, permanent address, vendor's license number, and the type 2420
of goods sold. Such records shall be kept for four years and 2421
shall be open to inspection by the commissioner. 2422
(G) The commissioner may issue additional types of 2423
licenses if required to efficiently administer the tax imposed 2424
by this chapter. 2425
(H) A vendor shall post in a conspicuous manner at all 2426
points of sale on the vendor's premises where firearms are sold 2427
a notice that says the following: "The State of Ohio has 2428
exempted the sale of firearm safety devices from the sales and 2429
use tax imposed by this state and local governments." The 2430
vendor, upon the retail sale or transfer of a firearm, shall 2431
furnish such a written notice to the consumer. 2432
Section 2. That existing sections 5739.01, 5739.02, 2433
5739.03, and 5739.17 of the Revised Code are hereby repealed. 2434
Section 3. The amendment by this act of sections 5739.01, 2435
5739.02, 5739.03, and 5739.17 of the Revised Code applies on and 2436
after the first day of the first month beginning after the 2437
effective date of this section. 2438
Section 4. Section 5739.01 of the Revised Code is 2439
presented in this act as a composite of the section as amended 2440
by both H.B. 315 and S.B. 196 of the 135th General Assembly. The 2441
General Assembly, applying the principle stated in division (B) 2442
of section 1.52 of the Revised Code that amendments are to be 2443
harmonized if reasonably capable of simultaneous operation, 2444

H. B. No. 120 Page 85

finds that the composite is the resulting version of the section 2445
in effect prior to the effective date of the section as 2446
presented in this act. 2447
