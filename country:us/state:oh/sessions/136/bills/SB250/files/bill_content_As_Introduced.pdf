5729.03, or 5747.02 of the Revised Code after one or more units 28

of the underlying land to qualify for a credit authorized by 32
this section, but must include transfer of ownership of the 33
housing unit and at least a leasehold interest in the underlying 34
land. 35
The application shall be made on forms prescribed by the 36
director. The director shall accept and review applications 37
submitted under this section during two annual periods, the 38
first of which begins on the tenth day of January and ends after 39
the first day of February, and the second of which begins on the 40
tenth day of July and ends after the first day of August. If any 41
of those dates fall on a day that is not a business day, then 42
the application period begins on or ends after the next business 43
day, as applicable. The credit shall equal ten per cent of the 44
total cost to construct the housing, including the cost or value 45
of real property on which the housing is built. 46
The eligible nonprofit organization shall include the 47
following information with its application: 48

include land acquisition costs from the purchase of land on 56
which multiple units were constructed, the organization shall 57
apportion the land costs or value to each unit in proportion to 58
the unit's share of the total amount of livable square footage. 59
(4) Any other information the director may require. 60
The director shall review and process applications in the 61
order in which they are received. 62
(C) An eligible nonprofit organization shall be deemed to 63
have facilitated the construction of housing if it enters into 64
an agreement with another person under which the eligible 65
nonprofit organization provides real property through 66
contribution, lease, or similar arrangement, and the other 67
person finances and constructs housing on the real property. 68
(D) An agreement described in division (C) of this 69
section, an agreement to transfer ownership of housing to an 70
owner-occupant, and documents of title transferring such 71
ownership may include any terms that are not contrary to the 72
terms of this section without affecting eligibility for the tax 73
credit authorized by this section. Such terms may include 74
provisions to preserve affordability and owner-occupancy. 75
(E)(1) Subject to division (E)(2) of this section, if the 76
director determines that the applicant qualifies for a credit 77
under this section, the director shall issue, within sixty days 78

shall not exceed twenty-five million dollars for any fiscal 85
year. 86

two million dollars. 89
(3) The credit may be claimed by a person under section 90
5725.38, 5726.61, 5729.21, or 5747.86 of the Revised Code, as 91
applicable. An eligible nonprofit organization that is not 92

5747.02 of the Revised Code shall not claim the credit but may 94
transfer the right to claim the credit under division (G) of 95
this section. 96
(4) The eligible nonprofit organization shall be the sole 97

notification the certificate's number, the name and the tax 116
identification number of the transferee, the amount of remaining 117

transferee may claim the amount of credit received under this 120
division pursuant to and in the manner required under divisions 121
