H. B. No. 250 Page 105
As Introduced
Revised Code, "nonprofit corporation" has the same meaning as in 3053

Section 120:
section 1702.01 of the Revised Code. 3054
(E)(1) Unless otherwise terminated and except for interim 3055
contracts lasting not longer than one year, contracts with 3056
deputy registrars shall be entered into through a competitive 3057
selection process and shall be limited in duration as follows: 3058
(a) For contracts entered into between July 1, 1996 and 3059

more than three years; 3061
(b) For contracts entered into on or after June 29, 2014, 3062

contract with the registrar. The registrar also may remove a 3078

H. B. No. 250 Page 106

office. 3082
(b) If the registrar, with the approval of the director, 3083
determines that there is good cause to believe that a deputy 3084
registrar or a person proposing for a deputy registrar contract 3085
has engaged in any conduct that would require the denial or 3086
termination of the deputy registrar contract, the registrar may 3087
require the production of books, records, and papers as the 3088
registrar determines are necessary, and may take the depositions 3089
of witnesses residing within or outside the state in the same 3090
manner as is prescribed by law for the taking of depositions in 3091
civil actions in the court of common pleas, and for that purpose 3092
the registrar may issue a subpoena for any witness or a subpoena 3093
duces tecum to compel the production of any books, records, or 3094
papers, directed to the sheriff of the county where the witness 3095
resides or is found. Such a subpoena shall be served and 3096
returned in the same manner as a subpoena in a criminal case is 3097
served and returned. The fees of the sheriff shall be the same 3098
as that allowed in the court of common pleas in criminal cases. 3099
Witnesses shall be paid the fees and mileage provided for under 3100

Section 121:
section 119.094 of the Revised Code. The fees and mileage shall 3101
be paid from the fund in the state treasury for the use of the 3102
agency in the same manner as other expenses of the agency are 3103
paid. 3104
In any case of disobedience or neglect of any subpoena 3105
served on any person or the refusal of any witness to testify to 3106
any matter regarding which the witness lawfully may be 3107
interrogated, the court of common pleas of any county where the 3108
disobedience, neglect, or refusal occurs or any judge of that 3109
court, on application by the registrar, shall compel obedience 3110
by attachment proceedings for contempt, as in the case of 3111
disobedience of the requirements of a subpoena issued from that 3112
H. B. No. 250 Page 107
As Introduced
court, or a refusal to testify in that court. 3113
(4) Nothing in division (E) of this section shall be 3114
construed to require a hearing of any nature prior to the 3115
termination of any deputy registrar contract by the registrar, 3116
with the approval of the director, for cause. 3117
(F) Except as provided in section 2743.03 of the Revised 3118
Code, no court, other than the court of common pleas of Franklin 3119
county, has jurisdiction of any action against the department of 3120
public safety, the director, the bureau, or the registrar to 3121
restrain the exercise of any power or authority, or to entertain 3122
any action for declaratory judgment, in the selection and 3123
appointment of, or contracting with, deputy registrars. Neither 3124
the department, the director, the bureau, nor the registrar is 3125
liable in any action at law for damages sustained by any person 3126
because of any acts of the department, the director, the bureau, 3127
or the registrar, or of any employee of the department or 3128
bureau, in the performance of official duties in the selection 3129
and appointment of, and contracting with, deputy registrars. 3130
(G) The registrar shall assign to each deputy registrar a 3131
series of numbers sufficient to supply the demand at all times 3132
in the area the deputy registrar serves, and the registrar shall 3133
keep a record in the registrar's office of the numbers within 3134
the series assigned. Except as otherwise provided in section 3135

Section 122:
3.061 of the Revised Code, each deputy shall be required to give 3136
bond in the amount of at least twenty-five thousand dollars, or 3137
in such higher amount as the registrar determines necessary, 3138
based on a uniform schedule of bond amounts established by the 3139
registrar and determined by the volume of registrations handled 3140
by the deputy. The form of the bond shall be prescribed by the 3141
registrar. The bonds required of deputy registrars, in the 3142
H. B. No. 250 Page 108
As Introduced
discretion of the registrar, may be individual or schedule bonds 3143
or may be included in any blanket bond coverage carried by the 3144
department. 3145
(H) Each deputy registrar shall keep a file of each 3146
application received by the deputy and shall register that motor 3147
vehicle with the name and address of its owner. 3148
(I) Upon request, a deputy registrar shall make the 3149
physical inspection of a motor vehicle and issue the physical 3150
inspection certificate required in section 4505.061 of the 3151
Revised Code. 3152
(J) Each deputy registrar shall file a report semiannually 3153
with the registrar of motor vehicles listing the number of 3154
applicants for licenses the deputy has served, the number of 3155
voter registration applications the deputy has completed and 3156
transmitted to the board of elections, and the number of voter 3157
registration applications declined. 3158

(4)(a) With the prior approval of the registrar, each 3031
deputy registrar may conduct at the location of the deputy 3032
registrar's office any business that is consistent with the 3033

H. B. No. 250 Page 105
As Introduced
Revised Code, "nonprofit corporation" has the same meaning as in 3053

(E)(1) Unless otherwise terminated and except for interim 3055
contracts lasting not longer than one year, contracts with 3056
deputy registrars shall be entered into through a competitive 3057
selection process and shall be limited in duration as follows: 3058
(a) For contracts entered into between July 1, 1996 and 3059
June 29, 2014, for a period of not less than two years, but not 3060
more than three years; 3061
(b) For contracts entered into on or after June 29, 2014, 3062

a shorter contract term is appropriate for a particular deputy 3064
registrar. 3065
(2) All contracts with deputy registrars shall expire on 3066
the last Saturday of June in the year of their expiration. Prior 3067

provision of the Revised Code related to the duties as a deputy, 3076
any rule adopted by the registrar, or a term of the deputy's 3077
contract with the registrar. The registrar also may remove a 3078
deputy who, in the opinion of the registrar, has engaged in any 3079
conduct that is either unbecoming to one representing this state 3080
or is inconsistent with the efficient operation of the deputy's 3081

H. B. No. 250 Page 106
As Introduced
office. 3082
(b) If the registrar, with the approval of the director, 3083
determines that there is good cause to believe that a deputy 3084
registrar or a person proposing for a deputy registrar contract 3085
has engaged in any conduct that would require the denial or 3086
termination of the deputy registrar contract, the registrar may 3087
require the production of books, records, and papers as the 3088
registrar determines are necessary, and may take the depositions 3089
of witnesses residing within or outside the state in the same 3090
manner as is prescribed by law for the taking of depositions in 3091
civil actions in the court of common pleas, and for that purpose 3092
the registrar may issue a subpoena for any witness or a subpoena 3093
duces tecum to compel the production of any books, records, or 3094
papers, directed to the sheriff of the county where the witness 3095
resides or is found. Such a subpoena shall be served and 3096
returned in the same manner as a subpoena in a criminal case is 3097
served and returned. The fees of the sheriff shall be the same 3098
as that allowed in the court of common pleas in criminal cases. 3099
Witnesses shall be paid the fees and mileage provided for under 3100
section 119.094 of the Revised Code. The fees and mileage shall 3101
be paid from the fund in the state treasury for the use of the 3102
agency in the same manner as other expenses of the agency are 3103
paid. 3104
In any case of disobedience or neglect of any subpoena 3105
served on any person or the refusal of any witness to testify to 3106
any matter regarding which the witness lawfully may be 3107
interrogated, the court of common pleas of any county where the 3108
disobedience, neglect, or refusal occurs or any judge of that 3109
court, on application by the registrar, shall compel obedience 3110
by attachment proceedings for contempt, as in the case of 3111
disobedience of the requirements of a subpoena issued from that 3112

H. B. No. 250 Page 107
As Introduced
court, or a refusal to testify in that court. 3113
(4) Nothing in division (E) of this section shall be 3114
construed to require a hearing of any nature prior to the 3115
termination of any deputy registrar contract by the registrar, 3116
with the approval of the director, for cause. 3117
(F) Except as provided in section 2743.03 of the Revised 3118
Code, no court, other than the court of common pleas of Franklin 3119
county, has jurisdiction of any action against the department of 3120
public safety, the director, the bureau, or the registrar to 3121
restrain the exercise of any power or authority, or to entertain 3122
any action for declaratory judgment, in the selection and 3123
appointment of, or contracting with, deputy registrars. Neither 3124
the department, the director, the bureau, nor the registrar is 3125
liable in any action at law for damages sustained by any person 3126
because of any acts of the department, the director, the bureau, 3127
or the registrar, or of any employee of the department or 3128
bureau, in the performance of official duties in the selection 3129
and appointment of, and contracting with, deputy registrars. 3130
(G) The registrar shall assign to each deputy registrar a 3131
series of numbers sufficient to supply the demand at all times 3132
in the area the deputy registrar serves, and the registrar shall 3133
keep a record in the registrar's office of the numbers within 3134
the series assigned. Except as otherwise provided in section 3135
3.061 of the Revised Code, each deputy shall be required to give 3136
bond in the amount of at least twenty-five thousand dollars, or 3137
in such higher amount as the registrar determines necessary, 3138
based on a uniform schedule of bond amounts established by the 3139
registrar and determined by the volume of registrations handled 3140
by the deputy. The form of the bond shall be prescribed by the 3141
registrar. The bonds required of deputy registrars, in the 3142

H. B. No. 250 Page 108
As Introduced
discretion of the registrar, may be individual or schedule bonds 3143
or may be included in any blanket bond coverage carried by the 3144
department. 3145
(H) Each deputy registrar shall keep a file of each 3146
application received by the deputy and shall register that motor 3147
vehicle with the name and address of its owner. 3148
(I) Upon request, a deputy registrar shall make the 3149
physical inspection of a motor vehicle and issue the physical 3150
inspection certificate required in section 4505.061 of the 3151
Revised Code. 3152
(J) Each deputy registrar shall file a report semiannually 3153
with the registrar of motor vehicles listing the number of 3154
applicants for licenses the deputy has served, the number of 3155
voter registration applications the deputy has completed and 3156
transmitted to the board of elections, and the number of voter 3157
registration applications declined. 3158
