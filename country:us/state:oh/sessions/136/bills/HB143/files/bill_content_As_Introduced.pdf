been approved. The reduction shall equal one of the following 25
amounts, as applicable to the person: 26
(i) If the person received a reduction under division (A) 27

charged against the property for the current year, where 52
"effective tax rate" is defined as in section 323.08 of the 53

(iv) The quantity equal to one minus the sum of the 55
percentage reductions in taxes received by the property for the 56
current tax year under section 319.302 of the Revised Code and 57
division (B) of section 323.152 of the Revised Code. 58
(d) The tax commissioner shall adjust the total income 59
threshold described in division (A)(1)(b)(iii) and the reduction 60
amounts described in divisions (A)(1)(c)(i), (A)(2), and (A)(3), 61
and (A)(4) of this section by completing the following 62
calculations in September of each year: 63
(i) Determine the percentage increase in the gross 64
domestic product deflator determined by the bureau of economic 65
analysis of the United States department of commerce from the 66
first day of January of the preceding calendar year to the last 67
day of December of the preceding calendar year; 68
(ii) Multiply that percentage increase by the total income 69
threshold or reduction amount for the current tax year, as 70
applicable; 71

H. B. No. 143 Page 4
As Introduced
(iii) Add the resulting product to the total income 72
threshold or the reduction amount, as applicable, for the 73
current tax year; 74
(iv) Round the resulting sum to the nearest multiple of 75
one hundred dollars. 76
The commissioner shall certify the amount resulting from 77
each adjustment to each county auditor not later than the first 78
day of December each year. The certified total income threshold 79
amount applies to the following tax year for persons described 80
in division (A)(1)(b)(iii) of this section. The certified 81
reduction amount applies to the following tax year. The 82
commissioner shall not make the applicable adjustment in any 83
calendar year in which the amount resulting from the adjustment 84
would be less than the total income threshold or the reduction 85
amount for the current tax year. 86
(2)(a) Real property taxes on a homestead owned and 87
occupied, or a homestead in a housing cooperative occupied, by a 88
disabled veteran shall be reduced for each year for which an 89
application for the reduction has been approved. The reduction 90
shall equal the product obtained by multiplying fifty thousand 91
dollars of the true value of the property in money, as adjusted 92
under division (A)(1)(d) of this section, by the amounts 93
described in divisions (A)(1)(c)(ii) to (iv) of this section. 94
The reduction is in lieu of any reduction under section 323.158 95
of the Revised Code or division (A)(1), (2)(b), or (3), or (4) 96
of this section. The reduction applies to only one homestead 97
owned and occupied by a disabled veteran. 98
(b) Real property taxes on a homestead owned and occupied, 99
or a homestead in a housing cooperative occupied, by the 100
surviving spouse of a disabled veteran shall be reduced for each 101

H. B. No. 143 Page 5
As Introduced
year an application for exemption is approved. The reduction 102
shall equal to the amount of the reduction authorized under 103
division (A)(2)(a) of this section. 104
The reduction is in lieu of any reduction under section 105
323.158 of the Revised Code or division (A)(1), (2)(a), or (3), 106
or (4) of this section. The reduction applies to only one 107
homestead owned and occupied by the surviving spouse of a 108
disabled veteran. A homestead qualifies for a reduction in taxes 109
under division (A)(2)(b) of this section beginning in one of the 110
following tax years: 111
(i) For a surviving spouse described in division (L)(1) of 112
section 323.151 of the Revised Code, the year the disabled 113
veteran dies; 114
(ii) For a surviving spouse described in division (L)(2) 115
of section 323.151 of the Revised Code, the first year on the 116
first day of January of which the total disability rating 117
described in division (F) of that section has been received for 118
the deceased spouse. 119
In either case, the reduction shall continue through the 120
tax year in which the surviving spouse dies or remarries. 121
(3) Real property taxes on a homestead owned and occupied, 122
or a homestead in a housing cooperative occupied, by the 123
surviving spouse of a public service officer killed in the line 124
of duty shall be reduced for each year for which an application 125
for the reduction has been approved. The reduction shall equal 126
the product obtained by multiplying fifty thousand dollars of 127
the true value of the property in money, as adjusted under 128
division (A)(1)(d) of this section, by the amounts described in 129
divisions (A)(1)(c)(ii) to (iv) of this section. The reduction 130

H. B. No. 143 Page 6
As Introduced
is in lieu of any reduction under section 323.158 of the Revised 131
Code or division (A)(1) or , (2), or (4) of this section. The 132
reduction applies to only one homestead owned and occupied by 133
such a surviving spouse. A homestead qualifies for a reduction 134
in taxes under division (A)(3) of this section for the tax year 135
in which the public service officer dies through the tax year in 136
which the surviving spouse dies or remarries. 137
(4) The following persons may, in lieu of any reduction 138
under divisions (A)(1) to (3) of this section, claim a reduction 139
equal to the product obtained by multiplying fifty-six thousand 140
dollars of the true value of the property in money, as adjusted 141
under division (A)(1)(d) of this section, by the amounts 142
described in divisions (A)(1)(c)(ii) to (iv) of this section, 143
for each year for which an application for the reduction has 144
been approved: 145
(a) A person (i) to whom division (A)(1) of this section 146
applies, (ii) whose total income does not exceed the threshold 147
applicable under division (A)(1)(b)(iii) of this section for the 148
tax year, and (iii) who has continuously owned and occupied the 149
homestead for twenty or more years immediately preceding the 150
first day of the tax year or, if the homestead is in a housing 151
cooperative, continuously occupied the homestead for twenty or 152
more years immediately preceding the first day of the tax year; 153
(b) The surviving spouse of a deceased person who applied 154
for a reduction in taxes under division (A)(4) of this section 155
in the year of death and qualified for that reduction under 156
division (A)(4)(a) of this section, provided the surviving 157
spouse occupied the homestead when the deceased person died and 158
has a total income that does not exceed the threshold applicable 159
under division (A)(1)(b)(iii) of this section for the tax year. 160

H. B. No. 143 Page 7
As Introduced
A reduction in taxes under division (A)(4) of this section 161
continues through the tax year in which the recipient dies or 162
until the recipient no longer owns and occupies that property as 163
a homestead or, in the case of a unit in a housing cooperative, 164
occupies that property as a homestead. If the recipient 165
qualifies for the reduction under division (A)(4)(b) of this 166
section and does not meet the criteria prescribed by division 167
(A)(4)(a) of this section, the reduction terminates if the 168
person remarries, beginning with the tax year of the recipient's 169
marriage. 170
(B) To provide a partial exemption, real property taxes on 171
any homestead, and manufactured home taxes on any manufactured 172
or mobile home on which a manufactured home tax is assessed 173
pursuant to division (D)(2) of section 4503.06 of the Revised 174
Code, shall be reduced for each year for which an application 175
for the reduction has been approved. The amount of the reduction 176
shall equal two and one-half per cent of the amount of taxes to 177
be levied by qualifying levies on the homestead or the 178
manufactured or mobile home after applying section 319.301 of 179
the Revised Code. For the purposes of this division, "qualifying 180
levy" has the same meaning as in section 319.302 of the Revised 181
Code. 182
(C) The reductions granted by this section do not apply to 183
special assessments or respread of assessments levied against 184
the homestead, and if there is a transfer of ownership 185
subsequent to the filing of an application for a reduction in 186
taxes, such reductions are not forfeited for such year by virtue 187
of such transfer. 188
(D) The reductions in taxable value referred to in this 189
section shall be applied solely as a factor for the purpose of 190

H. B. No. 143 Page 8

computing the reduction of taxes under this section and shall 191
not affect the total value of property in any subdivision or 192
taxing district as listed and assessed for taxation on the tax 193
lists and duplicates, or any direct or indirect limitations on 194
indebtedness of a subdivision or taxing district. If after 195
application of sections 5705.31 and 5705.32 of the Revised Code, 196
including the allocation of all levies within the ten-mill 197
limitation to debt charges to the extent therein provided, there 198
would be insufficient funds for payment of debt charges not 199
provided for by levies in excess of the ten-mill limitation, the 200
reduction of taxes provided for in sections 323.151 to 323.159 201
of the Revised Code shall be proportionately adjusted to the 202
extent necessary to provide such funds from levies within the 203
ten-mill limitation. 204
(E) No reduction shall be made on the taxes due on the 205
homestead of any person convicted of violating division (D) or 206
(E) of section 323.153 of the Revised Code for a period of three 207
years following the conviction. 208
Sec. 323.153. (A) To obtain a reduction in real property 209
taxes under division (A) or (B) of section 323.152 of the 210
Revised Code or in manufactured home taxes under division (B) of 211
section 323.152 of the Revised Code, the owner shall file an 212
application with the county auditor of the county in which the 213
owner's homestead is located. 214
To obtain a reduction in real property taxes under 215
division (A) of section 323.152 of the Revised Code, the 216
occupant of a homestead in a housing cooperative shall file an 217
application with the nonprofit corporation that owns and 218
operates the housing cooperative, in accordance with this 219
paragraph. Not later than the first day of March each year, the 220

corporation shall obtain applications from the county auditor's 221
office and provide one to each new occupant. Not later than the 222
first day of May, any occupant who may be eligible for a 223
reduction in taxes under division (A) of section 323.152 of the 224
Revised Code shall submit the completed application to the 225
corporation. Not later than the fifteenth day of May, the 226
corporation shall file all completed applications, and the 227
information required by division (B) of section 323.159 of the 228
Revised Code, with the county auditor of the county in which the 229
occupants' homesteads are located. Continuing applications shall 230
be furnished to an occupant in the manner provided in division 231
(C)(4) of this section. 232
(1) An application for reduction based upon a physical 233
disability shall be accompanied by a certificate signed by a 234
physician, and an application for reduction based upon a mental 235
disability shall be accompanied by a certificate signed by a 236
physician or psychologist licensed to practice in this state, 237
attesting to the fact that the applicant is permanently and 238
totally disabled. The certificate shall be in a form that the 239
tax commissioner requires and shall include the definition of 240
permanently and totally disabled as set forth in section 323.151 241
of the Revised Code. An application for reduction based upon a 242
disability certified as permanent and total by a state or 243
federal agency having the function of so classifying persons 244
shall be accompanied by a certificate from that agency. 245
An application by a disabled veteran or the surviving 246
spouse of a disabled veteran for the reduction under division 247
(A)(2)(a) or (b) of section 323.152 of the Revised Code shall be 248
accompanied by a letter or other written confirmation from the 249
United States department of veterans affairs, or its predecessor 250

disabled veteran. 252
An application by the surviving spouse of a public service 253
officer killed in the line of duty for the reduction under 254
division (A)(3) of section 323.152 of the Revised Code shall be 255
accompanied by a letter or other written confirmation from an 256
employee or officer of the board of trustees of a retirement or 257
pension fund in this state or another state or from the chief or 258
other chief executive of the department, agency, or other 259
employer for which the public service officer served when killed 260
in the line of duty affirming that the public service officer 261
was killed in the line of duty. 262
An application for a reduction under division (A)(4) of 263
section 323.152 of the Revised Code shall be accompanied by 264
documentation sufficient to prove that the applicant meets all 265
qualifications for that reduction. 266
An application for a reduction under division (A) of 267
section 323.152 of the Revised Code constitutes a continuing 268
application for a reduction in taxes for each year in which the 269
dwelling is the applicant's homestead. 270
(2) An application for a reduction in taxes under division 271
(B) of section 323.152 of the Revised Code shall be filed only 272
if the homestead or manufactured or mobile home was transferred 273
in the preceding year or did not qualify for and receive the 274
reduction in taxes under that division for the preceding tax 275
year. The application for homesteads transferred in the 276
preceding year shall be incorporated into any form used by the 277
county auditor to administer the tax law in respect to the 278
conveyance of real property pursuant to section 319.20 of the 279
Revised Code or of used manufactured homes or used mobile homes 280
as defined in section 5739.0210 of the Revised Code. The owner 281

As Introduced
of a manufactured or mobile home who has elected under division 282
(D)(4) of section 4503.06 of the Revised Code to be taxed under 283
division (D)(2) of that section for the ensuing year may file 284
the application at the time of making that election. The 285
application shall contain a statement that failure by the 286
applicant to affirm on the application that the dwelling on the 287
property conveyed is the applicant's homestead prohibits the 288
owner from receiving the reduction in taxes until a proper 289
application is filed within the period prescribed by division 290
(A)(3) of this section. Such an application constitutes a 291
continuing application for a reduction in taxes for each year in 292
which the dwelling is the applicant's homestead. 293
(3) Failure to receive a new application filed under 294
division (A)(1) or (2) or notification under division (C) of 295
this section after an application for reduction has been 296
approved is prima-facie evidence that the original applicant is 297
entitled to the reduction in taxes calculated on the basis of 298
the information contained in the original application. The 299
original application and any subsequent application, including 300
any late application, shall be in the form of a signed statement 301
and shall be filed on or before the thirty-first day of December 302
of the year for which the reduction is sought. The original 303
application and any subsequent application for a reduction in 304
manufactured home taxes shall be filed in the year preceding the 305
year for which the reduction is sought. The statement shall be 306
on a form, devised and supplied by the tax commissioner, which 307
shall require no more information than is necessary to establish 308
the applicant's eligibility for the reduction in taxes and the 309
amount of the reduction, and, except for homesteads that are 310
units in a housing cooperative, shall include an affirmation by 311
the applicant that ownership of the homestead was not acquired 312

H. B. No. 143 Page 12
As Introduced
from a person, other than the applicant's spouse, related to the 313
owner by consanguinity or affinity for the purpose of qualifying 314
for the real property or manufactured home tax reduction 315
provided for in division (A) or (B) of section 323.152 of the 316
Revised Code. The form shall contain a statement that conviction 317
of willfully falsifying information to obtain a reduction in 318
taxes or failing to comply with division (C) of this section 319
results in the revocation of the right to the reduction for a 320
period of three years. In the case of an application for a 321
reduction in taxes for persons described in division (A)(1)(b) 322
(iii) of section 323.152 of the Revised Code, the form shall 323
contain a statement that signing the application constitutes a 324
delegation of authority by the applicant to the tax commissioner 325
or the county auditor, individually or in consultation with each 326
other, to examine any tax or financial records relating to the 327
income of the applicant as stated on the application for the 328
purpose of determining eligibility for the exemption or a 329
possible violation of division (D) or (E) of this section. 330
(B) A late application for a tax reduction for the year 331
preceding the year in which an original application is filed, or 332
for a reduction in manufactured home taxes for the year in which 333
an original application is filed, may be filed with the original 334
application. If the county auditor determines the information 335
contained in the late application is correct, the auditor shall 336
determine the amount of the reduction in taxes to which the 337
applicant would have been entitled for the preceding tax year 338
had the applicant's application been timely filed and approved 339
in that year. 340
The amount of such reduction shall be treated by the 341
auditor as an overpayment of taxes by the applicant and shall be 342
refunded in the manner prescribed in section 5715.22 of the 343

H. B. No. 143 Page 13
As Introduced
Revised Code for making refunds of overpayments. The county 344
auditor shall certify the total amount of the reductions in 345
taxes made in the current year under this division to the tax 346
commissioner, who shall treat the full amount thereof as a 347
reduction in taxes for the preceding tax year and shall make 348
reimbursement to the county therefor in the manner prescribed by 349
section 323.156 of the Revised Code, from money appropriated for 350
that purpose. 351
(C)(1) If, in any year after an application has been filed 352
under division (A)(1) or (2) of this section, the owner does not 353
qualify for a reduction in taxes on the homestead or on the 354
manufactured or mobile home set forth on such application, the 355
owner shall notify the county auditor that the owner is not 356
qualified for a reduction in taxes. 357
(2) If, in any year after an application has been filed 358
under division (A)(1) of this section, the occupant of a 359
homestead in a housing cooperative does not qualify for a 360
reduction in taxes on the homestead, the occupant shall notify 361
the county auditor that the occupant is not qualified for a 362
reduction in taxes or file a new application under division (A) 363
(1) of this section. 364
(3) If the county auditor or county treasurer discovers 365
that an owner of property or occupant of a homestead in a 366
housing cooperative not entitled to the reduction in taxes under 367
division (A) or (B) of section 323.152 of the Revised Code 368
failed to notify the county auditor as required by division (C) 369
(1) or (2) of this section, a charge shall be imposed against 370
the property in the amount by which taxes were reduced under 371
that division for each tax year the county auditor ascertains 372
that the property was not entitled to the reduction and was 373

H. B. No. 143 Page 14
As Introduced
owned by the current owner or, in the case of a homestead in a 374
housing cooperative, occupied by the current occupant. Interest 375
shall accrue in the manner prescribed by division (B) of section 376
323.121 or division (G)(2) of section 4503.06 of the Revised 377
Code on the amount by which taxes were reduced for each such tax 378
year as if the reduction became delinquent taxes at the close of 379
the last day the second installment of taxes for that tax year 380
could be paid without penalty. The county auditor shall notify 381
the owner or occupant, by ordinary mail, of the charge, of the 382
owner's or occupant's right to appeal the charge, and of the 383
manner in which the owner or occupant may appeal. The owner or 384
occupant may appeal the imposition of the charge and interest by 385
filing an appeal with the county board of revision not later 386
than the last day prescribed for payment of real and public 387
utility property taxes under section 323.12 of the Revised Code 388
following receipt of the notice and occurring at least ninety 389
days after receipt of the notice. The appeal shall be treated in 390
the same manner as a complaint relating to the valuation or 391
assessment of real property under Chapter 5715. of the Revised 392
Code. The charge and any interest shall be collected as other 393
delinquent taxes. 394
(4) Each year during January, the county auditor shall 395
furnish by ordinary mail a continuing application to each person 396
receiving a reduction under division (A) of section 323.152 of 397
the Revised Code. The continuing application shall be used to 398
report changes in total income, ownership, occupancy, 399
disability, and other information earlier furnished the auditor 400
relative to the reduction in taxes on the property. The 401
continuing application shall be returned to the auditor not 402
later than the thirty-first day of December; provided, that if 403
such changes do not affect the status of the homestead exemption 404

H. B. No. 143 Page 15

or the amount of the reduction to which the owner is entitled 405
under division (A) of section 323.152 of the Revised Code or to 406
which the occupant is entitled under section 323.159 of the 407
Revised Code, the application does not need to be returned. 408
(5) Each year during February, the county auditor, except 409
as otherwise provided in this paragraph, shall furnish by 410
ordinary mail an original application to the owner, as of the 411
first day of January of that year, of a homestead or a 412
manufactured or mobile home that transferred during the 413
preceding calendar year and that qualified for and received a 414
reduction in taxes under division (B) of section 323.152 of the 415
Revised Code for the preceding tax year. In order to receive the 416
reduction under that division, the owner shall file the 417
application with the county auditor not later than the thirty- 418
first day of December. If the application is not timely filed, 419
the auditor shall not grant a reduction in taxes for the 420
homestead for the current year, and shall notify the owner that 421
the reduction in taxes has not been granted, in the same manner 422

manufactured or mobile home is eligible for a homestead 659
exemption on the land upon which the home is located, the 660
reduction to which the owner or spouse is entitled under this 661

A reduction in taxes under division (F) of this section 704
shall continue through the tax year in which the recipient dies 705

Sec. 4503.066. (A)(1) To obtain a tax reduction under 713
section 4503.065 of the Revised Code, the owner of the home 714

taxes based upon a physical disability shall be accompanied by a 717
certificate signed by a physician, and an application for 718
reduction in taxes based upon a mental disability shall be 719

totally disabled, shall be in a form that the department of 723
taxation requires, and shall include the definition of totally 724
and permanently disabled as set forth in section 4503.064 of the 725
Revised Code. An application for reduction in taxes based upon a 726
disability certified as permanent and total by a state or 727

disabled veteran. 736
An application by the surviving spouse of a public service 737
officer killed in the line of duty for the reduction under 738
division (C) of section 4503.065 of the Revised Code shall be 739

An application for a reduction under division (F) of 747
section 4503.065 of the Revised Code shall be accompanied by 748
documentation sufficient to prove that the applicant meets all 749
qualifications for that reduction. 750
(2) Each application shall constitute a continuing 751
application for a reduction in taxes for each year in which the 752
manufactured or mobile home is occupied by the applicant. 753
Failure to receive a new application or notification under 754
division (B) of this section after an application for reduction 755
has been approved is prima-facie evidence that the original 756
applicant is entitled to the reduction calculated on the basis 757
of the information contained in the original application. The 758
original application and any subsequent application shall be in 759

H. B. No. 143 Page 27
As Introduced
the form of a signed statement and shall be filed on or before 760
the thirty-first day of December of the year preceding the year 761
for which the reduction is sought. The statement shall be on a 762
form, devised and supplied by the tax commissioner, that shall 763
require no more information than is necessary to establish the 764
applicant's eligibility for the reduction in taxes and the 765
amount of the reduction to which the applicant is entitled. The 766
form shall contain a statement that signing such application 767
constitutes a delegation of authority by the applicant to the 768
tax commissioner or the county auditor, individually or in 769
consultation with each other, to examine any tax or financial 770
records that relate to the income of the applicant as stated on 771
the application for the purpose of determining eligibility 772
under, or possible violation of, division (C) or (D) of this 773
section. The form also shall contain a statement that conviction 774
of willfully falsifying information to obtain a reduction in 775
taxes or failing to comply with division (B) of this section 776
shall result in the revocation of the right to the reduction for 777
a period of three years. 778
(3) A late application for a reduction in taxes for the 779
year preceding the year for which an original application is 780
filed may be filed with an original application. If the auditor 781
determines that the information contained in the late 782
application is correct, the auditor shall determine both the 783
amount of the reduction in taxes to which the applicant would 784
have been entitled for the current tax year had the application 785
been timely filed and approved in the preceding year, and the 786
amount the taxes levied under section 4503.06 of the Revised 787
Code for the current year would have been reduced as a result of 788
the reduction. When an applicant is permanently and totally 789
disabled on the first day of January of the year in which the 790

H. B. No. 143 Page 28
As Introduced
applicant files a late application, the auditor, in making the 791
determination of the amounts of the reduction in taxes under 792
division (A)(3) of this section, is not required to determine 793
that the applicant was permanently and totally disabled on the 794
first day of January of the preceding year. 795
The amount of the reduction in taxes pursuant to a late 796
application shall be treated as an overpayment of taxes by the 797
applicant. The auditor shall credit the amount of the 798
overpayment against the amount of the taxes or penalties then 799
due from the applicant, and, at the next succeeding settlement, 800
the amount of the credit shall be deducted from the amount of 801
any taxes or penalties distributable to the county or any taxing 802
unit in the county in the same proportions that the amount of 803
manufactured home tax levied by the county or each taxing unit 804
in the county in the current tax year bears to the amount of 805
such tax levied by the county and all such units in the county 806
in the current tax year. If, after the credit has been made, 807
there remains a balance of the overpayment, or if there are no 808
taxes or penalties due from the applicant, the auditor shall 809
refund that balance to the applicant by a warrant drawn on the 810
county treasurer in favor of the applicant. The treasurer shall 811
pay the warrant from the general fund of the county. If there is 812
insufficient money in the general fund to make the payment, the 813
treasurer shall pay the warrant out of any undivided 814
manufactured or mobile home taxes subsequently received by the 815
treasurer for distribution to the county or taxing district in 816
the county that received the benefit of the overpaid taxes, in 817
proportion to the benefits previously received, and the amount 818
paid from the undivided funds shall be deducted from the money 819
otherwise distributable to the county or taxing district in the 820
county at the next or any succeeding distribution. At the next 821

H. B. No. 143 Page 29
As Introduced
or any succeeding distribution after making the refund, the 822
treasurer shall reimburse the general fund for any payment made 823
from that fund by deducting the amount of that payment from the 824
money distributable to the county or other taxing unit in the 825
county that has received the benefit of the taxes, in proportion 826
to the benefits previously received. On the second Monday in 827
September of each year, the county auditor shall certify the 828
total amount of the reductions in taxes made in the current year 829
under division (A)(3) of this section to the tax commissioner 830
who shall treat that amount as a reduction in taxes for the 831
current tax year and shall make reimbursement to the county of 832
that amount in the manner prescribed in section 4503.068 of the 833
Revised Code, from moneys appropriated for that purpose. 834
(B)(1) If in any year for which an application for 835
reduction in taxes has been approved the owner no longer 836
qualifies for the reduction, the owner shall notify the county 837
auditor that the owner is not qualified for a reduction in 838
taxes. 839
(2) If the county auditor or county treasurer discovers 840
that an owner not entitled to the reduction in manufactured home 841
taxes under section 4503.065 of the Revised Code failed to 842
notify the county auditor as required by division (B)(1) of this 843
section, a charge shall be imposed against the manufactured or 844
mobile home in the amount by which taxes were reduced under that 845
section for each tax year the county auditor ascertains that the 846
