Honoring the Village of Hamler on its
Sesquicentennial.
WHEREAS, The members of the Senate of the 136th General Assembly 1
of Ohio are pleased to congratulate the Village of Hamler on its One 2
Hundred Fiftieth Anniversary; and 3
WHEREAS, America is only as strong as her individual communities, 4
which are unique and which make significant contributions to the 5
culture of our state and nation. Since its founding in 1875, the 6
Village of Hamler has experienced dramatic growth and change, and yet, 7
commendably, it has retained the many engaging qualities that have 8
endeared it to generations of inhabitants. Clearly, it has built on 9
the best traditions of the past to ensure a future filled with hope 10
and promise; and 11
WHEREAS, Over the past century and a half, the Village of Hamler 12
has been known for the friendliness of its residents, the 13
professionalism of its officials, and the industriousness of its 14
leaders, and all those who have lived or worked in this beautiful 15
community have just cause to be proud. Indeed, they have exhibited 16
cooperation, integrity, and a willingness to join together to advance 17
the common good, and they have built on the traditions of the past in 18
order to ensure a prosperous future; and 19
WHEREAS, The One Hundred Fiftieth Anniversary of the Village of 20
Hamler offers its citizens the opportunity to share their memories and 21
experiences and to reflect on life in their close-knit community. A 22
vigorous commitment to public service and an earnest devotion to lofty 23
ideals have long been second nature to many of the village residents, 24
and vigilance, industriousness, and generosity have come to typify 25
their collective character; therefore be it 26
