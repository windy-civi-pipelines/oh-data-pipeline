life imprisonment without parole, or any felony of the second 1288
degree that is an offense of violence and the trier of fact 1289
finds that the offense involved an attempt to cause or a threat 1290

(iv) The court finds that the prison terms imposed 1297
pursuant to division (B)(2)(a)(iii) of this section and, if 1298
applicable, division (B)(1) or (3) of this section are 1299
inadequate to punish the offender and protect the public from 1300
future crime, because the applicable factors under section 1301

recidivism outweigh the applicable factors under that section 1303
indicating a lesser likelihood of recidivism. 1304
(v) The court finds that the prison terms imposed pursuant 1305
to division (B)(2)(a)(iii) of this section and, if applicable, 1306
division (B)(1) or (3) of this section are demeaning to the 1307
seriousness of the offense, because one or more of the factors 1308
under section 2929.12 of the Revised Code indicating that the 1309
offender's conduct is more serious than conduct normally 1310
constituting the offense are present, and they outweigh the 1311

constituting the offense. 1314

two or more offenses committed at the same time or as part of 1348
the same act or event shall be considered one offense, and that 1349
one offense shall be the offense with the greatest penalty. 1350

this section shall not be reduced pursuant to section 2929.20, 1352
division (A)(2) or (3) of section 2967.193 or 2967.194, or any 1353

court imposing sentence upon an offender for a felony finds that 1380
the offender is guilty of corrupt activity with the most serious 1381
offense in the pattern of corrupt activity being a felony of the 1382
first degree, or if the offender is guilty of an attempted 1383
violation of section 2907.02 of the Revised Code and, had the 1384
offender completed the violation of section 2907.02 of the 1385
Revised Code that was attempted, the offender would have been 1386
subject to a sentence of life imprisonment or life imprisonment 1387
without parole for the violation of section 2907.02 of the 1388
Revised Code, the court shall impose upon the offender for the 1389

in this division that cannot be reduced pursuant to section 1391
2929.20, division (A)(2) or (3) of section 2967.193 or 2967.194, 1392

division (A)(1)(a) of this section applies, the mandatory prison 1397
term shall be the longest minimum prison term prescribed in that 1398

finds that the consecutive service is necessary to protect the 1683
public from future crime or to punish the offender and that 1684
consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the 1685
seriousness of the offender's conduct and to the danger the 1686
offender poses to the public, and if the court also finds any of 1687
the following: 1688
(a) The offender committed one or more of the multiple 1689

release control for a prior offense. 1693
(b) At least two of the multiple offenses were committed 1694
as part of one or more courses of conduct, and the harm caused 1695
by two or more of the multiple offenses so committed was so 1696
great or unusual that no single prison term for any of the 1697
offenses committed as part of any of the courses of conduct 1698
adequately reflects the seriousness of the offender's conduct. 1699

demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect 1701
the public from future crime by the offender. 1702
