WHEREAS, The members of the Senate of the 136th General Assembly 1

WHEREAS, The talented Notre Dame High School softball team is, 4
indeed, to be heartily commended for decisively earning this year’s 5

history. The squad’s performance reflects the outstanding collective 7
effort by a gifted group of athletes, and without exception, the team 8
has devoted countless hours to training and practice in order to 9
ensure peak conditioning. Clearly, this demanding regimen has paid 10
handsome dividends; and 11
WHEREAS, The members of the Notre Dame High School softball team 12
have epitomized the power, poise, and precision that befit true 13
champions. Despite sometimes grueling pressure, they have consistently 14
maintained their composure and morale, exhibiting strength, speed, 15
stamina, and agility in every challenging encounter. Time and again, 16
they have risen to the occasion, amply demonstrating their unflagging 17
determination, and their impressive maturity and finesse have earned 18
them widespread respect, even among their most formidable rivals; and 19
WHEREAS, By weathering a rigorous schedule and prevailing over a 20
host of adversaries, the members of the Notre Dame High School 21
softball team have learned much about dedication, self-discipline, 22
leadership, and perseverance. Their first-place finish is a measure of 23
their stalwart commitment to the sport, and their indomitable spirit 24
has made their families, friends, and coach, Shad Ford, incredibly 25
proud; therefore be it 26
