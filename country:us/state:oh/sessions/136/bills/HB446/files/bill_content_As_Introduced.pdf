beneficiaries, the settlor, in the trust instrument, may waive 431
or modify the duties of the trustee described in divisions (B) 432

them to the current beneficiaries. The beneficiary surrogate or 441
surrogates shall act in good faith to protect the interests of 442

section, it is the policy of this state to give maximum effect 450
to the principle of freedom of disposition and to the 451
enforceability of governing instruments. 452
Sec. 5801.07. (A) Without precluding other means for 453
establishing a sufficient connection with the designated 454
jurisdiction, the terms of a trust designating the principal 455
place of administration of the trust are valid and controlling 456
if a trustee's principal place of business is located in or a 457
trustee is a resident of the designated jurisdiction or if all 458
or part of the administration occurs in the designated 459
jurisdiction. 460
(B) A trustee is under a continuing duty to administer the 461
trust at a place appropriate to its purposes, its 462
administration, and the interests of the beneficiaries. If there 463
is more than one place reasonably appropriate for administration 464
of a trust, the trustee may administer the trust at any of those 465
places. The original place of administration selected by the 466
settlor remains an appropriate place of administration. 467
(C) Without precluding the right of the court to order, 468
approve, or disapprove a transfer, the trustee, in furtherance 469

(E) In connection with a transfer of the trust's principal 486
place of administration, the trustee may transfer some or all of 487
the trust property to a successor trustee designated in the 488
terms of the trust or appointed pursuant to section 5807.04 of 489
the Revised Code. 490
Sec. 5806.02. (A) Unless the terms of a trust expressly 491
provide that the trust is irrevocable, the settlor may revoke or 492
amend the trust. This division does not apply to a trust created 493
under an instrument executed before January 1, 2007. 494
(B) If a revocable trust is created or funded by more than 495
one settlor, all of the following apply: 496
(1) To the extent the trust consists of community 497
property, either spouse acting alone may revoke the trust, but 498
the trust may be amended only by joint action of both spouses. 499
(2) To the extent the trust consists of property other 500
than community property, each settlor may revoke or amend the 501
trust with regard to the portion of the trust property 502
attributable to that settlor's contribution. 503

H. B. No. 446 Page 19
As Introduced
(3) Upon the revocation or amendment of the trust by less 504
than all of the settlors, the trustee shall promptly notify the 505
other settlors of the revocation or amendment. 506
(C) The settlor may revoke or amend a revocable trust by 507
substantial compliance with a method provided in the terms of 508
the trust or, if the terms of the trust do not provide a method, 509
by any method manifesting clear and convincing evidence of the 510
settlor's intent, provided that a revocable trust may not be 511
revoked or amended by a will or codicil, regardless of whether 512
it refers to the trust or specifically devises property that 513
would otherwise have passed according to the terms of the trust 514
unless the terms of the trust expressly allow it to be revoked 515
or amended by a will or codicil. 516
(D) Upon revocation of a revocable trust, the trustee 517
shall deliver the trust property as the settlor directs. 518
(E) An agent under a power of attorney may exercise a 519
settlor's powers with respect to revocation, amendment, 520
withdrawal of trust property, or the ability to direct the 521
distribution of trust property only to the extent expressly 522
authorized by both the terms of the trust and the power. 523
(F) A guardian of the estate of the settlor or, if no 524
guardian of the estate has been appointed, a guardian of the 525
person of the settlor may exercise a settlor's powers with 526
respect to revocation, amendment, or distribution of trust 527
property only with the approval of the court supervising the 528
guardianship. 529
(G) A trustee who does not know that a trust has been 530
revoked or amended is not liable to the settlor or settlor's 531
successors in interest for distributions made and other actions 532

H. B. No. 446 Page 20
As Introduced
taken on the assumption that the trust had not been amended or 533
revoked. 534
Sec. 5806.03. (A) During the lifetime of the settlor of a 535
revocable trust, whether or not the settlor has capacity to 536
revoke the trust, the rights of the beneficiaries are subject to 537
the control of the settlor, and the duties of the trustee, 538
including the duties to inform and report under section 5808.13 539
of the Revised Code, are owed exclusively to the settlor. If the 540
trustee breaches its duty during the lifetime of the settlor, 541
any recovery obtained from the trustee after the settlor becomes 542
incapacitated or dies shall be apportioned by the court. If the 543
settlor is living when the recovery is obtained, the court shall 544
apportion the recovery between the settlor and the trust, or 545
allocate the entire recovery to the settlor or the trust, as it 546
determines to be equitable under the circumstances. If the 547
settlor is not living when the recovery is obtained, the court 548
shall apportion the recovery between the settlor's estate and 549
the trust, or allocate the entire recovery to the settlor's 550
estate or the trust, as it determines to be equitable under the 551
circumstances. 552
(B) During the period the power may be exercised, the 553
holder of a power of withdrawal has the rights of a settlor of a 554
revocable trust under this section to the extent of the property 555
subject to the power. 556
(C) While a trust is revocable, the trustee may follow a 557
direction of the settlor that is contrary to the terms of the 558
trust. 559
Sec. 5808.161. (A) As used in this section : 560
(1) "Protector" has the same meaning as in section 5818.01 561

H. B. No. 446 Page 21

(2) "Internal Revenue Code" has the same meaning as in 563
section 5747.01 of the Revised Code. 564
(B) With respect to any trust, or portion thereof, that is 565
treated as being owned by a person under sections 671 to 679 of 566
the Internal Revenue Code or any similar federal, state, or 567
other tax law, the trustee, in the trustee's sole discretion, 568
may pay to the appropriate taxing authority or may reimburse the 569
person being treated as the owner any amount of the person's 570
income tax liability attributable to the inclusion of the 571
trust's income, capital gains, deductions, or credits in the 572
calculation of the person's taxable income. In the trustee's 573
sole discretion, the trustee may pay such tax reimbursement 574
amount to the person directly or to the appropriate taxing 575
authority. 576
(C) This section applies to all trusts, whether created 577
on, before, or after the effective date of this section, unless 578
any of the following apply: 579
(1) Applying this section would reduce or prevent a 580
contribution to the trust from qualifying for a federal tax 581
benefit, including a federal tax exclusion or deduction, which 582
was originally claimed or could have been claimed for the 583
contribution; 584
(2) The trust is a grantor retained annuity trust or 585
grantor retained unitrust during a term interest under paragraph 586
(c)(3) of section 2702 of the Internal Revenue Code; 587
(3) Applying this section would be the only trigger that 588
would result in any trust, or portion thereof, as treated as 589
being owned by a person under sections 671 to 679 of the 590

H. B. No. 446 Page 22
As Introduced
Internal Revenue Code or any similar federal, state, or other 591
tax law. This division does not prohibit reimbursement in a 592
subsequent year provided that the reimbursement relates to a 593
year in which the person was treated as an owner under sections 594
671 to 679 of the Internal Revenue Code. 595
(D) A trustee who acts in good faith in exercising or not 596
exercising the power granted by this section is rebuttably 597
presumed to have acted in accordance with the terms and purposes 598
of the trust and the interests of the beneficiaries, and no 599
inference of impropriety shall arise as a result of a trustee 600
exercising or not exercising the power. 601
(E)(1) If the terms of a trust require the trustee to act 602
at the direction or with the consent of a protector or that the 603
decisions governed by this section be made directly by a 604
protector, the powers granted by this section to the trustee 605
shall instead or also be granted, pursuant to the terms of the 606
trust, to the protector. 607
(2) If a protector is granted powers under division (E)(1) 608
of this section, that person is subject to the limitations 609
described in this section, which shall be applied as if the 610
protector were a trustee. 611
(F) A person shall not be considered a beneficiary of a 612
trust solely by reason of the application of this section or the 613
application of a similar provision in the trust instrument. 614
Sec. 5808.19. (A) As used in this section, unless 615
otherwise provided in any other provision in this section: 616
(1)(1)(a) "Beneficiary" means includes the beneficiary of 617
a primary gift, the beneficiary of a future interest, and 618
includes a class member if the future interest is in the form of 619

H. B. No. 446 Page 23
As Introduced
a class gift. 620
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this division, the 621
amendment to division (A)(1)(a) of this section in this act 622
shall be given retroactive effect to the fullest extent 623
permitted under Ohio Constitution, Article II, Section 28. The 624
amendment shall not be given retroactive effect in those 625
instances where doing so would invalidate or supersede any 626
instrument that conveys real property or any interest in the 627
real property, recorded in the office of the county recorder in 628
which that real property is situated. 629
(2) "Class member" means an individual who fails to 630
survive the distribution date by at least one hundred twenty 631
hours but who would have taken under a future interest in the 632
form of a class gift had the individual survived the 633
distribution date by at least one hundred twenty hours. 634
(3) "Descendant of a grandparent of the transferor" means 635
an individual who would qualify as a descendant of a grandparent 636
of the transferor under the rules of construction that would 637
apply to a class gift under the transferor's will to the 638
descendants of the transferor's grandparent. 639
(4) "Distribution date," with respect to a future 640
interest, means the time when the future interest is to take 641
effect in possession or enjoyment. The distribution date need 642
not occur at the beginning or end of a calendar day but may 643
occur at a time during the course of a day. 644
(5) "Future interest" means an alternative future interest 645
or a future interest in the form of a class gift. 646

or a transfer to an existing trust, or by an exercise of a power 649
of appointment to an existing trust, that directs the 650
continuance of an existing trust, designates a beneficiary of an 651
existing trust, or creates a trust. 652
(7) "Per stirpes" means that the shares of the descendants 653
of a beneficiary who does not survive the distribution date by 654
at least one hundred twenty hours are determined in the same way 655
they would have been determined under division (A) of section 656
2105.06 of the Revised Code if the beneficiary had died 657
intestate and unmarried on the distribution date. 658
(8) "Revocable trust" means a trust that was revocable 659
immediately before the settlor's death by the settlor alone or 660
by the settlor with the consent of any person other than a 661
person holding an adverse interest. A trust's characterization 662
as revocable is not affected by the settlor's lack of capacity 663
to exercise the power of revocation, regardless of whether an 664
agent of the settlor under a power of attorney, or a guardian of 665
the person or estate of the settlor, was serving. 666
(9) "Stepchild" means a child of the surviving, deceased, 667
or former spouse of the transferor and not of the transferor. 668

(b) The testator, if the future interest was devised by 673
will; 674
(c) The settlor, if the future interest was conveyed by 675
inter vivos trust. 676

As Introduced
(B)(1)(a) As used in "surviving descendants" in divisions 677
(B)(2)(b)(i) and (ii) of this section, "descendants" means the 678
descendants of a deceased beneficiary or class member who would 679
take under a class gift created in the trust. 680
(b) As used in divisions (B)(2)(b)(i) and (ii) of this 681
section, "surviving beneficiaries" or "surviving descendants" 682
means beneficiaries or descendants, whichever is applicable, who 683
survive the distribution date by at least one hundred twenty 684
hours. 685
(2) Unless a contrary intent appears in the instrument 686
creating a future interest under the terms of a trust, each of 687
the following applies: 688
(a) A future interest under the terms of a trust is 689
contingent on the beneficiary's surviving the distribution date 690
by at least one hundred twenty hours. 691
(b) If a beneficiary of a future interest under the terms 692
of a trust does not survive the distribution date by at least 693
one hundred twenty hours and if the beneficiary is a grandparent 694
of the transferor, a descendant of a grandparent of the 695
transferor, or a stepchild of the transferor, either of the 696
following applies: 697
(i) If the future interest is not in the form of a class 698
gift and the deceased beneficiary leaves surviving descendants, 699
a substitute gift is created in the beneficiary's surviving 700
descendants. The surviving descendants take, per stirpes, the 701
property to which the beneficiary would have been entitled had 702
the beneficiary survived the distribution date by at least one 703
hundred twenty hours. 704
(ii) If the future interest is in the form of a class 705

gift, other than a future interest to "issue," "descendants," 706
"heirs of the body," "heirs," "next of kin," "relatives," or 707
"family," or a class described by language of similar import 708
that includes more than one generation, a substitute gift is 709
created in the surviving descendants of the deceased beneficiary 710
or beneficiaries. The property to which the beneficiaries would 711
have been entitled had all of them survived the distribution 712
date by at least one hundred twenty hours passes to the 713
surviving beneficiaries and the surviving descendants of the 714
deceased beneficiaries. Each surviving beneficiary takes the 715
share to which the surviving beneficiary would have been 716
entitled had the deceased beneficiaries survived the 717
distribution date by at least one hundred twenty hours. Each 718
deceased beneficiary's surviving descendants who are substituted 719
for the deceased beneficiary take, per stirpes, the share to 720
which the deceased beneficiary would have been entitled had the 721
deceased beneficiary survived the distribution date by at least 722
one hundred twenty hours. For purposes of division (B)(2)(b)(ii) 723
of this section, "deceased beneficiary" means a class member who 724
failed to survive the distribution date by at least one hundred 725
twenty hours and left one or more surviving descendants. 726
(C) For purposes of this section, each of the following 727
applies: 728
(1) Describing a class of beneficiaries as "surviving" or 729
"living," without specifying when the beneficiaries must be 730
surviving or living, such as a gift "for my spouse for life, 731
then to my surviving (or living) children," is not, in the 732
absence of other language in the trust instrument or other 733
evidence to the contrary, a sufficient indication of an intent 734
to negate the application of division (B)(2)(b) of this section. 735

H. B. No. 446 Page 27
As Introduced
(2) Subject to division (C)(1) of this section, attaching 736
words of survivorship to a future interest under the terms of a 737
trust, such as "for my spouse for life, then to my children who 738
survive my spouse" or "for my spouse for life, then to my then- 739
living children" is, in the absence of other language in the 740
trust instrument or other evidence to the contrary, a sufficient 741
indication of an intent to negate the application of division 742
(B)(2)(b) of this section. Words of survivorship under division 743
(C)(2) of this section include words of survivorship that relate 744
to the distribution date or to an earlier or an unspecified 745
time, whether those words of survivorship are expressed as 746
condition-precedent, condition-subsequent, or in any other form. 747
(3) A residuary clause in a will is not a sufficient 748
indication of an intent that is contrary to the application of 749
this section, whether or not the will specifically provides that 750
lapsed or failed devises are to pass under the residuary clause. 751
A residuary clause in a revocable trust instrument is not a 752
sufficient indication of an intent that is contrary to the 753
application of this section unless the distribution date is the 754
date of the settlor's death and the revocable trust instrument 755
specifically provides that upon lapse or failure the 756
nonresiduary devise, or nonresiduary devises in general, pass 757
under the residuary clause. 758
(D) If, after the application of divisions (B) and (C) of 759
this section there is no surviving taker of the property, and a 760
contrary intent does not appear in the instrument creating the 761
future interest, the property passes in the following order: 762
(1) If the future interest was created by the exercise of 763
a power of appointment, the property passes under the donor's 764
gift-in-default clause, if any, which clause is treated as 765

H. B. No. 446 Page 28
As Introduced
creating a future interest under the terms of a trust. 766
(2) If no taker is produced under division (D)(1) of this 767
section and the trust was created in a nonresiduary devise in 768
the transferor's will or in a codicil to the transferor's will, 769
the property passes under the residuary clause in the 770
transferor's will. For purposes of division (D)(2) of this 771
section, the residuary clause is treated as creating a future 772
interest under the terms of a trust. 773
(3) If no taker is produced under divisions (D)(1) and (2) 774
of this section, the transferor is deceased, and the trust was 775
created in a nonresiduary gift under the terms of a revocable 776
trust of the transferor, the property passes under the residuary 777
clause in the transferor's revocable trust instrument. For 778
purposes of division (D)(3) of this section, the residuary 779
clause in the transferor's revocable trust instrument is treated 780
as creating a future interest under the terms of a trust. 781
(4) If no taker is produced under divisions (D)(1), (2), 782
and (3) of this section, the property passes to those persons 783
who would succeed to the transferor's intestate estate and in 784
the shares as provided in the intestate succession law of the 785
transferor's domicile if the transferor died on the distribution 786
date. Notwithstanding division (A)(10) of this section, for 787
purposes of division (D)(4) of this section, if the future 788
interest was created by the exercise of a power of appointment, 789
"transferor" means the donor if the power is a nongeneral power, 790
or the donee if the power is a general power. 791
(E) This section applies to all trusts that become 792
irrevocable on or after March 22, 2012. This section does not 793
apply to any trust that was irrevocable before March 22, 2012, 794
even if property was added to the trust on or after March 22, 795

implementing or complying with a trust directive to the extent 812
that the relief meets any of the following criteria: 813
(1) The relief is permitted or allowed by Chapter 5818. of 814
the Revised Code. 815
(2) The relief is authorized by any term of a trust that 816
is permitted or allowed by Chapter 5818. of the Revised Code. 817

by divisions (A) and (B) of this section. 1385
Sec. 5818.21. This chapter does not apply to any exercise 1386
or nonexercise of a power or authority by either of the 1387
following: 1388
(A) A settlor, if the power or authority is conferred on 1389
or retained by the settlor, in the capacity of a settlor, 1390
pursuant to the terms of a trust; 1391
(B) A beneficiary, if the power or authority is conferred 1392
on the beneficiary, in the capacity of a beneficiary, pursuant 1393
to the terms of a trust. 1394
Sec. 5818.22. (A) A court shall consider both of the 1395
following factors in determining whether a person is acting in 1396
that person's capacity as a settlor, beneficiary, or protector: 1397
(1) The terms of a trust; 1398
(2) Any documents or communications regarding the person's 1399
exercise or nonexercise of a power or authority. 1400
(B) A court shall presume that the capacity asserted or 1401
identified by the person in a document is correctly asserted or 1402
identified when all of the following conditions are met: 1403
(1) The person executes the document. 1404
(2) The document specifies the capacity in which a person 1405
acts. 1406
(3) The terms of a trust grant the person the capacity 1407
specified in the document. 1408
(C) If a person's capacity as settlor, beneficiary, or 1409
protector is unclear after applying the factors provided in 1410
divisions (A) and (B) of this section, then a court may consider 1411

H. B. No. 446 Page 51
As Introduced
any other facts or circumstances that may be relevant to 1412
determining the capacity in which the person is acting. 1413
Sec. 5818.23. In addition to any other rights conferred 1414
upon a trust officeholder by this chapter or by the terms of a 1415
trust, a trust officeholder may ask a person that issues a 1416
communication or instruction to clarify whether that 1417
communication or instruction was issued in that person's 1418
capacity as a settlor, beneficiary, or trust officeholder. If a 1419
person purports to issue a communication or instruction in that 1420
person's capacity as a trust officeholder, then any other trust 1421
officeholder receiving the communication or instruction may ask 1422
the issuer to specify the official capacity in which the issuer 1423
is acting. 1424
Sec. 5818.24. To the maximum extent allowed by the Ohio 1425
Constitution and the United States Constitution, the courts of 1426
this state have personal jurisdiction over a person who accepts 1427
an appointment to serve as a protector of a trust subject to 1428
this chapter. 1429
Sec. 5818.25. (A) No beneficiary shall commence a 1430
proceeding against a protector for breach of trust, based on 1431
acts or omissions undertaken by the protector in a fiduciary 1432
capacity, more than two years after the date that a beneficiary, 1433
a representative of a beneficiary, or a beneficiary surrogate is 1434
sent a report or accounting that adequately discloses the 1435
existence of a potential claim for breach of trust and informs 1436
the beneficiary, representative, or surrogate of the time 1437
allowed for commencing a proceeding against the protector. 1438
(B) If a claim is brought against a protector regarding 1439
acts or omissions undertaken by the protector in a nonfiduciary 1440
capacity, or for causes of action other than breach of trust, 1441

H. B. No. 446 Page 52
As Introduced
then the action must be commenced within the same limitation 1442
period that would otherwise apply to that claim. 1443
Sec. 5818.26. Nothing in this chapter requires a trust to 1444
have a protector, and the terms of a trust may omit any 1445
requirement for or reference to a protector. 1446
Sec. 5818.27. (A) The terms of a trust may set forth 1447
reasonable procedures for the issuance or delivery of a trust 1448
directive, or any other document related to or arising out of 1449
any of the following: 1450
(1) The implementation of a trust directive; 1451
(2) A protector's exercise or nonexercise of the 1452
protector's rights, powers, authority, or discretion; 1453
(3) Any other matter related to or arising out of such 1454
protector's duties, liabilities, or service as protector. 1455
(B) The terms of a trust concerning the issuance or 1456
delivery of any item described in division (A) of this section 1457
are presumed to be both reasonable and the exclusive means for 1458
such issuance or delivery. The presumptions set forth in this 1459
division may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence. 1460
Nothing in this division shall be construed to impair, limit, or 1461
restrict a trust officeholder's rights to do any of the 1462
following: 1463
(1) Seek clarification of a trust directive from a 1464
protector or request that the protector put the trust directive 1465
in writing pursuant to section 5818.15 of the Revised Code; 1466
(2) Seek judicial instructions pursuant to section 5818.16 1467
of the Revised Code; 1468
(3) Ask a person to clarify the capacity in which such 1469

H. B. No. 446 Page 53
As Introduced
person is acting pursuant to section 5818.23 of the Revised 1470
Code. 1471
(C) If the terms of a trust do not set forth reasonable 1472
procedures for the issuance or delivery of any item described in 1473
division (A) of this section, or if the terms of a trust provide 1474
that those reasonable procedures are nonexhaustive, then any 1475
such item may be issued or delivered by any method that is 1476
consistent with section 5801.08 of the Revised Code. 1477
Sec. 5818.28. (A) A person designated as a protector of a 1478
trust may accept such designation by complying with a method of 1479
acceptance provided in the terms of the trust, exercising powers 1480
or performing duties of the protector, or otherwise indicating 1481
acceptance of the office and responsibilities of the protector. 1482
(B) A person designated as a protector who has not yet 1483
accepted may reject the designation. A designated protector who 1484
does not accept within a reasonable time after knowing of the 1485
designation is deemed to have rejected the designation. 1486
Sec. 5818.29. All of the following apply to a trust excep t 1487
to the extent that the terms of the trust provide otherwise: 1488
(A) A protector shall give bond to secure performance of 1489
the protector's duties only if the court finds that a bond is 1490
needed to protect the interests of the beneficiaries or is 1491
required by the terms of the trust and the court has not 1492
dispensed with the requirement. 1493
(B) The court may specify the amount of a bond, its 1494
liabilities, and whether sureties are necessary. The court may 1495
modify or terminate a bond at any time. 1496
(C) A regulated financial-service institution or licensed 1497
trust company qualified to do trust business in this state need 1498

H. B. No. 446 Page 54

not give bond. 1499
Sec. 5818.30. Except as otherwise provided under the term s 1500
of the trust, a vacancy in a protector position occurs under any 1501
of the following circumstances: 1502
(A) A person designated as a protector rejects the 1503
designation. 1504
(B) A person designated as a protector cannot be 1505
identified or does not exist. 1506
(C) A protector resigns. 1507
(D) A protector is disqualified or removed. 1508
(E) A protector dies. 1509
(F) A guardian of the estate or person is appointed for an 1510
individual serving as a protector. 1511
Sec. 5818.31. (A) Except as otherwise provided under the 1512
terms of the trust, a protector may resign upon at least thirty 1513
days' notice to any person who is a qualified beneficiary as 1514
defined by section 5801.01 of the Revised Code, the settlor, if 1515
living, and all trustees, or with the approval of the court. 1516
(B) In approving a resignation of a protector, the court 1517
may issue orders and impose conditions reasonably necessary for 1518
the protection of the trust property. 1519
(C) Any liability of a resigning protector or of any 1520
sureties on the protector's bond for acts or omissions of the 1521
protector is not discharged or affected by the protector's 1522
resignation. 1523
Sec. 5818.32. Subject to the terms of a trust instrument, 1524
all of the following apply: 1525

H. B. No. 446 Page 55
As Introduced
(A) The settlor, a trustee, or a beneficiary may request 1526
the court to remove a protector, or the court may remove a 1527
protector on its own initiative. 1528
(B) The court may remove a protector for any of the 1529
following reasons: 1530
(1) The protector has committed a serious breach of trust, 1531
but only if the protector is a fiduciary. 1532
(2) Lack of cooperation among protectors substantially 1533
impairs the administration of the trust. 1534
(3) Because of unfitness, willful misconduct, or 1535
unwillingness to serve as protector, the court determines that 1536
removal of the protector best serves the interests of the 1537
beneficiaries. 1538
(4) If the protector is a fiduciary, because of persistent 1539
failure of the protector to discharge the duties imposed on the 1540
protector by the trust instrument, the court determines that 1541
removal of the protector best serves the interests of the 1542
beneficiaries. 1543
(C) Pending a final decision on a request to remove a 1544
protector, or in lieu of or in addition to removing a protector, 1545
the court may do any of the following, as necessary to protect 1546
the trust property or the interests of the beneficiaries: 1547
(1) Compel the protector to perform the protector's 1548
duties; 1549
(2) Enjoin the protector from engaging in acts of willful 1550
misconduct; 1551
(3) If the protector is a fiduciary, enjoin the protector 1552
from committing a breach of trust; 1553

H. B. No. 446 Page 56
As Introduced

capacity, compel the protector to redress an act of willful 1555
misconduct by paying money, restoring property, or other means; 1556
(5) If the protector is a fiduciary, compel the protector 1557
to redress a breach of trust by paying money, restoring 1558
property, or other means; 1559
(6) Order a protector to account; 1560
(7) Appoint a special fiduciary to take possession of any 1561
trust property held by the protector; 1562
(8) Suspend the protector; 1563
(9) Reduce or deny compensation to the protector; 1564
(10) Void an act of the protector, impose a lien or a 1565
constructive trust on any trust property held by the protector, 1566
or trace trust property wrongfully disposed of by the protector 1567
and recover the property or its proceeds; 1568
(11) Order any other appropriate relief. 1569
Sec. 5818.33. (A) If the terms of a trust do not specify 1570
the protector's compensation, a protector is entitled to 1571
compensation that is reasonable under the circumstances. 1572
(B) If the terms of a trust specify the protector's 1573
compensation, the protector is entitled to be compensated as 1574
specified, but the court may allow more or less compensation if 1575
the duties of the protector are substantially different from 1576
those contemplated when the trust was created or the 1577
compensation specified by the terms of the trust would be 1578
unreasonably low or high. 1579
