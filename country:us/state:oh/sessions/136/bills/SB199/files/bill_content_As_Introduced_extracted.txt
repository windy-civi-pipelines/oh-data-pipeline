the tax or fee levied under section 5753.02 or , 5753.021, or 692

proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax or fee 694
are instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a 695
jeopardy assessment against the taxpayer that is liable for the 696
tax or fee. Immediately upon the issuance of a jeopardy 697
assessment, the tax commissioner shall file an entry with the 698
clerk of the court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by 699
division (A)(4) of this section, and the clerk shall proceed as 700

agent under section 5703.37 of the Revised Code within five days 703

assessed files a petition for reassessment under division (A)(2) 706
of this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to 707
the tax commissioner that is in an amount sufficient to satisfy 708
the unpaid balance of the assessment. If a petition for 709
reassessment has been filed, and if satisfactory security has 710
been provided, the tax commissioner shall proceed under division 711
(A)(3) of this section. Full or partial payment of the 712

Revised Code exceeds the amount the taxpayer paid, the tax 735
commissioner may audit a sample of the taxpayer's gross casino 736
revenue or sports gaming receipts, as applicable, over a 737
representative period of time to ascertain the amount of tax or 738
fees due, and may issue an assessment based on the audit. The 739
tax commissioner shall make a good faith effort to reach 740
agreement with the taxpayer in selecting a representative 741
sample. The tax commissioner may apply a sampling method only if 742
the tax commissioner has prescribed the method by rule. 743
(F) If the whereabouts of a taxpayer who is liable for the 744
tax or fee levied under section 5753.02 or , 5753.021, or 745
