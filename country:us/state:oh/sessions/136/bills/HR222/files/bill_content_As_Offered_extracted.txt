WHEREAS, The Barnesville State Theater has become one of the most 4
esteemed and prized landmarks in the area, and congratulations are in 5

venue for live shows and movies, it closed in 1969 and later housed a 7
carpet store and then a thrift store before falling into disrepair, 8

preserved and protected for the benefit of future generations; and 19
WHEREAS, The Barnesville State Theater has had a significant 20
impact on the area, and all those involved in the restoration and 21
maintenance of the building are to be applauded for their vision and 22
enthusiasm in working to preserve not only a fine structure but a 23
vital piece of the community’s heritage. As they commemorate the 24
theater’s One Hundredth Anniversary, they can reflect with pride on 25
its exciting past and look forward to a prosperous future; therefore 26
