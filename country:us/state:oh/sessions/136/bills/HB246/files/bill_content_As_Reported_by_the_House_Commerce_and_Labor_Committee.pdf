Revised Code during that period. 286
(C)(1) The director shall maintain a list of all 287

Sec. 4151.06. (A) If a court, pursuant to an action 305

court shall order each appropriate agency to permanently revoke 309
any license issued by the agency and held by the nonresidential 310
construction contractor, subcontractor, or labor broker specific 311
to the business location where the unauthorized alien performed 312
work. If the nonresidential construction contractor, 313

Sub. H. B. No. 246 Page 12
As Reported by the House Commerce and Labor Committee
subcontractor, or labor broker does not hold a license specific 314
to the business location where the unauthorized alien performed 315
work, but a license is necessary to operate the nonresidential 316
construction contractor's, subcontractor's, or labor broker's 317
business in general, the court shall order the appropriate 318
agency to permanently revoke all licenses issued by that agency 319
that are held by the nonresidential construction contractor, 320
subcontractor, or labor broker at the nonresidential 321
construction contractor's, subcontractor's, or labor broker's 322
primary place of business. On receipt of the order and 323
notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the appropriate 324
agency immediately shall revoke the licenses. 325

unauthorized alien, a court shall consider only a determination 327
with respect to that alien's immigration status made by the 328
federal government pursuant to the federal "Omnibus Consolidated 329
Appropriations Act, 1997," 8 U.S.C. 1373(c). The federal 330
government's determination creates a rebuttable presumption of 331
the alien's lawful status. The court may take judicial notice of 332
the federal government's determination and may request the 333
federal government to provide automated or testimonial 334
verification pursuant to the federal "Omnibus Consolidated 335
Appropriations Act, 1997," 8 U.S.C. 1373(c). 336

Code. 341

Sub. H. B. No. 246 Page 13
As Reported by the House Commerce and Labor Committee
within their contracts for the construction or renovation of 344
nonresidential construction projects provisions that comply with 345
division (A) of this section. 346
(C) The attorney general shall notify a state agency and 347
the director of administrative services of any contract for the 348
construction or renovation of a nonresidential construction 349
project the attorney general determines violates division (A) of 350
this section. In the notice, the attorney general shall inform 351
the state agency and the director of the state agency's duty 352
under division (A) of this section. 353
(D) Each state agency found in violation of division (A) 354
of this section shall, for one year after the attorney general 355
provides the notice required under division (C) of this section, 356
submit any contract for the construction or renovation of a 357
nonresidential construction project to the director of 358
administrative services. The director shall promptly review the 359
proposed contract and determine whether the state agency 360
complied with division (A) of this section. The director shall 361
notify the agency of the director's determination and, in the 362
event the proposed contract does not contain the required 363
provisions, instruct the state agency to include the provisions 364
in a revised draft of the proposed contract. 365
