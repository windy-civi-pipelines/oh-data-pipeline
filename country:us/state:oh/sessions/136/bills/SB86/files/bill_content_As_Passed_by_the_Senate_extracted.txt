applied in partial satisfaction of the debt. If the amount 1061
refundable is greater than the amount of the debt, the amount 1062
remaining after satisfaction of the debt shall be refunded. This 1063

(B) Unless the person assessed, within sixty days after 1079
service of the notice of assessment, files with the 1080
commissioner, either personally or by certified mail, a written 1081
petition signed by the person or the person's authorized agent 1082
having knowledge of the facts, the assessment becomes final, and 1083
the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the person 1084
assessed to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate 1085
the objections of the person assessed, but additional objections 1086
may be raised in writing if received by the commissioner before 1087
the date shown on the final determination. 1088
If a petition for reassessment has been properly filed, 1089
the commissioner shall proceed under section 5703.60 of the 1090
Revised Code. 1091
(C)(1) After an assessment becomes final, if any portion 1092
of the assessment, including accrued interest, remains unpaid, a 1093
certified copy of the commissioner's entry making the assessment 1094
final may be filed in the office of the clerk of the court of 1095
common pleas in the county in which the person resides or has 1096
its principal place of business in this state, or in the office 1097

(2) Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk 1099
shall enter judgment for the state against the person assessed 1100
in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment may be filed by 1101
the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for 1102
the intoxicating hemp product receipts tax" or "special 1103
judgments for the drinkable cannabinoid product tax," as 1104
Sub. S. B. No. 86 Page 40

applicable, and shall have the same effect as other judgments. 1105
Execution shall issue upon the judgment at the request of the 1106
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution 1107
shall apply to sales made under the judgment. 1108
(3) If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within 1109
sixty days after the day the assessment was issued, the portion 1110
of the assessment consisting of tax due shall bear interest at 1111
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised 1112
Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until 1113
it is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for 1114
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever 1115
comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is 1116
certified to the attorney general for collection, the entire 1117
unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at the rate 1118
per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from 1119
the date of certification until the date it is paid in its 1120

Code, as applicable, and may be collected by the issuance of an 1123
assessment under this section. 1124

the person liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of 1129
the jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry 1130
with the clerk of the court of common pleas in the manner 1131
prescribed by division (C) of this section. Notice of the 1132
jeopardy assessment shall be served on the person assessed or 1133
the person's authorized agent in the manner provided in section 1134

Section 54:
5703.37 of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of 1135
Sub. S. B. No. 86 Page 41
As Passed by the Senate
the entry with the clerk. The total amount assessed is 1136
immediately due and payable unless the person assessed files a 1137
petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of 1138
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the 1139
commissioner and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid 1140
balance of the assessment. Full or partial payment of the 1141
assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's consideration 1142
of the petition for reassessment. 1143
(E) The commissioner shall immediately forward to the 1144
treasurer of state all amounts the commissioner receives under 1145
this section, and such amounts shall be considered as revenue 1146

the tax was reported, or more than four years after the return 1153
for the tax period was filed, whichever is later. The time limit 1154
may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner 1155
consent in writing to the extension or enter into an agreement 1156
waiving or extending the time limit. Any such extension shall 1157
extend the four-year time limit in division (A) of section 1158

Section 56:
3779.43 of the Revised Code for the same period of time. Nothing 1159
in this division bars an assessment against a taxpayer that 1160
fails to file a return required under section 3779.41 of the 1161
Revised Code or that files a fraudulent return. 1162
(G) If the commissioner possesses information that 1163
indicates that the amount of tax a taxpayer is required to pay 1164
under division (B) or (C) of section 3779.40 of the Revised Code 1165
Sub. S. B. No. 86 Page 42
As Passed by the Senate
exceeds the amount the taxpayer paid, the commissioner may audit 1166
a sample of the taxpayer's sales over a representative period of 1167
time to ascertain the amount of tax due, and may issue an 1168
assessment based on the audit. The commissioner shall make a 1169
good faith effort to reach agreement with the taxpayer in 1170
selecting a representative sample. The commissioner may apply a 1171
sampling method only if the commissioner has prescribed the 1172
method by rule. 1173
(H) If the whereabouts of a person subject to this chapter 1174
is not known to the tax commissioner, the commissioner shall 1175
follow the procedures under section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. 1176
Sec. 3779.45. If any person liable for a tax imposed unde r 1177

Section 57:
section 3779.40 of the Revised Code sells the trade or business, 1178
disposes in any manner other than in the regular course of 1179
business at least seventy-five per cent of assets of the trade 1180
or business, or quits the trade or business, any tax owed by 1181
such person shall become due and payable immediately, and the 1182
person shall pay the tax due under this chapter, including any 1183
applicable penalties and interest, within forty-five days after 1184
the date of selling or quitting the trade or business. The 1185
person's successor shall withhold a sufficient amount of the 1186
purchase money to cover the amount due and unpaid until the 1187
former owner produces a receipt from the tax commissioner 1188
showing that the amounts are paid or a certificate indicating 1189
that no tax is due. If a purchaser fails to withhold purchase 1190
money, that person is personally liable, up to the purchase 1191
money amount, for such amounts that are unpaid during the 1192
operation of the business by the former owner. 1193
The commissioner may adopt rules regarding the issuance of 1194
certificates under this section, including the waiver of the 1195

need for a certificate if certain criteria are met. 1196

under division (B) of section 3779.40 of the Revised Code fails 1198
to report or pay the tax as required under section 3779.41 of 1199
the Revised Code, or fails to pay any penalty imposed under 1200

Section 58:
sections 3779.40 to 3779.48 of the Revised Code within ninety 1201
days after the time prescribed for payment of the penalty, the 1202
attorney general, on the request of the tax commissioner, shall 1203
commence an action in quo warranto in the court of appeals of 1204
the county in which the person resides or has its principal 1205
place of business to forfeit and annul the person's licenses 1206
issued under Chapter 3780. or 3796. of the Revised Code. If the 1207
court finds that the person is in default for the amount 1208
claimed, it shall render judgment revoking the person's 1209
registration and shall otherwise proceed as provided in Chapter 1210

Section 59:
2733. of the Revised Code. 1211
Sec. 3779.46. (A) The tax commissioner may prescribe 1212

documents, the filing of copies of federal income tax returns 1214
and determinations, and computations reconciling federal income 1215

Revised Code. The commissioner may require any person, by rule 1217

commissioner considers necessary to show whether, and the extent 1219
to which, a person is subject to a tax levied under section 1220

commissioner, either personally or by certified mail, a written 1081
petition signed by the person or the person's authorized agent 1082

the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the person 1084
assessed to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate 1085
the objections of the person assessed, but additional objections 1086
may be raised in writing if received by the commissioner before 1087
the date shown on the final determination. 1088
If a petition for reassessment has been properly filed, 1089

Execution shall issue upon the judgment at the request of the 1106
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution 1107
shall apply to sales made under the judgment. 1108

sixty days after the day the assessment was issued, the portion 1110
of the assessment consisting of tax due shall bear interest at 1111
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised 1112
Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until 1113
it is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for 1114
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever 1115
comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is 1116
certified to the attorney general for collection, the entire 1117

the person liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of 1129
the jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry 1130
with the clerk of the court of common pleas in the manner 1131
prescribed by division (C) of this section. Notice of the 1132

the entry with the clerk. The total amount assessed is 1136
immediately due and payable unless the person assessed files a 1137
petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of 1138
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the 1139
commissioner and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid 1140
balance of the assessment. Full or partial payment of the 1141
assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's consideration 1142
of the petition for reassessment. 1143

(C) The records described in divisions (A) and (B) of this 1232
section and other documents shall be open during business hours 1233

consents to their destruction within that period, or by order 1236

may enter and inspect the facilities and records of a person 1259
selling intoxicating hemp products or drinkable cannabinoid 1260

issued search warrant if conducted outside the normal business 1262
hours of the person, but does not require a search warrant if 1263

person shall prevent or hinder the commissioner or an agent of 1265
the commissioner from carrying out the authority granted under 1266

commissioner shall pay the costs incurred in the seizure and 1276
sale, and any proceeds remaining after the sale shall be 1277
