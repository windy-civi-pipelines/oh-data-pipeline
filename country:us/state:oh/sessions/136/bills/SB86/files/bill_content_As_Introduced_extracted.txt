commissioner, either personally or by certified mail, a written 1168
petition signed by the person or the person's authorized agent 1169

assessed to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate 1172
the objections of the person assessed, but additional objections 1173

sixty days after the day the assessment was issued, the portion 1197
of the assessment consisting of tax due shall bear interest at 1198
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised 1199
Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until 1200

unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at the rate 1205
per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from 1206

the person's authorized agent in the manner provided in section 1221

Section 58:
5703.37 of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of 1222
the entry with the clerk. The total amount assessed is 1223

petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of 1225
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the 1226
commissioner and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid 1227
balance of the assessment. Full or partial payment of the 1228
assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's consideration 1229
of the petition for reassessment. 1230
(E) The commissioner shall immediately forward to the 1231
treasurer of state all amounts the commissioner receives under 1232
this section, and such amounts shall be considered as revenue 1233

may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner 1242
consent in writing to the extension or enter into an agreement 1243
waiving or extending the time limit. Any such extension shall 1244
extend the four-year time limit in division (A) of section 1245

exceeds the amount the taxpayer paid, the commissioner may audit 1253
a sample of the taxpayer's sales over a representative period of 1254
time to ascertain the amount of tax due, and may issue an 1255
assessment based on the audit. The commissioner shall make a 1256

selecting a representative sample. The commissioner may apply a 1258

board of tax appeals or a court, or, if applicable, upon 149
decision of the United States supreme court. 150
For the purposes of division (F)(3) of this section, an 151
initial action to collect a tax debt is commenced at the time 152
when a certified copy of the tax commissioner's entry making an 153
assessment final has been filed in the office of the clerk of 154

claimed, the commissioner shall certify the amount to the 1118

If a taxpayer entitled to a refund under section 3779.43 1144
of the Revised Code owes any debt to this state, the amount 1145
refundable may be applied in satisfaction of the debt. If the 1146
amount refundable is less than the amount of the debt, it may be 1147
applied in partial satisfaction of the debt. If the amount 1148
refundable is greater than the amount of the debt, the amount 1149
remaining after satisfaction of the debt shall be refunded. This 1150
section applies only to debts that have become final. For the 1151
purposes of this section, a debt becomes final when, under the 1152
applicable law, any time provided for petition for reassessment, 1153
request for reconsideration, or other appeal of the legality or 1154

The commissioner shall give the person assessed written notice 1161
of the assessment as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised 1162
Code. With the notice, the commissioner shall provide 1163
instructions on the manner in which to petition for reassessment 1164
and request a hearing with respect to the petition. 1165
(B) Unless the person assessed, within sixty days after 1166
service of the notice of assessment, files with the 1167
commissioner, either personally or by certified mail, a written 1168
petition signed by the person or the person's authorized agent 1169
having knowledge of the facts, the assessment becomes final, and 1170
the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the person 1171
assessed to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate 1172
the objections of the person assessed, but additional objections 1173
may be raised in writing if received by the commissioner before 1174
the date shown on the final determination. 1175
If a petition for reassessment has been properly filed, 1176
the commissioner shall proceed under section 5703.60 of the 1177
Revised Code. 1178
(C)(1) After an assessment becomes final, if any portion 1179
of the assessment, including accrued interest, remains unpaid, a 1180
certified copy of the commissioner's entry making the assessment 1181
final may be filed in the office of the clerk of the court of 1182
common pleas in the county in which the person resides or has 1183
its principal place of business in this state, or in the office 1184

shall enter judgment for the state against the person assessed 1187
in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment may be filed by 1188
the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for 1189
the intoxicating hemp product receipts tax" or "special 1190
judgments for the drinkable cannabinoid product tax," as 1191
applicable, and shall have the same effect as other judgments. 1192
Execution shall issue upon the judgment at the request of the 1193
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution 1194
shall apply to sales made under the judgment. 1195
(3) If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within 1196
sixty days after the day the assessment was issued, the portion 1197
of the assessment consisting of tax due shall bear interest at 1198
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised 1199
Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until 1200
it is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for 1201
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever 1202
comes first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is 1203
certified to the attorney general for collection, the entire 1204
unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at the rate 1205
per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from 1206
the date of certification until the date it is paid in its 1207
entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax 1208
imposed by division (B) or (C) of section 3779.40 of the Revised 1209
Code, as applicable, and may be collected by the issuance of an 1210
assessment under this section. 1211
(D) If the commissioner believes that collection of a tax 1212
imposed by this chapter will be jeopardized unless proceedings 1213
to collect or secure collection of the tax is instituted without 1214
delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment against 1215
the person liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of 1216
the jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry 1217

S. B. No. 86 Page 44

with the clerk of the court of common pleas in the manner 1218
prescribed by division (C) of this section. Notice of the 1219
jeopardy assessment shall be served on the person assessed or 1220
the person's authorized agent in the manner provided in section 1221
5703.37 of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of 1222
the entry with the clerk. The total amount assessed is 1223
immediately due and payable unless the person assessed files a 1224
petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of 1225
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the 1226
commissioner and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid 1227
balance of the assessment. Full or partial payment of the 1228
assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's consideration 1229
of the petition for reassessment. 1230
(E) The commissioner shall immediately forward to the 1231
treasurer of state all amounts the commissioner receives under 1232
this section, and such amounts shall be considered as revenue 1233
arising from the tax imposed under division (B) or (C) of 1234
section 3779.40 of the Revised Code, as applicable. 1235
(F) Except as otherwise provided in this division, no 1236

date for the filing of the return for the tax period for which 1239
the tax was reported, or more than four years after the return 1240
for the tax period was filed, whichever is later. The time limit 1241
may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner 1242
consent in writing to the extension or enter into an agreement 1243
waiving or extending the time limit. Any such extension shall 1244
extend the four-year time limit in division (A) of section 1245
3779.43 of the Revised Code for the same period of time. Nothing 1246
in this division bars an assessment against a taxpayer that 1247
fails to file a return required under section 3779.41 of the 1248

Revised Code or that files a fraudulent return. 1249

indicates that the amount of tax a taxpayer is required to pay 1251
under division (B) or (C) of section 3779.40 of the Revised Code 1252
exceeds the amount the taxpayer paid, the commissioner may audit 1253
a sample of the taxpayer's sales over a representative period of 1254
time to ascertain the amount of tax due, and may issue an 1255
assessment based on the audit. The commissioner shall make a 1256
good faith effort to reach agreement with the taxpayer in 1257
selecting a representative sample. The commissioner may apply a 1258
sampling method only if the commissioner has prescribed the 1259
method by rule. 1260
(H) If the whereabouts of a person subject to this chapter 1261
is not known to the tax commissioner, the commissioner shall 1262
follow the procedures under section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. 1263
Sec. 3779.45. If any person liable for a tax imposed unde r 1264
section 3779.40 of the Revised Code sells the trade or business, 1265
disposes in any manner other than in the regular course of 1266
business at least seventy-five per cent of assets of the trade 1267
or business, or quits the trade or business, any tax owed by 1268
such person shall become due and payable immediately, and the 1269
person shall pay the tax due under this chapter, including any 1270
applicable penalties and interest, within forty-five days after 1271
the date of selling or quitting the trade or business. The 1272
person's successor shall withhold a sufficient amount of the 1273
purchase money to cover the amount due and unpaid until the 1274
former owner produces a receipt from the tax commissioner 1275
showing that the amounts are paid or a certificate indicating 1276
that no tax is due. If a purchaser fails to withhold purchase 1277
money, that person is personally liable, up to the purchase 1278

operation of the business by the former owner. 1280
The commissioner may adopt rules regarding the issuance of 1281
certificates under this section, including the waiver of the 1282
need for a certificate if certain criteria are met. 1283
Sec. 3779.451. If any person subject to the tax levied 1284
under division (B) of section 3779.40 of the Revised Code fails 1285
to report or pay the tax as required under section 3779.41 of 1286
the Revised Code, or fails to pay any penalty imposed under 1287
sections 3779.40 to 3779.48 of the Revised Code within ninety 1288
days after the time prescribed for payment of the penalty, the 1289
attorney general, on the request of the tax commissioner, shall 1290
commence an action in quo warranto in the court of appeals of 1291
the county in which the person resides or has its principal 1292
place of business to forfeit and annul the person's licenses 1293
issued under Chapter 3780. or 3796. of the Revised Code. If the 1294
court finds that the person is in default for the amount 1295
claimed, it shall render judgment revoking the person's 1296
registration and shall otherwise proceed as provided in Chapter 1297
2733. of the Revised Code. 1298
Sec. 3779.46. (A) The tax commissioner may prescribe 1299
requirements for the keeping of records and other pertinent 1300
documents, the filing of copies of federal income tax returns 1301
and determinations, and computations reconciling federal income 1302
tax returns with the returns required by section 3779.41 of the 1303
Revised Code. The commissioner may require any person, by rule 1304
or notice served on that person, to keep those records that the 1305
commissioner considers necessary to show whether, and the extent 1306
to which, a person is subject to a tax levied under section 1307
3779.40 of the Revised Code. 1308

other documents relating to the sales and other dispositions of 1313
such products. No person shall make a false entry upon any 1314
invoice or record upon which an entry is required by this 1315
section, and no person shall present any false entry for the 1316
inspection of the commissioner with the intent to evade a tax 1317
levied under section 3779.40 of the Revised Code. 1318
(C) The records described in divisions (A) and (B) of this 1319
section and other documents shall be open during business hours 1320
to the inspection of the commissioner, and shall be preserved 1321
for a period of four years, unless the commissioner, in writing, 1322
consents to their destruction within that period, or by order 1323
requires that they be kept for a longer period. If such records 1324
are normally kept by the person electronically, the person shall 1325
provide such records to the commissioner electronically at the 1326
commissioner's request. 1327
(D) Any information acquired by the commissioner under 1328
this chapter is confidential as provided for in section 5703.21 1329

selling intoxicating hemp products or drinkable cannabinoid 1342
products, with the intent to avoid payment of a tax levied by 1343

(B) The tax commissioner or an agent of the commissioner 1345
may enter and inspect the facilities and records of a person 1346
selling intoxicating hemp products or drinkable cannabinoid 1347
products. Such entrance and inspection requires a properly 1348
issued search warrant if conducted outside the normal business 1349
hours of the person, but does not require a search warrant if 1350
conducted during the normal business hours of the person. No 1351
person shall prevent or hinder the commissioner or an agent of 1352
the commissioner from carrying out the authority granted under 1353
this division. 1354
(C) Whenever the commissioner discovers intoxicating hemp 1355
products or drinkable cannabinoid products that are subject to a 1356
tax levied by this chapter and upon which the tax has not been 1357
paid or the commissioner has reason to believe the tax is being 1358
avoided, the commissioner may seize and take possession of the 1359
products, which, upon seizure, shall be forfeited to the state. 1360
Within a reasonable time after seizure, the commissioner may 1361
sell the products. From the proceeds of this sale, the 1362
commissioner shall pay the costs incurred in the seizure and 1363
sale, and any proceeds remaining after the sale shall be 1364
considered as revenue arising from the tax. The seizure and sale 1365
do not relieve any person from the fine or imprisonment provided 1366
for a violation of this chapter. The commissioner shall make the 1367
sale where it is most convenient and economical, but may order 1368
the destruction of forfeited products if the quantity or quality 1369
