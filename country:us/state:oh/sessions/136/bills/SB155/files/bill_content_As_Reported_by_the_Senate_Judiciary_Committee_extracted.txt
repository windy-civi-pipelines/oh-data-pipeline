fee, commission, or other valuable consideration, or with the 305
intention, in the expectation, or upon the promise of receiving 306
or collecting a fee, commission, or other valuable 307
consideration, enters into a purchase contract for residential 308
real property either: 309
(i) As the grantee, and assigns or novates that contract 310
to another person or entity; 311
S. B. No. 155 Page 12
As Reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee
(ii) As the grantor, and, without holding legal title to 312
that real property, assigns or novates that contract to another 313
person or entity. 314
(b) "Wholesaler" does not include either of the following: 315
(i) An individual who assigns or novates a contract 316
described in division (A)(2)(a) of this section to another 317
individual who is related by blood. 318
(ii) A person or entity that assigns or novates such a 319
contract to a parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or affiliated group 320
under common control with the person or entity. 321
(B)(1) Before entering into a binding contract that 322
transfers an interest in residential real property, a wholesaler 323
acting as the grantee or the wholesaler's representative, if 324
applicable, shall provide to the record owner a conspicuous 325
written disclosure statement, separate from the purchase 326
contract or agreement, printed in boldface type in a font size 327
not less than twelve points, and in substantially the following 328
form: 329
"Ohio law requires a wholesaler acting as a grantee, 330
before entering into a contract or agreement that conveys an 331
interest in residential real property, to provide certain 332
information to the record owner in a conspicuous manner printed 333
in boldface type in a font size not less than twelve points. 334
Failure by a wholesaler to present or complete this form is an 335
unfair or deceptive act or practice. Any person who enters into 336
an agreement that conveys an interest in residential real 337
property to a wholesaler acting as a grantee without receiving 338
this disclosure has a cause of action against the wholesaler. A 339
wholesaler acting as a grantee is prohibited from entering into 340
S. B. No. 155 Page 13
As Reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee
a binding contract to acquire an interest in residential real 341
property unless this statement is signed and dated by the record 342
owner of the property. 343
The owner acknowledges that the person presenting this 344
document is a wholesaler, as defined by section 5301.95 of the 345
Revised Code, and that the owner is advised to seek legal advice 346
before entering into any agreement or contract with the 347
wholesaler. A wholesaler is acting on the wholesaler's own 348
behalf and does not represent the owner in this transaction. A 349
wholesaler enters assignable contracts with owners and seeks to 350
sell or assign the wholesaler's interest for a profit. The 351
wholesaler may assign the wholesaler's interest in the purchase 352
contract to a third party without the owner's consent before 353
closing. The wholesaler may charge a fee to the third-party 354
buyer separately for profit. The agreed purchase price between 355
the owner and wholesaler may be below market value and is 356
conveyed voluntarily. 357
The owner acknowledges disclosure of the information 358
provided in this form by signing and dating below: 359
_______________ (Property owner signature) ______ (date) 360
_______________ (Wholesaler signature) _____ (date)" 361
(2) A wholesaler acting as the grantee shall not enter 362
into a binding contract that transfers an interest in 363
residential real property until both the wholesaler and the 364
record owner of the property sign and date the disclosure 365
statement required by this section. 366
(C)(1) If a wholesaler acting as the grantee fails to make 367
the disclosures required by this section before entering into a 368
binding contract that transfers an interest in residential real 369
S. B. No. 155 Page 14
As Reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee
property, the record owner of the residential real property may 370
cancel the contract at any time prior to the close of escrow 371
without penalty and the escrow or closing agent, as defined in 372

Section 9:
section 1349.20 of the Revised Code, shall disburse any earnest 373
money paid by the wholesaler to the record owner within thirty 374
days after such cancelation. 375
(2) No provision of this section shall be modified or 376
waived by any oral or written agreement. Any portion of an 377
agreement that is executed, modified, or extended after the 378
effective date of this section that modifies or waives a duty 379
under division (B) of this section or a remedy under division 380
(C) of this section is void ab initio and unenforceable. 381
(3) Any violation of this section is an unfair or 382
deceptive act or practice in violation of section 1345.02 of the 383
Revised Code. A party that enters into an agreement without 384
receiving the disclosures required in this section has a cause 385
of action against a wholesaler and is entitled to the same 386
relief available to a consumer under section 1345.09 of the 387
Revised Code. All powers and remedies available to the attorney 388
general to enforce sections 1345.01 to 1345.13 of the Revised 389
Code are available to the attorney general to enforce this 390

Section 10:

(5) The earnest money becomes unclaimed funds as defined 268

169.03 of the Revised Code and has remitted all of the earnest 273

Sec. 5301.95. (A) For the purposes of this section : 300
(1) "Residential real property" means real property that 301
is improved by a building or other structure that has one to 302
four dwelling units. 303
(2)(a) "Wholesaler" means a person or entity that for a 304
fee, commission, or other valuable consideration, or with the 305
intention, in the expectation, or upon the promise of receiving 306
or collecting a fee, commission, or other valuable 307
consideration, enters into a purchase contract for residential 308
real property either: 309
(i) As the grantee, and assigns or novates that contract 310
to another person or entity; 311

S. B. No. 155 Page 12
As Reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee
(ii) As the grantor, and, without holding legal title to 312
that real property, assigns or novates that contract to another 313
person or entity. 314
(b) "Wholesaler" does not include either of the following: 315
(i) An individual who assigns or novates a contract 316
described in division (A)(2)(a) of this section to another 317
individual who is related by blood. 318
(ii) A person or entity that assigns or novates such a 319
contract to a parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or affiliated group 320
under common control with the person or entity. 321
(B)(1) Before entering into a binding contract that 322
transfers an interest in residential real property, a wholesaler 323
acting as the grantee or the wholesaler's representative, if 324
applicable, shall provide to the record owner a conspicuous 325
written disclosure statement, separate from the purchase 326
contract or agreement, printed in boldface type in a font size 327
not less than twelve points, and in substantially the following 328
form: 329
"Ohio law requires a wholesaler acting as a grantee, 330
before entering into a contract or agreement that conveys an 331
interest in residential real property, to provide certain 332
information to the record owner in a conspicuous manner printed 333
in boldface type in a font size not less than twelve points. 334
Failure by a wholesaler to present or complete this form is an 335
unfair or deceptive act or practice. Any person who enters into 336
an agreement that conveys an interest in residential real 337
property to a wholesaler acting as a grantee without receiving 338
this disclosure has a cause of action against the wholesaler. A 339
wholesaler acting as a grantee is prohibited from entering into 340

S. B. No. 155 Page 13
As Reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee
a binding contract to acquire an interest in residential real 341
property unless this statement is signed and dated by the record 342
owner of the property. 343
The owner acknowledges that the person presenting this 344
document is a wholesaler, as defined by section 5301.95 of the 345
Revised Code, and that the owner is advised to seek legal advice 346
before entering into any agreement or contract with the 347
wholesaler. A wholesaler is acting on the wholesaler's own 348
behalf and does not represent the owner in this transaction. A 349
wholesaler enters assignable contracts with owners and seeks to 350
sell or assign the wholesaler's interest for a profit. The 351
wholesaler may assign the wholesaler's interest in the purchase 352
contract to a third party without the owner's consent before 353
closing. The wholesaler may charge a fee to the third-party 354
buyer separately for profit. The agreed purchase price between 355
the owner and wholesaler may be below market value and is 356
conveyed voluntarily. 357
The owner acknowledges disclosure of the information 358
provided in this form by signing and dating below: 359
_______________ (Property owner signature) ______ (date) 360
_______________ (Wholesaler signature) _____ (date)" 361
(2) A wholesaler acting as the grantee shall not enter 362
into a binding contract that transfers an interest in 363
residential real property until both the wholesaler and the 364
record owner of the property sign and date the disclosure 365
statement required by this section. 366
(C)(1) If a wholesaler acting as the grantee fails to make 367
the disclosures required by this section before entering into a 368
binding contract that transfers an interest in residential real 369

S. B. No. 155 Page 14
As Reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee
property, the record owner of the residential real property may 370
cancel the contract at any time prior to the close of escrow 371
without penalty and the escrow or closing agent, as defined in 372
section 1349.20 of the Revised Code, shall disburse any earnest 373
money paid by the wholesaler to the record owner within thirty 374
days after such cancelation. 375
(2) No provision of this section shall be modified or 376
waived by any oral or written agreement. Any portion of an 377
agreement that is executed, modified, or extended after the 378
effective date of this section that modifies or waives a duty 379
under division (B) of this section or a remedy under division 380
(C) of this section is void ab initio and unenforceable. 381
(3) Any violation of this section is an unfair or 382
deceptive act or practice in violation of section 1345.02 of the 383
Revised Code. A party that enters into an agreement without 384
receiving the disclosures required in this section has a cause 385
of action against a wholesaler and is entitled to the same 386
relief available to a consumer under section 1345.09 of the 387
Revised Code. All powers and remedies available to the attorney 388
general to enforce sections 1345.01 to 1345.13 of the Revised 389
Code are available to the attorney general to enforce this 390
section. 391
Section 2. That existing sections 4735.18 and 4735.24 of 392
the Revised Code are hereby repealed. 393
