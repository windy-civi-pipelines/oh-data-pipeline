the individual to submit to a mental examination, physical 3537
examination, including an HIV test, or both a mental and a 3538
physical examination. The expense of the examination is the 3539
responsibility of the individual compelled to be examined. 3540
Failure to submit to a mental or physical examination or consent 3541
to an HIV test ordered by the board constitutes an admission of 3542
the allegations against the individual unless the failure is due 3543
to circumstances beyond the individual's control, and a default 3544

or presentation of evidence. If the board finds an individual 3546
unable to practice because of the reasons set forth in this 3547

doing, shall be deemed to have given consent to submit to a 3559

to seal or expunge the records. The board shall not be required 3853
to seal, expunge, destroy, redact, or otherwise modify its 3854
records to reflect the court's sealing of conviction records. 3855
(F)(1) The board shall investigate evidence that appears 3856
to show that a person has violated any provision of this chapter 3857
or any rule adopted under it. Any person may report to the board 3858
in a signed writing any information that the person may have 3859
that appears to show a violation of any provision of this 3860
chapter or any rule adopted under it. In the absence of bad 3861
faith, any person who reports information of that nature or who 3862
testifies before the board in any adjudication conducted under 3863
Chapter 119. of the Revised Code shall not be liable in damages 3864
in a civil action as a result of the report or testimony. Each 3865
complaint or allegation of a violation received by the board 3866
shall be assigned a case number and shall be recorded by the 3867
board. 3868
(2) Investigations of alleged violations of this chapter 3869
or any rule adopted under it shall be supervised by the 3870
supervising member elected by the board in accordance with 3871

Section 158:
section 4731.02 of the Revised Code and by the secretary as 3872
provided in section 4731.39 of the Revised Code. The president 3873
may designate another member of the board to supervise the 3874
investigation in place of the supervising member. Upon a vote of 3875
the majority of the board to authorize the addition of a 3876
consumer member in the supervision of any part of any 3877
H. B. No. 537 Page 136
As Introduced
investigation, the president shall designate a consumer member 3878
for supervision of investigations as determined by the 3879
president. The authorization of consumer member participation in 3880
investigation supervision may be rescinded by a majority vote of 3881
the board. No member of the board who supervises the 3882
investigation of a case shall participate in further 3883
adjudication of the case. 3884
(3) In investigating a possible violation of this chapter 3885
or any rule adopted under this chapter, or in conducting an 3886
inspection under division (E) of section 4731.054 of the Revised 3887
Code, the board may question witnesses, conduct interviews, 3888
administer oaths, order the taking of depositions, inspect and 3889
copy any books, accounts, papers, records, or documents, issue 3890
subpoenas, and compel the attendance of witnesses and production 3891
of books, accounts, papers, records, documents, and testimony, 3892
except that a subpoena for patient record information shall not 3893
be issued without consultation with the attorney general's 3894
office and approval of the secretary of the board. 3895
(a) Before issuance of a subpoena for patient record 3896
information, the secretary shall determine whether there is 3897
probable cause to believe that the complaint filed alleges a 3898
violation of this chapter or any rule adopted under it and that 3899
the records sought are relevant to the alleged violation and 3900
material to the investigation. The subpoena may apply only to 3901
records that cover a reasonable period of time surrounding the 3902
alleged violation. 3903
(b) On failure to comply with any subpoena issued by the 3904
board and after reasonable notice to the person being 3905
subpoenaed, the board may move for an order compelling the 3906
production of persons or records pursuant to the Rules of Civil 3907
H. B. No. 537 Page 137
As Introduced
Procedure. 3908
(c) A subpoena issued by the board may be served by a 3909
sheriff, the sheriff's deputy, or a board employee or agent 3910
designated by the board. Service of a subpoena issued by the 3911
board may be made by delivering a copy of the subpoena to the 3912
person named therein, reading it to the person, or leaving it at 3913
the person's usual place of residence, usual place of business, 3914
or address on file with the board. When serving a subpoena to an 3915
applicant for or the holder of a license or certificate issued 3916
under this chapter, service of the subpoena may be made by 3917
certified mail, return receipt requested, and the subpoena shall 3918
be deemed served on the date delivery is made or the date the 3919
person refuses to accept delivery. If the person being served 3920
refuses to accept the subpoena or is not located, service may be 3921
made to an attorney who notifies the board that the attorney is 3922
representing the person. 3923
(d) A sheriff's deputy who serves a subpoena shall receive 3924
the same fees as a sheriff. Each witness who appears before the 3925
board in obedience to a subpoena shall receive the fees and 3926
mileage provided for under section 119.094 of the Revised Code. 3927
(4) All hearings, investigations, and inspections of the 3928
board shall be considered civil actions for the purposes of 3929

Section 159:
section 2305.252 of the Revised Code. 3930
(5) A report required to be submitted to the board under 3931
this chapter, a complaint, or information received by the board 3932
pursuant to an investigation or pursuant to an inspection under 3933
division (E) of section 4731.054 of the Revised Code is 3934
confidential and not subject to discovery in any civil action. 3935
The board shall conduct all investigations or inspections 3936
H. B. No. 537 Page 138
As Introduced
and proceedings in a manner that protects the confidentiality of 3937
patients and persons who file complaints with the board. The 3938
board shall not make public the names or any other identifying 3939
information about patients or complainants unless proper consent 3940
is given or, in the case of a patient, a waiver of the patient 3941
privilege exists under division (B) of section 2317.02 of the 3942
Revised Code, except that consent or a waiver of that nature is 3943
not required if the board possesses reliable and substantial 3944
evidence that no bona fide physician-patient relationship 3945
exists. 3946
The board may share any information it receives pursuant 3947
to an investigation or inspection, including patient records and 3948
patient record information, with law enforcement agencies, other 3949
licensing boards, and other governmental agencies that are 3950
prosecuting, adjudicating, or investigating alleged violations 3951
of statutes or administrative rules. An agency or board that 3952
receives the information shall comply with the same requirements 3953
regarding confidentiality as those with which the state medical 3954
board must comply, notwithstanding any conflicting provision of 3955
the Revised Code or procedure of the agency or board that 3956
applies when it is dealing with other information in its 3957
possession. In a judicial proceeding, the information may be 3958
admitted into evidence only in accordance with the Rules of 3959
Evidence, but the court shall require that appropriate measures 3960
are taken to ensure that confidentiality is maintained with 3961
respect to any part of the information that contains names or 3962
other identifying information about patients or complainants 3963
whose confidentiality was protected by the state medical board 3964
when the information was in the board's possession. Measures to 3965
ensure confidentiality that may be taken by the court include 3966
sealing its records or deleting specific information from its 3967
H. B. No. 537 Page 139
As Introduced
records. 3968
No person shall knowingly access, use, or disclose 3969
confidential investigatory information in a manner prohibited by 3970
law. 3971
(6) On a quarterly basis, the board shall prepare a report 3972
that documents the disposition of all cases during the preceding 3973
three months. The report shall contain the following information 3974
for each case with which the board has completed its activities: 3975
(a) The case number assigned to the complaint or alleged 3976
violation; 3977
(b) The type of license or certificate to practice, if 3978
any, held by the individual against whom the complaint is 3979
directed; 3980
(c) A description of the allegations contained in the 3981
complaint; 3982
(d) Whether witnesses were interviewed; 3983
(e) Whether the individual against whom the complaint is 3984
directed is the subject of any pending complaints; 3985
(f) The disposition of the case. 3986
The report shall state how many cases are still pending 3987
and shall be prepared in a manner that protects the identity of 3988
each person involved in each case. The report shall be a public 3989
record under section 149.43 of the Revised Code. 3990
(7) The board may provide a status update regarding an 3991
investigation to a complainant on request if the board verifies 3992
the complainant's identity. 3993
(G)(1) If either of the following circumstances occur, the 3994
H. B. No. 537 Page 140
As Introduced
secretary and supervising member may recommend that the board 3995
suspend an individual's license or certificate to practice or 3996
certificate to recommend without a prior hearing: 3997
(a) The secretary and supervising member determine both of 3998
the following: 3999
(i) That there is clear and convincing evidence that an 4000
individual has violated division (B) of this section; 4001
(ii) That the individual's continued practice presents a 4002
danger of immediate and serious harm to the public. 4003
(b) The board receives verifiable information that a 4004
licensee has been charged in any state or federal court with a 4005
crime classified as a felony under the charging court's law and 4006
the conduct constitutes a violation of division (B) of this 4007

Section 160:
section. 4008
(2) If a recommendation is made to suspend without a prior 4009
hearing pursuant to division (G)(1) of this section, written 4010
allegations shall be prepared for consideration by the board. 4011
The board, upon review of those allegations and by an 4012
affirmative vote of not fewer than six of its members, excluding 4013
the secretary and supervising member, may suspend a license or 4014
certificate without a prior hearing. A telephone conference call 4015
may be utilized for reviewing the allegations and taking the 4016
vote on the summary suspension. 4017
The board shall serve a written order of suspension in 4018
accordance with sections 119.05 and 119.07 of the Revised Code. 4019
If the individual subject to the summary suspension requests an 4020
adjudicatory hearing by the board, the date set for the hearing 4021
shall be within fifteen days, but not earlier than seven days, 4022
after the individual requests the hearing, unless otherwise 4023
H. B. No. 537 Page 141
As Introduced
agreed to by both the board and the individual. 4024
(3) Any summary suspension imposed under division (G)(2) 4025
of this section is not a final appealable order and is not an 4026
adjudication that may be appealed under section 119.12 of the 4027
Revised Code. The summary suspension shall remain in effect 4028
until a final adjudicative order issued by the board pursuant to 4029
this section and Chapter 119. of the Revised Code becomes 4030
effective. Once a final adjudicative order has been issued by 4031
the board, any party adversely affected by it may file an appeal 4032
in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 119. of the 4033
Revised Code. 4034
The board shall issue its final adjudicative order within 4035
seventy-five days after completion of its hearing. A failure to 4036
issue the order within seventy-five days shall result in 4037
dissolution of the summary suspension order but shall not 4038
invalidate any subsequent, final adjudicative order. 4039
(H) If the board takes action under division (B)(9), (11), 4040
or (13) of this section and the judicial finding of guilt, 4041
guilty plea, or judicial finding of eligibility for intervention 4042
in lieu of conviction is overturned on appeal, upon exhaustion 4043
of the criminal appeal, a petition for reconsideration of the 4044
order may be filed with the board along with appropriate court 4045
documents. Upon receipt of a petition of that nature and 4046
supporting court documents, the board shall reinstate the 4047
individual's license or certificate to practice. The board may 4048
then hold an adjudication under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code 4049
to determine whether the individual committed the act in 4050
question. Notice of an opportunity for a hearing shall be given 4051
in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code. If the 4052
board finds, pursuant to an adjudication held under this 4053
H. B. No. 537 Page 142
As Introduced
division, that the individual committed the act or if no hearing 4054
is requested, the board may order any of the sanctions 4055
identified under division (B) of this section. 4056
(I) The license or certificate to practice issued to an 4057
individual under this chapter and the individual's practice in 4058
this state are automatically suspended as of the date of the 4059
individual's second or subsequent plea of guilty to, or judicial 4060
finding of guilt of, a violation of section 2919.123 or 2919.124 4061
of the Revised Code. In addition, the license or certificate to 4062
practice or certificate to recommend issued to an individual 4063
under this chapter and the individual's practice in this state 4064
are automatically suspended as of the date the individual pleads 4065
guilty to, is found by a judge or jury to be guilty of, or is 4066
subject to a judicial finding of eligibility for intervention in 4067
lieu of conviction in this state or treatment or intervention in 4068
lieu of conviction in another jurisdiction for any of the 4069
following criminal offenses in this state or a substantially 4070
equivalent criminal offense in another jurisdiction: aggravated 4071
murder, murder, voluntary manslaughter, felonious assault, 4072
trafficking in persons, kidnapping, rape, sexual battery, gross 4073
sexual imposition, aggravated arson, aggravated robbery, or 4074
aggravated burglary. Continued practice after suspension shall 4075
be considered practicing without a license or certificate. 4076
The board shall notify the individual subject to the 4077
suspension in accordance with sections 119.05 and 119.07 of the 4078
Revised Code. If an individual whose license or certificate is 4079
automatically suspended under this division fails to make a 4080
timely request for an adjudication under Chapter 119. of the 4081
Revised Code, the board shall do whichever of the following is 4082
applicable: 4083
H. B. No. 537 Page 143
As Introduced
(1) If the automatic suspension under this division is for 4084
a second or subsequent plea of guilty to, or judicial finding of 4085
guilt of, a violation of section 2919.123 or 2919.124 of the 4086
Revised Code, the board shall enter an order suspending the 4087
individual's license or certificate to practice for a period of 4088
at least one year or, if determined appropriate by the board, 4089
imposing a more serious sanction involving the individual's 4090
license or certificate to practice. 4091
(2) In all circumstances in which division (I)(1) of this 4092

Section 161:
section does not apply, enter a final order permanently revoking 4093
the individual's license or certificate to practice. 4094
(J) If the board is required by Chapter 119. of the 4095
Revised Code to give notice of an opportunity for a hearing and 4096
if the individual subject to the notice does not timely request 4097
a hearing in accordance with section 119.07 of the Revised Code, 4098
the board is not required to hold a hearing, but may adopt, by 4099
an affirmative vote of not fewer than six of its members, a 4100
final order that contains the board's findings. In that final 4101
order, the board may order any of the sanctions identified under 4102
division (A) or (B) of this section. 4103
(K) Any action taken by the board under division (B) of 4104
this section resulting in a suspension from practice shall be 4105
accompanied by a written statement of the conditions under which 4106
the individual's license or certificate to practice may be 4107
reinstated. The board shall adopt rules governing conditions to 4108
be imposed for reinstatement. Reinstatement of a license or 4109
certificate suspended pursuant to division (B) of this section 4110
requires an affirmative vote of not fewer than six members of 4111
the board. 4112

license or certificate to practice, refuses to renew an 4115
individual's license or certificate to practice, or refuses to 4116
reinstate an individual's license or certificate to practice, 4117
the board may specify that its action is permanent. An 4118
individual subject to a permanent action taken by the board is 4119
forever thereafter ineligible to hold a license or certificate 4120
to practice and the board shall not accept an application for 4121
reinstatement of the license or certificate or for issuance of a 4122
new license or certificate. 4123

Code, all of the following apply: 4125
(1) The surrender of a license or certificate issued under 4126
this chapter shall not be effective unless or until accepted by 4127
the board. A telephone conference call may be utilized for 4128
acceptance of the surrender of an individual's license or 4129
certificate to practice. The telephone conference call shall be 4130
considered a special meeting under division (F) of section 4131

Section 162:
121.22 of the Revised Code. Reinstatement of a license or 4132
certificate surrendered to the board requires an affirmative 4133
vote of not fewer than six members of the board. 4134
(2) An application for a license or certificate made under 4135
the provisions of this chapter may not be withdrawn without 4136
approval of the board. 4137

certificate to practice in accordance with this chapter or a 4139
certificate to recommend in accordance with rules adopted under 4140

disciplinary action against the individual with regard to the 4147
license as it existed before being placed on retired status. 4148
(5) At the request of the board, a license or certificate 4149

of this section against any person who waives deductibles and 4154
copayments as follows: 4155

expressly allows such a practice. Waiver of the deductibles or 4157
copayments shall be made only with the full knowledge and 4158
consent of the plan purchaser, payer, and third-party 4159
administrator. Documentation of the consent shall be made 4160
available to the board upon request. 4161

authorized to practice pursuant to this chapter, to the extent 4163
allowed by this chapter and rules adopted by the board. 4164
(O) Under the board's investigative duties described in 4165
this section and subject to division (F) of this section, the 4166
board shall develop and implement a quality intervention program 4167
designed to improve through remedial education the clinical and 4168
communication skills of individuals authorized under this 4169

(Q) A license or certificate to practice or certificate to 4201
recommend issued to an individual under this chapter and an 4202
individual's practice under this chapter in this state are 4203
automatically suspended if the individual's license or 4204

relinquished in lieu of discipline by an agency responsible for 4207
authorizing, certifying, or regulating an individual to practice 4208
a health care occupation or provide health care services in this 4209
state or another jurisdiction. The automatic suspension begins 4210
immediately upon entry of the order by the agency and lasts for 4211
ninety days to permit the board to investigate the basis for the 4212
action under this chapter. Continued practice during the 4213
automatic suspension shall be considered practicing without a 4214
license or certificate. 4215
The board shall notify the individual subject to the 4216
automatic suspension by certified mail or in person in 4217

arrangement by the state medical board is not required, but the 4242
board may periodically review it. 4243
A physician or podiatrist who terminates collaboration 4244
with a certified midwife, certified nurse-midwife, certified 4245

the employee's collaborating physician is subject to approval by 4257
the medical staff and governing body of the hospital prior to 4258
implementation of the arrangement at the hospital. 4259

remediation, and if the individual enters into an agreement with 1339
the board to seek remediation as prescribed by the board, 1340
complies with the terms and conditions of the remediation, and 1341

(C) Disciplinary actions taken by the board under 3802
divisions (A) and (B) of this section shall be taken pursuant to 3803
an adjudication under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code, except 3804
that in lieu of an adjudication, the board may enter into a 3805
consent agreement with an individual to resolve an allegation of 3806
a violation of this chapter or any rule adopted under it. A 3807
consent agreement, when ratified by an affirmative vote of not 3808
fewer than six members of the board, shall constitute the 3809
findings and order of the board with respect to the matter 3810
addressed in the agreement. If the board refuses to ratify a 3811
consent agreement, the admissions and findings contained in the 3812
consent agreement shall be of no force or effect. 3813

a special meeting under division (F) of section 121.22 of the 3818
Revised Code. 3819
If the board takes disciplinary action against an 3820
individual under division (B) of this section for a second or 3821
subsequent plea of guilty to, or judicial finding of guilt of, a 3822
violation of section 2919.123 or 2919.124 of the Revised Code, 3823
the disciplinary action shall consist of a suspension of the 3824
individual's license or certificate to practice for a period of 3825
at least one year or, if determined appropriate by the board, a 3826
more serious sanction involving the individual's license or 3827
certificate to practice. Any consent agreement entered into 3828
under this division with an individual that pertains to a second 3829
or subsequent plea of guilty to, or judicial finding of guilt 3830
of, a violation of that section shall provide for a suspension 3831
of the individual's license or certificate to practice for a 3832
period of at least one year or, if determined appropriate by the 3833
board, a more serious sanction involving the individual's 3834
license or certificate to practice. 3835
(D) For purposes of divisions (B)(10), (12), and (14) of 3836
this section, the commission of the act may be established by a 3837
finding by the board, pursuant to an adjudication under Chapter 3838
119. of the Revised Code, that the individual committed the act. 3839
The board does not have jurisdiction under those divisions if 3840
the trial court renders a final judgment in the individual's 3841
favor and that judgment is based upon an adjudication on the 3842
merits. The board has jurisdiction under those divisions if the 3843
trial court issues an order of dismissal upon technical or 3844
procedural grounds. 3845
(E) The sealing or expungement of conviction records by 3846

H. B. No. 537 Page 135
As Introduced
any court shall have no effect upon a prior board order entered 3847
under this section or upon the board's jurisdiction to take 3848
action under this section if, based upon a plea of guilty, a 3849
judicial finding of guilt, or a judicial finding of eligibility 3850
for intervention in lieu of conviction, the board issued a 3851
notice of opportunity for a hearing prior to the court's order 3852
to seal or expunge the records. The board shall not be required 3853
to seal, expunge, destroy, redact, or otherwise modify its 3854
records to reflect the court's sealing of conviction records. 3855
(F)(1) The board shall investigate evidence that appears 3856
to show that a person has violated any provision of this chapter 3857
or any rule adopted under it. Any person may report to the board 3858
in a signed writing any information that the person may have 3859
that appears to show a violation of any provision of this 3860
chapter or any rule adopted under it. In the absence of bad 3861
faith, any person who reports information of that nature or who 3862
testifies before the board in any adjudication conducted under 3863
Chapter 119. of the Revised Code shall not be liable in damages 3864
in a civil action as a result of the report or testimony. Each 3865
complaint or allegation of a violation received by the board 3866
shall be assigned a case number and shall be recorded by the 3867
board. 3868
(2) Investigations of alleged violations of this chapter 3869
or any rule adopted under it shall be supervised by the 3870
supervising member elected by the board in accordance with 3871
section 4731.02 of the Revised Code and by the secretary as 3872
provided in section 4731.39 of the Revised Code. The president 3873
may designate another member of the board to supervise the 3874
investigation in place of the supervising member. Upon a vote of 3875
the majority of the board to authorize the addition of a 3876
consumer member in the supervision of any part of any 3877

H. B. No. 537 Page 136

investigation, the president shall designate a consumer member 3878
for supervision of investigations as determined by the 3879
president. The authorization of consumer member participation in 3880
investigation supervision may be rescinded by a majority vote of 3881
the board. No member of the board who supervises the 3882
investigation of a case shall participate in further 3883
adjudication of the case. 3884
(3) In investigating a possible violation of this chapter 3885
or any rule adopted under this chapter, or in conducting an 3886
inspection under division (E) of section 4731.054 of the Revised 3887
Code, the board may question witnesses, conduct interviews, 3888
administer oaths, order the taking of depositions, inspect and 3889
copy any books, accounts, papers, records, or documents, issue 3890
subpoenas, and compel the attendance of witnesses and production 3891
of books, accounts, papers, records, documents, and testimony, 3892
except that a subpoena for patient record information shall not 3893
be issued without consultation with the attorney general's 3894
office and approval of the secretary of the board. 3895
(a) Before issuance of a subpoena for patient record 3896
information, the secretary shall determine whether there is 3897
probable cause to believe that the complaint filed alleges a 3898
violation of this chapter or any rule adopted under it and that 3899
the records sought are relevant to the alleged violation and 3900
material to the investigation. The subpoena may apply only to 3901
records that cover a reasonable period of time surrounding the 3902
alleged violation. 3903
(b) On failure to comply with any subpoena issued by the 3904
board and after reasonable notice to the person being 3905
subpoenaed, the board may move for an order compelling the 3906
production of persons or records pursuant to the Rules of Civil 3907

H. B. No. 537 Page 137
As Introduced
Procedure. 3908
(c) A subpoena issued by the board may be served by a 3909
sheriff, the sheriff's deputy, or a board employee or agent 3910
designated by the board. Service of a subpoena issued by the 3911
board may be made by delivering a copy of the subpoena to the 3912
person named therein, reading it to the person, or leaving it at 3913
the person's usual place of residence, usual place of business, 3914
or address on file with the board. When serving a subpoena to an 3915
applicant for or the holder of a license or certificate issued 3916
under this chapter, service of the subpoena may be made by 3917
certified mail, return receipt requested, and the subpoena shall 3918
be deemed served on the date delivery is made or the date the 3919
person refuses to accept delivery. If the person being served 3920
refuses to accept the subpoena or is not located, service may be 3921
made to an attorney who notifies the board that the attorney is 3922
representing the person. 3923
(d) A sheriff's deputy who serves a subpoena shall receive 3924
the same fees as a sheriff. Each witness who appears before the 3925
board in obedience to a subpoena shall receive the fees and 3926
mileage provided for under section 119.094 of the Revised Code. 3927
(4) All hearings, investigations, and inspections of the 3928
board shall be considered civil actions for the purposes of 3929
section 2305.252 of the Revised Code. 3930
(5) A report required to be submitted to the board under 3931
this chapter, a complaint, or information received by the board 3932
pursuant to an investigation or pursuant to an inspection under 3933
division (E) of section 4731.054 of the Revised Code is 3934
confidential and not subject to discovery in any civil action. 3935
The board shall conduct all investigations or inspections 3936

H. B. No. 537 Page 138
As Introduced
and proceedings in a manner that protects the confidentiality of 3937
patients and persons who file complaints with the board. The 3938
board shall not make public the names or any other identifying 3939
information about patients or complainants unless proper consent 3940
is given or, in the case of a patient, a waiver of the patient 3941
privilege exists under division (B) of section 2317.02 of the 3942
Revised Code, except that consent or a waiver of that nature is 3943
not required if the board possesses reliable and substantial 3944
evidence that no bona fide physician-patient relationship 3945
exists. 3946
The board may share any information it receives pursuant 3947
to an investigation or inspection, including patient records and 3948
patient record information, with law enforcement agencies, other 3949
licensing boards, and other governmental agencies that are 3950
prosecuting, adjudicating, or investigating alleged violations 3951
of statutes or administrative rules. An agency or board that 3952
receives the information shall comply with the same requirements 3953
regarding confidentiality as those with which the state medical 3954
board must comply, notwithstanding any conflicting provision of 3955
the Revised Code or procedure of the agency or board that 3956
applies when it is dealing with other information in its 3957
possession. In a judicial proceeding, the information may be 3958
admitted into evidence only in accordance with the Rules of 3959
Evidence, but the court shall require that appropriate measures 3960
are taken to ensure that confidentiality is maintained with 3961
respect to any part of the information that contains names or 3962
other identifying information about patients or complainants 3963
whose confidentiality was protected by the state medical board 3964
when the information was in the board's possession. Measures to 3965
ensure confidentiality that may be taken by the court include 3966
sealing its records or deleting specific information from its 3967

H. B. No. 537 Page 139
As Introduced
records. 3968
No person shall knowingly access, use, or disclose 3969
confidential investigatory information in a manner prohibited by 3970
law. 3971
(6) On a quarterly basis, the board shall prepare a report 3972
that documents the disposition of all cases during the preceding 3973
three months. The report shall contain the following information 3974
for each case with which the board has completed its activities: 3975
(a) The case number assigned to the complaint or alleged 3976
violation; 3977
(b) The type of license or certificate to practice, if 3978
any, held by the individual against whom the complaint is 3979
directed; 3980
(c) A description of the allegations contained in the 3981
complaint; 3982
(d) Whether witnesses were interviewed; 3983
(e) Whether the individual against whom the complaint is 3984
directed is the subject of any pending complaints; 3985
(f) The disposition of the case. 3986
The report shall state how many cases are still pending 3987
and shall be prepared in a manner that protects the identity of 3988
each person involved in each case. The report shall be a public 3989
record under section 149.43 of the Revised Code. 3990
(7) The board may provide a status update regarding an 3991
investigation to a complainant on request if the board verifies 3992
the complainant's identity. 3993
(G)(1) If either of the following circumstances occur, the 3994

H. B. No. 537 Page 140
As Introduced
secretary and supervising member may recommend that the board 3995
suspend an individual's license or certificate to practice or 3996
certificate to recommend without a prior hearing: 3997
(a) The secretary and supervising member determine both of 3998
the following: 3999
(i) That there is clear and convincing evidence that an 4000
individual has violated division (B) of this section; 4001
(ii) That the individual's continued practice presents a 4002
danger of immediate and serious harm to the public. 4003
(b) The board receives verifiable information that a 4004
licensee has been charged in any state or federal court with a 4005
crime classified as a felony under the charging court's law and 4006
the conduct constitutes a violation of division (B) of this 4007
section. 4008
(2) If a recommendation is made to suspend without a prior 4009
hearing pursuant to division (G)(1) of this section, written 4010
allegations shall be prepared for consideration by the board. 4011
The board, upon review of those allegations and by an 4012
affirmative vote of not fewer than six of its members, excluding 4013
the secretary and supervising member, may suspend a license or 4014
certificate without a prior hearing. A telephone conference call 4015
may be utilized for reviewing the allegations and taking the 4016
vote on the summary suspension. 4017
The board shall serve a written order of suspension in 4018
accordance with sections 119.05 and 119.07 of the Revised Code. 4019
If the individual subject to the summary suspension requests an 4020
adjudicatory hearing by the board, the date set for the hearing 4021
shall be within fifteen days, but not earlier than seven days, 4022
after the individual requests the hearing, unless otherwise 4023

H. B. No. 537 Page 141
As Introduced
agreed to by both the board and the individual. 4024
(3) Any summary suspension imposed under division (G)(2) 4025
of this section is not a final appealable order and is not an 4026
adjudication that may be appealed under section 119.12 of the 4027
Revised Code. The summary suspension shall remain in effect 4028
until a final adjudicative order issued by the board pursuant to 4029
this section and Chapter 119. of the Revised Code becomes 4030
effective. Once a final adjudicative order has been issued by 4031
the board, any party adversely affected by it may file an appeal 4032
in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 119. of the 4033
Revised Code. 4034
The board shall issue its final adjudicative order within 4035
seventy-five days after completion of its hearing. A failure to 4036
issue the order within seventy-five days shall result in 4037
dissolution of the summary suspension order but shall not 4038
invalidate any subsequent, final adjudicative order. 4039
(H) If the board takes action under division (B)(9), (11), 4040
or (13) of this section and the judicial finding of guilt, 4041
guilty plea, or judicial finding of eligibility for intervention 4042
in lieu of conviction is overturned on appeal, upon exhaustion 4043
of the criminal appeal, a petition for reconsideration of the 4044
order may be filed with the board along with appropriate court 4045
documents. Upon receipt of a petition of that nature and 4046
supporting court documents, the board shall reinstate the 4047
individual's license or certificate to practice. The board may 4048
then hold an adjudication under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code 4049
to determine whether the individual committed the act in 4050
question. Notice of an opportunity for a hearing shall be given 4051
in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code. If the 4052
board finds, pursuant to an adjudication held under this 4053

H. B. No. 537 Page 142
As Introduced
division, that the individual committed the act or if no hearing 4054
is requested, the board may order any of the sanctions 4055
identified under division (B) of this section. 4056
(I) The license or certificate to practice issued to an 4057
individual under this chapter and the individual's practice in 4058
this state are automatically suspended as of the date of the 4059
individual's second or subsequent plea of guilty to, or judicial 4060
finding of guilt of, a violation of section 2919.123 or 2919.124 4061
of the Revised Code. In addition, the license or certificate to 4062
practice or certificate to recommend issued to an individual 4063
under this chapter and the individual's practice in this state 4064
are automatically suspended as of the date the individual pleads 4065
guilty to, is found by a judge or jury to be guilty of, or is 4066
subject to a judicial finding of eligibility for intervention in 4067
lieu of conviction in this state or treatment or intervention in 4068
lieu of conviction in another jurisdiction for any of the 4069
following criminal offenses in this state or a substantially 4070
equivalent criminal offense in another jurisdiction: aggravated 4071
murder, murder, voluntary manslaughter, felonious assault, 4072
trafficking in persons, kidnapping, rape, sexual battery, gross 4073
sexual imposition, aggravated arson, aggravated robbery, or 4074
aggravated burglary. Continued practice after suspension shall 4075
be considered practicing without a license or certificate. 4076
The board shall notify the individual subject to the 4077
suspension in accordance with sections 119.05 and 119.07 of the 4078
Revised Code. If an individual whose license or certificate is 4079
automatically suspended under this division fails to make a 4080
timely request for an adjudication under Chapter 119. of the 4081
Revised Code, the board shall do whichever of the following is 4082
applicable: 4083

H. B. No. 537 Page 143
As Introduced
(1) If the automatic suspension under this division is for 4084
a second or subsequent plea of guilty to, or judicial finding of 4085
guilt of, a violation of section 2919.123 or 2919.124 of the 4086
Revised Code, the board shall enter an order suspending the 4087
individual's license or certificate to practice for a period of 4088
at least one year or, if determined appropriate by the board, 4089
imposing a more serious sanction involving the individual's 4090
license or certificate to practice. 4091
(2) In all circumstances in which division (I)(1) of this 4092
section does not apply, enter a final order permanently revoking 4093
the individual's license or certificate to practice. 4094
(J) If the board is required by Chapter 119. of the 4095
Revised Code to give notice of an opportunity for a hearing and 4096
if the individual subject to the notice does not timely request 4097
a hearing in accordance with section 119.07 of the Revised Code, 4098
the board is not required to hold a hearing, but may adopt, by 4099
an affirmative vote of not fewer than six of its members, a 4100
final order that contains the board's findings. In that final 4101
order, the board may order any of the sanctions identified under 4102
division (A) or (B) of this section. 4103
(K) Any action taken by the board under division (B) of 4104
this section resulting in a suspension from practice shall be 4105
accompanied by a written statement of the conditions under which 4106
the individual's license or certificate to practice may be 4107
reinstated. The board shall adopt rules governing conditions to 4108
be imposed for reinstatement. Reinstatement of a license or 4109
certificate suspended pursuant to division (B) of this section 4110
requires an affirmative vote of not fewer than six members of 4111
the board. 4112

license or certificate to practice, refuses to renew an 4115
individual's license or certificate to practice, or refuses to 4116
reinstate an individual's license or certificate to practice, 4117
the board may specify that its action is permanent. An 4118
individual subject to a permanent action taken by the board is 4119
forever thereafter ineligible to hold a license or certificate 4120
to practice and the board shall not accept an application for 4121
reinstatement of the license or certificate or for issuance of a 4122
new license or certificate. 4123
(M) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Revised 4124
Code, all of the following apply: 4125
(1) The surrender of a license or certificate issued under 4126
this chapter shall not be effective unless or until accepted by 4127
the board. A telephone conference call may be utilized for 4128
acceptance of the surrender of an individual's license or 4129
certificate to practice. The telephone conference call shall be 4130
considered a special meeting under division (F) of section 4131
121.22 of the Revised Code. Reinstatement of a license or 4132
certificate surrendered to the board requires an affirmative 4133
vote of not fewer than six members of the board. 4134
(2) An application for a license or certificate made under 4135
the provisions of this chapter may not be withdrawn without 4136
approval of the board. 4137
(3) Failure by an individual to renew a license or 4138
certificate to practice in accordance with this chapter or a 4139
certificate to recommend in accordance with rules adopted under 4140
section 4731.301 of the Revised Code does not remove or limit 4141
the board's jurisdiction to take any disciplinary action under 4142
this section against the individual. 4143

As Introduced
(4) The placement of an individual's license on retired 4144
status, as described in section 4731.283 of the Revised Code, 4145
does not remove or limit the board's jurisdiction to take any 4146
disciplinary action against the individual with regard to the 4147
license as it existed before being placed on retired status. 4148
(5) At the request of the board, a license or certificate 4149
holder shall immediately surrender to the board a license or 4150
certificate that the board has suspended, revoked, or 4151
permanently revoked. 4152
(N) Sanctions shall not be imposed under division (B)(28) 4153
of this section against any person who waives deductibles and 4154
copayments as follows: 4155
(1) In compliance with the health benefit plan that 4156
expressly allows such a practice. Waiver of the deductibles or 4157
copayments shall be made only with the full knowledge and 4158
consent of the plan purchaser, payer, and third-party 4159
administrator. Documentation of the consent shall be made 4160
available to the board upon request. 4161
(2) For professional services rendered to any other person 4162
authorized to practice pursuant to this chapter, to the extent 4163
allowed by this chapter and rules adopted by the board. 4164
(O) Under the board's investigative duties described in 4165
this section and subject to division (F) of this section, the 4166
board shall develop and implement a quality intervention program 4167
designed to improve through remedial education the clinical and 4168
communication skills of individuals authorized under this 4169

(2) Select providers of educational and assessment 4177
services, including a quality intervention program panel of case 4178
reviewers; 4179
(3) Make referrals to educational and assessment service 4180
providers and approve individual educational programs 4181
recommended by those providers. The board shall monitor the 4182

educational program. 4184
(4) Determine what constitutes successful completion of an 4185
individual educational program and require further monitoring of 4186
the individual who completed the program or other action that 4187
the board determines to be appropriate; 4188
(5) Adopt rules in accordance with Chapter 119. of the 4189
Revised Code to further implement the quality intervention 4190
program. 4191

educational program pursuant to this division shall pay the 4193
financial obligations arising from that educational program. 4194
(P) The board shall not refuse to issue a license to an 4195
applicant because of a conviction, plea of guilty, judicial 4196
finding of guilt, judicial finding of eligibility for 4197
intervention in lieu of conviction, or the commission of an act 4198
that constitutes a criminal offense, unless the refusal is in 4199

(Q) A license or certificate to practice or certificate to 4201
recommend issued to an individual under this chapter and an 4202
individual's practice under this chapter in this state are 4203
automatically suspended if the individual's license or 4204
certificate to practice a health care occupation or provide 4205
health care services is suspended, revoked, or surrendered or 4206
relinquished in lieu of discipline by an agency responsible for 4207
authorizing, certifying, or regulating an individual to practice 4208
a health care occupation or provide health care services in this 4209
state or another jurisdiction. The automatic suspension begins 4210
immediately upon entry of the order by the agency and lasts for 4211
ninety days to permit the board to investigate the basis for the 4212
action under this chapter. Continued practice during the 4213
automatic suspension shall be considered practicing without a 4214
license or certificate. 4215
The board shall notify the individual subject to the 4216
automatic suspension by certified mail or in person in 4217
accordance with section 119.07 of the Revised Code. If an 4218
individual subject to an automatic suspension under this 4219
division fails to make a timely request for an adjudication 4220

As Introduced
(B) A physician or podiatrist shall enter into a standard 4231
care arrangement with each certified midwife, clinical nurse 4232
specialist, certified nurse-midwife, or certified nurse 4233
practitioner with whom the physician or podiatrist is in 4234
collaboration. 4235
The collaborating physician or podiatrist shall fulfill 4236
the responsibilities of collaboration, as specified in the 4237
arrangement and in accordance with division (A) of section 4238
4723.431 of the Revised Code. A copy of the standard care 4239
arrangement shall be retained on file by the certified midwife's 4240
or nurse's employer. Prior approval of the standard care 4241
arrangement by the state medical board is not required, but the 4242
board may periodically review it. 4243
A physician or podiatrist who terminates collaboration 4244
with a certified midwife, certified nurse-midwife, certified 4245
nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist before their 4246
standard care arrangement expires shall give the certified 4247
midwife or nurse the written or electronic notice of termination 4248
required by division (D)(1) of section 4723.431 of the Revised 4249
Code. 4250

a certified midwife, clinical nurse specialist, certified nurse- 4252
midwife, or certified nurse practitioner as an employee and 4253
negotiating standard care arrangements on behalf of the employee 4254
as necessary to meet the requirements of this section. A 4255
standard care arrangement between the hospital's employee and 4256
the employee's collaborating physician is subject to approval by 4257
the medical staff and governing body of the hospital prior to 4258
implementation of the arrangement at the hospital. 4259
