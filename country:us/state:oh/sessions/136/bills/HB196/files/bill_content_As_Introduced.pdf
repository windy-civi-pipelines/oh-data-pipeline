state or a board of elections shall not accept for filing a 138

petition, the board of elections finds the number of signatures 176
accepted exceeds three times the minimum number of signatures 177
required. A board of elections may discontinue verifying 178
signatures on petitions when the number of verified signatures 179

If the declaration of candidacy declares a candidacy for 181
party nomination or for election as a candidate of a minor 182
party, the minimum number of signatures on such petition is one- 183
half the minimum number provided in this section, except that, 184
when the candidacy is one for election as a member of the state 185
central committee or the county central committee of a political 186
party, the minimum number shall be the same for a minor party as 187
for a major party. 188
If a declaration of candidacy is one for election as a 189
member of the state central committee or the county central 190
committee of a political party, the petition shall be signed by 191
five qualified electors of the district, county, ward, township, 192
or precinct within which electors may vote for such candidate. 193
The electors signing such petition shall be members of the same 194
political party as the political party of which the candidate is 195
a member. 196
For purposes of signing or circulating a petition of 197
candidacy for party nomination or election, an elector is 198
considered to be a member of a political party if the elector 199
voted in that party's primary election within the preceding two 200

party's primary election within the preceding two calendar 202
years. 203

Sec. 3513.261. A nominating petition may consist of one or 469
more separate petition papers, each of which shall be 470

petition consists of more than one separate petition paper, the 472

it. Each nominating petition containing signatures of electors 478
of more than one county shall consist of separate petition 479
papers each of which shall contain signatures of electors of 480
only one county; provided that petitions containing signatures 481
of electors of more than one county shall not thereby be 482
declared invalid. In case petitions containing signatures of 483
electors of more than one county are filed, the board of 484
elections shall determine the county from which the majority of 485
the signatures came, and only signatures from this county shall 486
be counted. Signatures from any other county shall be invalid. 487
All signatures on nominating petitions shall be written in 488

Revised Code. The fees shall be disposed of by those election 495
officials in the manner that is provided in section 3513.10 of 496
the Revised Code for the disposition of other fees, and in no 497
case shall a fee required under that section be returned to a 498
candidate. 499

condition precedent to the granting of their certificates of 504
election. 505
Each nominating petition shall contain a statement of 506
candidacy that shall be signed by the candidate or joint 507
candidates named in it or by an attorney in fact acting pursuant 508
to section 3501.382 of the Revised Code. Such statement of 509
