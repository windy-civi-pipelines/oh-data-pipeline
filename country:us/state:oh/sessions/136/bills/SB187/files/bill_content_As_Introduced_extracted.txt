project is certified under division (B) of this section as a tax 163
credit-eligible production or tax credit-eligible project, after 164

(1) The amount of the credit equals twenty-five per cent 197
of eligible expenditures in excess of ten thousand dollars, 198
multiplied by the investor's proportionate or distributive share 199
of the sound production company if that company is a pass- 200
through entity. 201
(2) The amount of credit awarded to all investors for a 202
production or project shall not exceed seventy-five thousand 203
dollars. If the amount of the credit, as calculated under 204
division (C)(1) of this section, would exceed seventy-five 205
thousand dollars, the director shall reduce the amount of credit 206
awarded to each investor proportionately so that the total 207
amount so awarded to all such investors equals seventy-five 208
thousand dollars. 209
(3) No credit shall be awarded on the basis of any portion 210
of an eligible expenditure that is also an eligible production 211
expenditure that forms the basis of a credit awarded under 212

(1) The amount of the credit equals twenty-five per cent 197
of eligible expenditures in excess of ten thousand dollars, 198
multiplied by the investor's proportionate or distributive share 199
of the sound production company if that company is a pass- 200
through entity. 201
(2) The amount of credit awarded to all investors for a 202
production or project shall not exceed seventy-five thousand 203
dollars. If the amount of the credit, as calculated under 204
division (C)(1) of this section, would exceed seventy-five 205
thousand dollars, the director shall reduce the amount of credit 206
awarded to each investor proportionately so that the total 207
amount so awarded to all such investors equals seventy-five 208
thousand dollars. 209
(3) No credit shall be awarded on the basis of any portion 210
of an eligible expenditure that is also an eligible production 211
expenditure that forms the basis of a credit awarded under 212
