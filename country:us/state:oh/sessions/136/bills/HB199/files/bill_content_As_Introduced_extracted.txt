registrar shall arrange for a service that enables all 2782
electronic motor vehicle dealers to file applications for 2783
certificates of title on behalf of purchasers of motor vehicles 2784

accompanying it or the electronic record to which a dealer 2790

records of motor vehicles in the clerk's office. If the clerk is 2792
satisfied that the applicant is the owner of the motor vehicle 2793
and that the application is in the proper form, the clerk, 2794
within five business days after the application is filed and 2795
except as provided in section 4505.021 of the Revised Code, 2796
shall issue a physical certificate of title over the clerk's 2797
signature and sealed with the clerk's seal, unless the applicant 2798

certificate of title and instead to issue an electronic 2800
certificate of title. For purposes of the transfer of a 2801
certificate of title, if the clerk is satisfied that the secured 2802
party has duly discharged a lien notation but has not canceled 2803
the lien notation with a clerk, the clerk may cancel the lien 2804
notation on the automated title processing system and notify the 2805
clerk of the county of origin. 2806

business days after the application for title is filed with the 2820
clerk. If the buyer of the motor vehicle previously leased the 2821
motor vehicle and is buying the motor vehicle at the end of the 2822
lease pursuant to that lease, the certificate of title shall be 2823
obtained in the name of the buyer by the motor vehicle leasing 2824
dealer who previously leased the motor vehicle to the buyer or 2825
by the motor vehicle leasing dealer who subleased the motor 2826

reimbursing the state for the expense of administering this 7439
chapter, an excise tax is hereby levied on each retail sale made 7440
in this state. 7441
(A)(1) The tax shall be collected as provided in section 7442

Section 236:
5739.025 of the Revised Code. The rate of the tax shall be five 7443
and three-fourths per cent. The tax applies and is collectible 7444

of more than thirty days or an indefinite term with a minimum 7448

shall be collected by the vendor at the time the lease or rental 7455
is consummated and shall be calculated by the vendor on the 7456
basis of the total amount to be paid by the lessee or renter 7457
under the lease agreement. If the total amount of the 7458
consideration for the lease or rental includes amounts that are 7459
not calculated at the time the lease or rental is executed, the 7460
tax shall be calculated and collected by the vendor at the time 7461

initial fixed term of the lease or rental, and for each 7465
subsequent renewal period as it comes due. As used in this 7466

A lease with a renewal clause and a termination penalty or 7470
similar provision that applies if the renewal clause is not 7471
exercised is presumed to be a sham transaction. In such a case, 7472
the tax shall be calculated and paid on the basis of the entire 7473
length of the lease period, including any renewal periods, until 7474
the termination penalty or similar provision no longer applies. 7475
The taxpayer shall bear the burden, by a preponderance of the 7476
evidence, that the transaction or series of transactions is not 7477
a sham transaction. 7478
(3) Except as provided in division (A)(2) of this section, 7479
in the case of a sale, the price of which consists in whole or 7480
in part of the lease or rental of tangible personal property, 7481
the tax shall be measured by the installments of that lease or 7482
rental. 7483

disclaimer on behalf of the ward, estate, or deceased person. 8345
The court shall order the guardian or personal representative to 8346

disclaimer instrument shall be delivered personally or by 8397
certified mail to the trustee or other person who has legal 8398
title to, or possession of, the property disclaimed. If the 8399
interest disclaimed is created by a transfer on death 8400
designation affidavit pursuant to section 5302.22 of the Revised 8401
Code, the disclaimer instrument shall be filed with the county 8402
recorder of the county in which the real property that is the 8403

The disclaimer instrument shall be filed and indexed, and fees 8424
charged, in the same manner as provided by law for an 8425
application to be appointed as personal representative to 8426
administer the decedent's estate. The disclaimer is effective 8427
whether or not proceedings thereafter are commenced to 8428
administer the decedent's estate. If proceedings thereafter are 8429
commenced for the administration of the decedent's estate, they 8430
shall be filed under, or consolidated with, the case number 8431

entered as a memorial on the last certificate of title. A spouse 8442
of a disclaimant has no dower or other interest in the real 8443
estate disclaimed. 8444

distribution of property, part of property, or interest in 8446
property if there is a disclaimer, the property, part of 8447
property, or interest disclaimed shall be distributed or 8448
disposed of, and accelerated or not accelerated, in accordance 8449

disclaimed, shall descend, be distributed, or otherwise be 8455
disposed of, and shall be accelerated, in the following manner: 8456
(1) If intestate or testate succession is disclaimed, as 8457
if the disclaimant had predeceased the decedent; 8458
(2) If the disclaimant is one designated to take pursuant 8459
to a power of appointment exercised by a testamentary 8460
instrument, as if the disclaimant had predeceased the donee of 8461
the power; 8462
(3) If the donative instrument is a nontestamentary 8463
instrument, as if the disclaimant had died before the effective 8464
date of the nontestamentary instrument; 8465
(4) If the disclaimer is of a fiduciary right, power, 8466
privilege, or immunity, as if the right, power, privilege, or 8467
immunity was never in the donative instrument. 8468
(H) A disclaimer pursuant to this section is effective as 8469
of, and relates back for all purposes to, the date upon which 8470
the taker and the taker's interest have been finally 8471
ascertained. 8472
(I) A disclaimant who has a present and future interest in 8473
property, and disclaims the disclaimant's present interest in 8474
whole or in part, is considered to have disclaimed the 8475
disclaimant's future interest to the same extent, unless a 8476
contrary intention appears in the disclaimer instrument or the 8477
donative instrument. A disclaimant is not precluded from 8478
receiving, as an alternative taker, a beneficial interest in the 8479

property or any interest in it; 8486

and executes and delivers, files, or records the waiver in the 8488
manner provided in this section for a disclaimer instrument; 8489
(3) Accepts the property or an interest in it; 8490
(4) Permits or suffers a sale or other disposition of the 8491
property pursuant to judicial action against the disclaimant. 8492
(K) Neither a fiduciary's application for appointment or 8493
assumption of duties as a fiduciary nor a beneficiary's 8494
application for appointment as a personal representative or 8495
fiduciary waives or bars the disclaimant's right to disclaim a 8496
right, power, privilege, or immunity as a personal 8497
representative or fiduciary or the beneficiary's right to 8498
disclaim property. 8499
(L) The right to disclaim under this section exists 8500
irrespective of any limitation on the interest of the 8501
disclaimant in the nature of a spendthrift provision or similar 8502
restriction. 8503
(M) A disclaimer instrument or written waiver of the right 8504
to disclaim that has been executed and delivered, filed, or 8505
recorded as required by this section is final and binding upon 8506
all persons. 8507

Code or at common law to assign, convey, release, refuse to 8512
accept, renounce, waive, or disclaim property. 8513

conveyance by the disclaimant, and no creditor of a disclaimant 8515
may avoid a disclaimer. 8516
(3) This section shall take precedence over any other 8517

Section 260:
section of the Revised Code that conflicts with this section. 8518

of property in a manner inconsistent with the terms of a valid 8520
disclaimer if the distribution or disposition is otherwise 8521
proper and the person has no actual knowledge of the disclaimer. 8522
(2) No person is liable for distributing or disposing of 8523
property in reliance upon the terms of a disclaimer that is 8524
invalid because the right of disclaimer has been waived or 8525
barred if the distribution or disposition is otherwise proper 8526
and the person has no actual knowledge of the facts that 8527
constitute a waiver or bar to the right to disclaim. 8528
(P)(1) A disclaimant may disclaim pursuant to this section 8529
any interest in property that is in existence on September 27, 8530
1976, if either the interest in the property or the taker of the 8531
interest in the property is not finally ascertained on that 8532
date. 8533

certificate of title duly assigned, unless otherwise provided in 2744
this chapter. If a certificate of title previously has not been 2745

requests a designation of the motor vehicle in beneficiary form 2758
so that upon the death of the owner of the motor vehicle, 2759

transfer-on-death beneficiary or beneficiaries, the applicant 2761
may do so as provided in section 2131.13 of the Revised Code. A 2762
person who establishes ownership of a motor vehicle that is 2763
transferable on death in accordance with section 2131.13 of the 2764
Revised Code may terminate that type of ownership or change the 2765

dealer on behalf of the purchaser of a motor vehicle, the clerk 2772
shall retain the completed electronic record to which the dealer 2773
converted the certificate of title application and other 2774
required documents. The registrar, after consultation with the 2775
attorney general, shall adopt rules that govern the location at 2776
which, and the manner in which, are stored the actual 2777
application and all other documents relating to the transfer of 2778
a motor vehicle when an electronic motor vehicle dealer files 2779
the application for a certificate of title electronically on 2780
behalf of the purchaser. Not later than December 31, 2017, the 2781
registrar shall arrange for a service that enables all 2782
electronic motor vehicle dealers to file applications for 2783
certificates of title on behalf of purchasers of motor vehicles 2784
electronically by transferring the applications directly from 2785
the computer systems of the dealers to the clerk. 2786

accompanying it or the electronic record to which a dealer 2790
converted the application and accompanying documents with the 2791
records of motor vehicles in the clerk's office. If the clerk is 2792
satisfied that the applicant is the owner of the motor vehicle 2793
and that the application is in the proper form, the clerk, 2794
within five business days after the application is filed and 2795
except as provided in section 4505.021 of the Revised Code, 2796
shall issue a physical certificate of title over the clerk's 2797
signature and sealed with the clerk's seal, unless the applicant 2798
specifically requests the clerk not to issue a physical 2799
certificate of title and instead to issue an electronic 2800
certificate of title. For purposes of the transfer of a 2801
certificate of title, if the clerk is satisfied that the secured 2802
party has duly discharged a lien notation but has not canceled 2803
the lien notation with a clerk, the clerk may cancel the lien 2804
notation on the automated title processing system and notify the 2805
clerk of the county of origin. 2806

which the leasing dealer subleased the motor vehicle, the 2810
sublessee, at the end of the lease agreement or sublease 2811
agreement, or by a manufactured housing broker, the certificate 2812
of title shall be obtained in the name of the buyer by the 2813

who immediately surrenders the certificate of title for 2900

The registrar shall provide, on the certificate of title form 2903
prescribed by section 4505.07 of the Revised Code, language 2904

before the next day on which the offices are open. Every 2961
remittance of tax under division (B)(4) of this section shall be 2962
accompanied by a remittance report in such form as the tax 2963
commissioner prescribes. Upon receipt of a tax remittance and 2964
remittance report, the registrar shall date stamp the report and 2965
forward it to the tax commissioner. If the tax due for any week 2966
is not remitted by a clerk of courts as required under division 2967

designation. If the transferor indicates on the certificate of 2976
title that the odometer reading is not the actual mileage, the 2977
clerk shall enter the phrase "nonactual: warning - odometer 2978
discrepancy" following the mileage designation. The clerk shall 2979
use reasonable care in transferring the information supplied by 2980
the transferor, but is not liable for any errors or omissions of 2981
the clerk or those of the clerk's deputies in the performance of 2982

The registrar shall prescribe an affidavit in which the 2984
transferor shall swear to the true selling price and, except as 2985

of title unless the tax imposed by or pursuant to Chapter 5741. 3008
of the Revised Code based on the purchaser's county of residence 3009
has been paid as evidenced by a receipt issued by the tax 3010
commissioner, or unless the applicant submits with the 3011
application payment of the tax. Upon payment of the tax in 3012
accordance with division (E) of this section, the clerk shall 3013
issue a receipt prescribed by the registrar and agreed upon by 3014
the tax commissioner, showing payment of the tax. 3015
For receiving and disbursing such taxes paid to the clerk 3016
by a resident of the clerk's county, the clerk may retain a 3017
poundage fee of one and one one-hundredth per cent. The clerk 3018
shall not retain a poundage fee from payments of taxes by 3019
persons who do not reside in the clerk's county. 3020
A clerk, however, may retain from the taxes paid to the 3021
clerk an amount equal to the poundage fees associated with 3022
certificates of title issued by other clerks of courts of common 3023
pleas to applicants who reside in the first clerk's county. The 3024
registrar, in consultation with the tax commissioner and the 3025
clerks of the courts of common pleas, shall develop a report 3026
from the automated title processing system that informs each 3027
clerk of the amount of the poundage fees that the clerk is 3028
permitted to retain from those taxes because of certificates of 3029

also may accept payment of the tax by corporate, business, or 3041
personal check, credit card, electronic transfer or wire 3042
transfer, debit card, or any other accepted form of payment made 3043
payable to the clerk. The clerk may require bonds, guarantees, 3044
or letters of credit to ensure the collection of corporate, 3045
business, or personal checks. Any service fee charged by a third 3046
party to a clerk for the use of any form of payment may be paid 3047
by the clerk from the certificate of title administration fund 3048
created in section 325.33 of the Revised Code, or may be 3049
assessed by the clerk upon the applicant as an additional fee. 3050
Upon collection, the additional fees shall be paid by the clerk 3051
into that certificate of title administration fund. 3052
The clerk shall make a good faith effort to collect any 3053
payment of taxes due but not made because the payment was 3054

for the payment of uncollected taxes or uncollected fees. The 3056
clerk shall notify the tax commissioner of any such payment of 3057

Any person who presents payment that is returned or 3065
dishonored for any reason is liable to the clerk for payment of 3066
a penalty over and above the amount of the taxes due. The clerk 3067
shall determine the amount of the penalty, and the penalty shall 3068
be no greater than that amount necessary to compensate the clerk 3069
for banking charges, legal fees, or other expenses incurred by 3070
the clerk in collecting the returned or dishonored payment. The 3071
remedies and procedures provided in this section are in addition 3072
to any other available civil or criminal remedies. Subsequently 3073
collected penalties, poundage fees, and title fees, less any 3074
title fee due the state, from returned or dishonored payments 3075
collected by the clerk shall be paid into the certificate of 3076
title administration fund. Subsequently collected taxes, less 3077
poundage fees, shall be sent by the clerk to the registrar of 3078
motor vehicles at the next scheduled periodic remittance of tax 3079
payments, with information as the commissioner may require. The 3080

(A)(1) The tax shall be collected as provided in section 7442
5739.025 of the Revised Code. The rate of the tax shall be five 7443
and three-fourths per cent. The tax applies and is collectible 7444

consideration for the lease or rental includes amounts that are 7459
not calculated at the time the lease or rental is executed, the 7460

length of the lease period, including any renewal periods, until 7474
the termination penalty or similar provision no longer applies. 7475
The taxpayer shall bear the burden, by a preponderance of the 7476
evidence, that the transaction or series of transactions is not 7477
a sham transaction. 7478
(3) Except as provided in division (A)(2) of this section, 7479
in the case of a sale, the price of which consists in whole or 7480
in part of the lease or rental of tangible personal property, 7481

rental. 7483

application for appointment as a personal representative or 8495
fiduciary waives or bars the disclaimant's right to disclaim a 8496
right, power, privilege, or immunity as a personal 8497
representative or fiduciary or the beneficiary's right to 8498
disclaim property. 8499
