emergency to prevent the physical injury, emotional harm, or 291
neglect of the child. 292
Sec. 2151.419. (A)(1) Except as provided in division (A) 293

Section 17:
2151.314, 2151.33, or 2151.353 of the Revised Code at which the 296
court removes a child from the child's home or continues the 297
removal of a child from the child's home, the court shall 298
determine whether the public children services agency or private 299
child placing agency that filed the complaint in the case, 300
removed the child from home, has custody of the child, or will 301
be given custody of the child has made reasonable efforts to 302
prevent the removal of the child from the child's home, to 303
eliminate the continued removal of the child from the child's 304
home, or to make it possible for the child to return safely 305
home. The agency shall have the burden of proving that it has 306
made those reasonable efforts. If the agency removed the child 307
from home during an emergency in which the child could not 308
safely remain at home and the agency did not have prior contact 309
with the child, the court is not prohibited, solely because the 310
agency did not make reasonable efforts during the emergency to 311
prevent the removal of the child, from determining that the 312
agency made those reasonable efforts. In determining whether 313
reasonable efforts were made, the child's health and safety 314
shall be paramount. 315

2152.72, 3109.58, and 3109.68 of the Revised Code be amended to 8
read as follows: 9
Sec. 2151.27. (A)(1) Subject to division (A)(2) of this 10
section, any person having knowledge of a child who appears to 11
have violated section 2151.87 of the Revised Code or to be a 12
juvenile traffic offender or to be an unruly, abused, neglected, 13
or dependent child may file a sworn complaint with respect to 14
that child in the juvenile court of the county in which the 15
child has a residence or legal settlement or in which the 16
violation, unruliness, abuse, neglect, or dependency allegedly 17
occurred. If an alleged abused, neglected, or dependent child is 18
taken into custody pursuant to division (D)(E) of section 19
2151.31 of the Revised Code or is taken into custody pursuant to 20
division (A) of section 2151.31 of the Revised Code without the 21

filing of a complaint and placed into shelter care pursuant to 22
division (C) of that section, a sworn complaint shall be filed 23
with respect to the child before the end of the next day after 24
the day on which the child was taken into custody. The sworn 25
complaint may be upon information and belief, and, in addition 26
to the allegation that the child committed the violation or is 27
an unruly, abused, neglected, or dependent child, the complaint 28
shall allege the particular facts upon which the allegation that 29
the child committed the violation or is an unruly, abused, 30
neglected, or dependent child is based. 31
(2) Any person having knowledge of a child who appears to 32
be an unruly child for being an habitual truant may file a sworn 33
complaint with respect to that child and the parent, guardian, 34
or other person having care of the child in the juvenile court 35
of the county in which the child has a residence or legal 36
settlement or in which the child is supposed to attend public 37
school. The sworn complaint may be upon information and belief 38
and shall contain the following allegations: 39
(a) That the child is an unruly child for being an 40
habitual truant and, in addition, the particular facts upon 41
which that allegation is based; 42
(b) That the parent, guardian, or other person having care 43
of the child has failed to cause the child's attendance at 44
school in violation of section 3321.38 of the Revised Code and, 45
in addition, the particular facts upon which that allegation is 46
based. 47
(B) If a child, before arriving at the age of eighteen 48
years, allegedly commits an act for which the child may be 49
adjudicated an unruly child and if the specific complaint 50
alleging the act is not filed or a hearing on that specific 51

H. B. No. 532 Page 3

complaint is not held until after the child arrives at the age 52
of eighteen years, the court has jurisdiction to hear and 53
dispose of the complaint as if the complaint were filed and the 54
hearing held before the child arrived at the age of eighteen 55
years. 56
(C) If the complainant in a case in which a child is 57
alleged to be an abused, neglected, or dependent child desires 58
permanent custody of the child or children, temporary custody of 59
the child or children, whether as the preferred or an 60
alternative disposition, or the placement of the child in a 61
planned permanent living arrangement, the complaint shall 62
contain a prayer specifically requesting permanent custody, 63
temporary custody, or the placement of the child in a planned 64
permanent living arrangement. 65
(D) Any person with standing under applicable law may file 66
a complaint for the determination of any other matter over which 67
the juvenile court is given jurisdiction by section 2151.23 of 68
the Revised Code. The complaint shall be filed in the county in 69
which the child who is the subject of the complaint is found or 70
was last known to be found. 71
(E) A public children services agency, acting pursuant to 72
a complaint or an action on a complaint filed under this 73
section, is not subject to the requirements of section 3127.23 74
of the Revised Code. 75
(F) Upon the filing of a complaint alleging that a child 76
is an unruly child, the court may hold the complaint in abeyance 77
pending the child's successful completion of actions that 78
constitute a method to divert the child from the juvenile court 79
system. The method may be adopted by a county pursuant to 80
divisions (D) and (E) of section 121.37 of the Revised Code or 81

H. B. No. 532 Page 4

it may be another method that the court considers satisfactory. 82
If the child completes the actions to the court's satisfaction, 83
the court may dismiss the complaint. If the child fails to 84
complete the actions to the court's satisfaction, the court may 85
consider the complaint. 86
(G) Upon the filing of a complaint that a child is an 87
unruly child that is based solely on a child being an habitual 88
truant, the court shall consider an alternative to adjudication, 89
including actions that constitute a method to divert the child 90
from the juvenile court system, using the Rules of Juvenile 91
Procedure, or by any other means if such an alternative is 92
available to the court and the child has not already 93
participated or failed to complete one of the available 94
alternatives. The court shall consider the complaint only as a 95
matter of last resort. 96
(H) If a complaint that a child is an unruly child based 97
on the child being an habitual truant proceeds to consideration 98
by the court, the prosecution shall bear the burden of proving 99
beyond a reasonable doubt the following: 100
(1) That the child is of compulsory school age, as defined 101

on, any interventions or other alternatives to adjudication as 110

threatened physical or emotional harm from that person. 134

eliminate the continued removal of the child from the child's 304
home, or to make it possible for the child to return safely 305

made those reasonable efforts. If the agency removed the child 307
from home during an emergency in which the child could not 308
safely remain at home and the agency did not have prior contact 309
with the child, the court is not prohibited, solely because the 310
agency did not make reasonable efforts during the emergency to 311
prevent the removal of the child, from determining that the 312
agency made those reasonable efforts. In determining whether 313
reasonable efforts were made, the child's health and safety 314
shall be paramount. 315
