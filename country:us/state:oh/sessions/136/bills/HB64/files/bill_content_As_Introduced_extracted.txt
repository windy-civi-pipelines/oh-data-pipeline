both the purchaser of the illegally obtained hunting license and 123
the clerk or agent who issued the hunting license. Any hunting 124
license issued in violation of this section is void. 125

(2) No person shall issue a fur taker permit, other than 238
an apprentice fur taker permit or an apprentice youth fur taker 239
permit, to an applicant unless the applicant presents to the 240
agent authorized to issue a fur taker permit a previously held 241
hunting license or trapping or fur taker permit or evidence of 242
having held such a license or permit in content and manner 243
approved by the chief of the division of wildlife, a certificate 244
of completion issued upon completion of a trapper education 245
course approved by the chief, or evidence of equivalent training 246
in content and manner approved by the chief. A previously held 247
apprentice hunting license, apprentice fur taker permit, or 248
apprentice youth fur taker permit does not satisfy the 249
requirement concerning the presentation of a previously held 250
hunting license or fur taker permit or evidence of such a 251
license or permit. 252
(3) No person shall issue a fur taker permit, other than 253
an apprentice fur taker permit or an apprentice youth fur taker 254
permit, to any person who fails to present the evidence required 255
by this section. No person shall purchase or obtain a fur taker 256
permit, other than an apprentice fur taker permit or an 257
apprentice youth fur taker permit, without presenting to the 258
issuing agent the evidence required by this section. Issuance of 259
a fur taker permit in violation of the requirements of this 260
section is an offense by both the purchaser of the illegally 261
obtained permit and the clerk or agent who issued the permit. 262
Any fur taker permit issued in violation of this section is 263
void. 264
(E) The chief, with approval of the wildlife council, 265
shall adopt rules prescribing a trapper education course for 266
first-time fur taker permit buyers, other than buyers of 267
apprentice fur taker permits or apprentice youth fur taker 268

of subjects that include, but are not limited to, trapping 270
techniques, animal habits and identification, trapping tradition 271
and ethics, the trapper and conservation, the law in section 272
1533.17 of the Revised Code along with the penalty for its 273
violation, including a description of terms of imprisonment and 274
fines that may be imposed, and other law relating to trapping. 275
Authorized personnel of the division of wildlife or volunteer 276
instructors approved by the chief shall conduct the courses with 277
such frequency and at such locations throughout the state as to 278
reasonably meet the needs of permit applicants. The chief shall 279
issue a certificate of completion to each person who 280
successfully completes the course and passes an examination 281
prescribed by the chief. 282
(F) Every person, while hunting or trapping fur-bearing 283
animals on lands of another, shall carry the person's fur taker 284
permit with the person's signature written on the permit. 285
Failure to carry such a signed permit constitutes an offense 286
under this section. The chief shall adopt any additional rules 287
the chief considers necessary to carry out this section. 288
(G) An owner who is a resident of this state or an owner 289
who is exempt from obtaining a hunting license under section 290
1533.10 of the Revised Code and the children of the owner of 291
lands in this state may hunt or trap fur-bearing animals thereon 292
without a fur taker permit. If the owner of land in this state 293
is a limited liability company or a limited liability 294
partnership that consists of three or fewer individual members 295
or partners, as applicable, an individual member or partner who 296
is a resident of this state and the member's or partner's 297
children of any age may hunt or trap fur-bearing animals on the 298
land owned by the limited liability company or limited liability 299

partnership without a fur taker permit. In addition, if the 300
owner of land in this state is a trust that has a total of three 301
or fewer trustees and beneficiaries, an individual who is a 302
trustee or beneficiary and who is a resident of this state and 303
the individual's children of any age may hunt or trap fur- 304
bearing animals on the land owned by the trust without a fur 305
taker permit. The tenant and children of the tenant may hunt or 306
trap fur-bearing animals on lands where they reside without a 307
fur taker permit. 308
(H) A fur taker permit is not transferable. No person 309
shall carry a fur taker permit issued in the name of another 310
person. 311
(I) A fur taker permit entitles a nonresident to take from 312
this state fur-bearing animals taken and possessed by the 313
nonresident as provided by law or division rule. 314
Sec. 1533.32. (A) Except as provided in this section or 315
division (A)(2) or (C) of section 1533.12 of the Revised Code or 316
as exempted at the discretion of the chief of the division of 317
wildlife, no person, including nonresidents, shall take or catch 318
any fish by angling in any of the waters in the state or engage 319
in fishing in those waters without a license. No person shall 320
take or catch frogs or turtles without a valid fishing license, 321
except as provided in this section. Persons fishing in privately 322
owned ponds, lakes, or reservoirs to or from which fish are not 323
accustomed to migrate are exempt from the license requirements 324
set forth in this section. Persons fishing in privately owned 325
ponds, lakes, or reservoirs that are open to public fishing 326
through an agreement or lease with the division of wildlife 327
shall comply with the license requirements set forth in this 328

tourist's license expiring three days from the effective date of 345
the license to a resident of a state that is not a party to an 346

(2) The chief shall adopt rules under section 1531.10 of 348
the Revised Code providing for the issuance of a one-day fishing 349
license to a resident of this state or of any other state. A 350
one-day fishing license shall allow the holder to take or catch 351
fish by angling in the waters in the state, engage in fishing in 352
those waters, or take or catch frogs or turtles in those waters 353
for one day without obtaining an annual license or a tourist's 354

day fishing license who wishes to obtain an annual license, a 356
clerk or agent authorized to issue licenses under section 357
1533.13 of the Revised Code, not later than the last day on 358
which the one-day license would be valid if it were an annual 359
license, shall credit the amount of the fee paid for the one-day 360

is in or borders on state parks or state-owned lakes, and the 391
spouse and children living with the owner, may take frogs and 392
turtles and may take or catch fish of the kind permitted to be 393
taken or caught from that water without obtaining a license 394
under this section, provided that the state of residence of the 395
owner allows residents of this state owning real property in 396
that state, and the spouse and children living with such a 397
property owner, to take frogs and turtles and take or catch fish 398
without a license. If the owner of such land in this state is a 399
limited liability company or a limited liability partnership 400
that consists of three or fewer individual members or partners, 401
as applicable, an individual member or partner who is a resident 402
