resident of any other state who owns real property in this state, and the spouse and children living

and the spouse and children living with the property owner, to hunt without a license. If the owner of
land in this state is a limited liability company or a limited liability partnership that consists of three

resident of this state and the member's or partner's children of any age and grandchildren under
eighteen years of age may hunt on the land owned by the limited liability company or limited
liability partnership without a hunting license. In addition, if the owner of land in this state is a trust

evidence of having held such a license in content and manner approved by the chief, a certificate of

person who fails to present the evidence required by this section. No person shall purchase or obtain
a hunting license, other than an apprentice hunting license, without presenting to the issuing agent

examination prescribed by the chief.

and grandchildren under eighteen years of age may hunt on the lands without a hunting license. A
resident of any other state who owns real property in this state, and the spouse and children living

residence of the real property owner allows residents of this state owning real property in that state,
and the spouse and children living with the property owner, to hunt without a license. If the owner of
land in this state is a limited liability company or a limited liability partnership that consists of three
or fewer individual members or partners, as applicable, an individual member or partner who is a
resident of this state and the member's or partner's children of any age and grandchildren under
eighteen years of age may hunt on the land owned by the limited liability company or limited
liability partnership without a hunting license. In addition, if the owner of land in this state is a trust
that has a total of three or fewer trustees and beneficiaries, an individual who is a trustee or
beneficiary and who is a resident of this state and the individual's children of any age and
grandchildren under eighteen years of age may hunt on the land owned by the trust without a

them without a hunting license.
(D) The chief of the division of wildlife may issue a small game hunting license expiring
three days from the effective date of the license to a nonresident of the state, the fee for which is
thirty-nine dollars. No person shall take or possess deer, wild turkeys, fur-bearing animals, ducks,
geese, brant, or any nongame animal while possessing only a small game hunting license.
A small game hunting license or an apprentice nonresident hunting license does not
authorize the taking or possessing of ducks, geese, or brant without having obtained, in addition to
the small game hunting license or the apprentice nonresident hunting license, a wetlands habitat

stamp as provided in section 1533.112 of the Revised Code. A small game hunting license or an
apprentice nonresident hunting license does not authorize the taking or possessing of deer, wild

turkeys, or fur-bearing animals in this state shall procure, respectively, a deer or wild turkey permit
as provided in section 1533.11 of the Revised Code or a fur taker permit as provided in section
1533.111 of the Revised Code in addition to a nonresident hunting license, an apprentice nonresident
hunting license, a special youth hunting license, or an apprentice youth hunting license, as
applicable, as provided in this section.

evidence of having held such a license in content and manner approved by the chief, a certificate of
completion issued upon completion of a hunter education and conservation course approved by the
chief, or evidence of equivalent training in content and manner approved by the chief. A previously

previously held hunting license or evidence of it.
(3) No person shall issue a hunting license, except an apprentice hunting license, to any
person who fails to present the evidence required by this section. No person shall purchase or obtain
a hunting license, other than an apprentice hunting license, without presenting to the issuing agent

issue a certificate of completion to each person who successfully completes the course and passes an
examination prescribed by the chief.

or wild turkey problems, and for the stocking, management, and protection of deer or wild turkey.

person's deer or wild turkey permit and exhibit it to any enforcement officer so requesting. Failure to

(6) An owner who is a resident of this state or an owner who is exempt from obtaining a
hunting license under section 1533.10 of the Revised Code and the children of the owner of lands in
this state may hunt deer or wild turkey thereon without a deer or wild turkey permit. If the owner of
land in this state is a limited liability company or a limited liability partnership that consists of three
or fewer individual members or partners, as applicable, an individual member or partner who is a
resident of this state and the member's or partner's children of any age may hunt deer or wild turkey
on the land owned by the limited liability company or limited liability partnership without a deer or
wild turkey permit. In addition, if the owner of land in this state is a trust that has a total of three or
fewer trustees and beneficiaries, an individual who is a trustee or beneficiary and who is a resident

permit or evidence of having held such a license or permit in content and manner approved by the
chief of the division of wildlife, a certificate of completion issued upon completion of a trapper
education course approved by the chief, or evidence of equivalent training in content and manner

owned by the trust without a fur taker permit. The tenant and children of the tenant may hunt or trap
fur-bearing animals on lands where they reside without a fur taker permit.
