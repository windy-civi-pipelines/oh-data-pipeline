sewage disposal system company, is projected to be used and useful as of the date certain, in
rendering the public utility service for which rates are to be fixed and determined. The
Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
26
(b) With respect to an electric light company that chooses to file a forecasted test period
under section 4909.18 of the Revised Code, the valuation of the property of the utility that is
projected to be used and useful during the forecasted test period in rendering the public utility
service for which rates are to be fixed and determined.
(c) The valuation so determined under division (A)(1) of this section for any public utility
shall be the total value as set forth in division (C)(9)(B)(8) of section 4909.042 of the Revised Code
and division (B)(9) of section 4909.05 of the Revised Code, and a reasonable allowance for
materials and supplies and a reasonable allowance for cash working capital as determined by the
commission.
The commission, in its discretion, may include in the valuation a reasonable allowance for
construction work in progress but, in no event, may such an allowance be made by the commission
until it has determined that the particular construction project is at least seventy-five per cent
complete.
In determining the percentage completion of a particular construction project, the
commission shall consider, among other relevant criteria, the per cent of time elapsed in
construction; the per cent of construction funds, excluding allowance for funds used during
construction, expended, or obligated to such construction funds budgeted where all such funds are
adjusted to reflect current purchasing power; and any physical inspection performed by or on behalf
of any party, including the commission's staff.
A reasonable allowance for construction work in progress shall not exceed ten per cent of the
total valuation as stated in this division, not including such allowance for construction work in
progress.
Where the commission permits an allowance for construction work in progress, the dollar
value of the project or portion thereof included in the valuation as construction work in progress
shall not be included in the valuation as plant in service until such time as the total revenue effect of
the construction work in progress allowance is offset by the total revenue effect of the plant in
service exclusion. Carrying charges calculated in a manner similar to allowance for funds used
during construction shall accrue on that portion of the project in service but not reflected in rates as
plant in service, and such accrued carrying charges shall be included in the valuation of the property
at the conclusion of the offset period for purposes of division (C)(9) of section 4909.05 of the
Revised Code.
From and after April 10, 1985, no allowance for construction work in progress as it relates to
a particular construction project shall be reflected in rates for a period exceeding forty-eight
consecutive months commencing on the date the initial rates reflecting such allowance become
effective, except as otherwise provided in this division.
The applicable maximum period in rates for an allowance for construction work in progress
as it relates to a particular construction project shall be tolled if, and to the extent, a delay in the in-
service date of the project is caused by the action or inaction of any federal, state, county, or
Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
27
municipal agency having jurisdiction, where such action or inaction relates to a change in a rule,
standard, or approval of such agency, and where such action or inaction is not the result of the
failure of the utility to reasonably endeavor to comply with any rule, standard, or approval prior to
such change.
In the event that such period expires before the project goes into service, the commission
shall exclude, from the date of expiration, the allowance for the project as construction work in
progress from rates, except that the commission may extend the expiration date up to twelve months
for good cause shown.
In the event that a utility has permanently canceled, abandoned, or terminated construction
of a project for which it was previously permitted a construction work in progress allowance, the
commission immediately shall exclude the allowance for the project from the valuation.
In the event that a construction work in progress project previously included in the valuation
is removed from the valuation pursuant to this division, any revenues collected by the utility from its
customers after April 10, 1985, that resulted from such prior inclusion shall be offset against future
revenues over the same period of time as the project was included in the valuation as construction
work in progress. The total revenue effect of such offset shall not exceed the total revenues
previously collected.
In no event shall the total revenue effect of any offset or offsets provided under division (A)
(1) of this section exceed the total revenue effect of any construction work in progress allowance.
(2) A fair and reasonable rate of return to the utility on the valuation as determined in
division (A)(1) of this section;
(3) The dollar annual return to which the utility is entitled by applying the fair and
reasonable rate of return as determined under division (A)(2) of this section to the valuation of the
utility determined under division (A)(1) of this section;
(4) The cost to the utility of rendering the public utility service for the test period used for
the determination under division (C)(1) of this section, less the total of any interest on cash or credit
refunds paid, pursuant to section 4909.42 of the Revised Code, by the utility during the test period.
(a) Federal, state, and local taxes imposed on or measured by net income may, in the
discretion of the commission, be computed by the normalization method of accounting, provided the
utility maintains accounting reserves that reflect differences between taxes actually payable and
taxes on a normalized basis, provided that no determination as to the treatment in the rate-making
process of such taxes shall be made that will result in loss of any tax depreciation or other tax benefit
to which the utility would otherwise be entitled, and further provided that such tax benefit as
redounds to the utility as a result of such a computation may not be retained by the company, used to
fund any dividend or distribution, or utilized for any purpose other than the defrayal of the operating
expenses of the utility and the defrayal of the expenses of the utility in connection with construction
work.
(b) The amount of any tax credits granted to an electric light company under section
Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
28

Section 41:
5727.391 of the Revised Code for Ohio coal burned prior to January 1, 2000, shall not be retained by
the company, used to fund any dividend or distribution, or utilized for any purposes other than the
defrayal of the allowable operating expenses of the company and the defrayal of the allowable
expenses of the company in connection with the installation, acquisition, construction, or use of a
compliance facility. The amount of the tax credits granted to an electric light company under that

Section 42:
section for Ohio coal burned prior to January 1, 2000, shall be returned to its customers within three
years after initially claiming the credit through an offset to the company's rates or fuel component, as
determined by the commission, as set forth in schedules filed by the company under section 4905.30
of the Revised Code. As used in division (A)(4)(b) of this section, "compliance facility" has the
same meaning as in section 5727.391 of the Revised Code.
(B) The commission shall compute the gross annual revenues to which the utility is entitled
by adding the dollar amount of return under division (A)(3) of this section to the cost, for the test
period used for the determination under division (C)(1) of this section, of rendering the public utility
service under division (A)(4) of this section.
(C)(1) Except as provided in division (D) of this section, the revenues and expenses of the
utility shall be determined during a test period. The utility may as follows:
(a) Electric light companies may propose a forecasted test period. If the company proposes a
forecasted test period, the company shall propose annual base rates for three consecutive twelve-
month periods in a single forecasted test period application.
During the first twelve-month period, the company shall propose a reasonably forecasted
rate base using a thirteen-month average, revenues, and expenses for the first twelve months that
new base rates will be in effect.
During the second twelve-month period, the base rate revenue requirement shall be adjusted
for the return of, and return on, incremental rate base additions approved by the commission in the
initial application. During the third twelve-month period, the base rate revenue requirement shall be
adjusted for the return of and return on incremental rate base additions approved by the commission
in the initial application.
For each twelve-month period, forecasted plant investment, forecasted revenues, and
forecasted expenses versus actual investment, actual revenues, and actual expenses shall be trued up
via a cost recovery mechanism approved by the commission.
Each true-up process shall include an adjustment to actual for the rate of return that the
company is authorized to earn on the actual investments made. The company shall provide the
commission with actual financial information during the true-up process to ensure accuracy. As part
of the true-up process, the commission shall include only rate base components that have been found
by the commission to be used and useful in rendering public utility service.
At the end of the last test period, the company shall file for a rate case under section 4909.18
of the Revised Code.
(b) All utilities, except for electric light companies that choose to file under division (C)(1)
Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
29
(a) of this section, shall propose a test period for this determination that is any twelve-month period
beginning not more than six months prior to the date the application is filed and ending not more
than nine months subsequent to that date. The test period for determining revenues and expenses of
the utility shall be the test period proposed by the utility, unless otherwise ordered by the
commission.
(2) The For utilities filing under division (C)(1)(b) of this section, the date certain shall be
not later than the date of filing, except that it shall be, for a natural gas, water-works, or sewage
disposal system company, not later than the end of the test period.
(D) A natural gas, water-works, or sewage disposal system company Utilities filing under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section may propose adjustments to the revenues and expenses to be
determined under division (C)(1) of this section for any changes that are, during the test period or
the twelve-month period immediately following the test period, reasonably expected to occur. The
natural gas, water-works, or sewage disposal system company utility shall identify and quantify,
individually, any proposed adjustments. The commission shall incorporate the proposed adjustments
into the determination if the adjustments are just and reasonable.
(E) When the commission is of the opinion, after hearing and after making the
determinations under divisions (A) and (B) of this section, that any rate, fare, charge, toll, rental,
schedule, classification, or service, or any joint rate, fare, charge, toll, rental, schedule, classification,
or service rendered, charged, demanded, exacted, or proposed to be rendered, charged, demanded, or
exacted, is, or will be, unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory, unjustly preferential, or in
violation of law, that the service is, or will be, inadequate, or that the maximum rates, charges, tolls,
or rentals chargeable by any such public utility are insufficient to yield reasonable compensation for
the service rendered, and are unjust and unreasonable, the commission shall:

actually used and useful for the convenience of the public as determined under division (A)(1) of
this section, excluding from such value the value of any franchise or right to own, operate, or enjoy

section, and order such just and reasonable rate, fare, charge, toll, rental, or service to be substituted
for the existing one. After such determination and order no change in the rate, fare, toll, charge,

(3) A published source of information is available publicly or through subscription that
identifies pricing information for traded electricity on- and off-peak energy products that are
contracts for delivery beginning at least two years from the date of the publication and is updated on
a regular basis.
The commission shall initiate a proceeding and, within ninety days after the application's
filing date, shall determine by order whether the electric distribution utility and its market-rate offer
meet all of the foregoing requirements. If the finding is positive, the electric distribution utility may
shall initiate its competitive bidding process. If the finding is negative as to one or more
requirements, the commission in the order shall direct the electric distribution utility regarding how
any deficiency may shall be timely remedied in a timely manner to the commission's satisfaction;
otherwise, the electric distribution utility shall withdraw the application. However, if such remedy is
made and the subsequent finding is positive and also if the electric distribution utility made a
simultaneous filing under this section and section 4928.143 of the Revised Code, the utility shall not
initiate its competitive bid until at least one hundred fifty days after the filing date of those
applications.
(C) Upon the completion of the competitive bidding process authorized by divisions (A) and
(B) of this section, including for the purpose of division (D) of this section, the commission shall
select the least-cost bid winner or winners of that process, and such selected bid or bids, as
prescribed as retail rates by the commission, shall be the electric distribution utility's standard
service offer unless the commission, by order issued before the third calendar day following the
conclusion of the competitive bidding process for the market rate offer, determines that one or more
Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
53
of the following criteria were not met:
(1) Each portion of the bidding process was oversubscribed, such that the amount of supply
bid upon was greater than the amount of the load bid out.
(2) There were four or more bidders.
(3) At least twenty-five per cent of the load is bid upon by one or more persons other than
the electric distribution utility.
All costs incurred by the electric distribution utility as a result of or related to the
competitive bidding process or to procuring generation service to provide the standard service offer,
including the costs of energy and capacity and the costs of all other products and services procured
as a result of the competitive bidding process, shall be timely recovered through the standard service
offer price, and, for that purpose, the commission shall approve a reconciliation mechanism, other
recovery mechanism, or a combination of such mechanisms for the utility.
(D) The first application filed under this section by an electric distribution utility that, as of
July 31, 2008, directly owns, in whole or in part, operating electric generating facilities that had been
used and useful in this state shall require that a portion of that the utility's standard service offer load
for the first five years of the market rate offer be competitively bid under division (A) of this section
as follows: ten per cent of the load in year one, not more than twenty per cent in year two, thirty per
cent in year three, forty per cent in year four, and fifty per cent in year five. Consistent with those
percentages, the commission shall determine the actual percentages for each year of years one
through five. The standard service offer price for retail electric generation service under this first
application shall be a proportionate blend of the bid price and the generation service price for the
remaining standard service offer load, which latter price shall be equal to the electric distribution
utility's most recent standard service offer price, adjusted upward or downward as the commission
determines reasonable, relative to the jurisdictional portion of any known and measurable changes
from the level of any one or more of the following costs as reflected in that most recent standard
service offer price:
(1) The electric distribution utility's prudently incurred cost of fuel used to produce
electricity;
(2) Its prudently incurred purchased power costs;
(3) Its prudently incurred costs of satisfying the supply and demand portfolio requirements
of this state, including, but not limited to, renewable energy resource and energy efficiency
requirements;
(4) Its costs prudently incurred to comply with environmental laws and regulations, with
consideration of the derating of any facility associated with those costs.
In making any adjustment to the most recent standard service offer price on the basis of costs
described in division (D) of this section, the commission shall include the benefits that may become
available to the electric distribution utility as a result of or in connection with the costs included in
the adjustment, including, but not limited to, the utility's receipt of emissions credits or its receipt of
Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
54
tax benefits or of other benefits, and, accordingly, the commission may impose such conditions on
the adjustment to ensure that any such benefits are properly aligned with the associated cost
responsibility. The commission shall also determine how such adjustments will affect the electric
distribution utility's return on common equity that may be achieved by those adjustments. The
commission shall not apply its consideration of the return on common equity to reduce any
adjustments authorized under this division unless the adjustments will cause the electric distribution
utility to earn a return on common equity that is significantly in excess of the return on common
equity that is earned by publicly traded companies, including utilities, that face comparable business
and financial risk, with such adjustments for capital structure as may be appropriate. The burden of
proof for demonstrating that significantly excessive earnings will not occur shall be on the electric
distribution utility.
Additionally, the commission may adjust the electric distribution utility's most recent
standard service offer price by such just and reasonable amount that the commission determines
necessary to address any emergency that threatens the utility's financial integrity or to ensure that the
resulting revenue available to the utility for providing the standard service offer is not so inadequate
as to result, directly or indirectly, in a taking of property without compensation pursuant to Section
19 of Article I, Ohio Constitution. The electric distribution utility has the burden of demonstrating
that any adjustment to its most recent standard service offer price is proper in accordance with this
division.
(E) Beginning in the second year of a blended price under division (D) of this section and
notwithstanding any other requirement of this section, the commission may alter prospectively the
proportions specified in that division to mitigate any effect of an abrupt or significant change in the
electric distribution utility's standard service offer price that would otherwise result in general or
with respect to any rate group or rate schedule but for such alteration. Any such alteration shall be
made not more often than annually, and the commission shall not, by altering those proportions and
in any event, including because of the length of time, as authorized under division (C) of this

Section 62:
section, taken to approve the market rate offer, cause the duration of the blending period to exceed
ten years as counted from the effective date of the approved market rate offer. Additionally, any
such alteration shall be limited to an alteration affecting the prospective proportions used during the
blending period and shall not affect any blending proportion previously approved and applied by the
commission under this division.
(F) An electric distribution utility that has received commission approval of its first
application under division (C) of this section shall not, nor ever shall be authorized or required by
the commission to, file an application under section 4928.143 of the Revised Code.
Sec. 4928.144. The public utilities commission by order may authorize any just and
reasonable phase-in of any electric distribution utility rate or price established under sections

Section 63:
4928.141 to 4928.143 and 4928.142 of the Revised Code, and inclusive of carrying charges, as the
commission considers necessary to ensure rate or price stability for consumers. If the commission's
Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
55
order includes such a phase-in, the order also shall provide for the creation of regulatory assets
pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, by authorizing the deferral of incurred costs
equal to the amount not collected, plus carrying charges on that amount. Further, the order shall
authorize the collection of those deferrals through a nonbypassable surcharge on any such rate or
price so established for the electric distribution utility by the commission.
Sec. 4928.149. No electric distribution utility may use any electric energy storage system to
participate in the wholesale market, if the utility purchased or acquired that system for distribution
service.
Sec. 4928.1410. If an electric distribution utility has an existing electric security plan under
which the commission had authorized the creation or continuation of riders, then, to the extent those
riders will cease to exist after termination of the electric security plan, the electric distribution utility
is authorized to create necessary regulatory assets or liabilities, along with carrying costs at the
utility's weighted average cost of debt, for the resolution of any outstanding under-collection or
over-collection of funds under such riders. The resolution of such regulatory assets or liabilities shall
be addressed in the first distribution rate case under section 4909.18 of the Revised Code that occurs
after the plan's expiration.
Sec. 4928.17. (A) Except as otherwise provided in sections 4928.141 or 4928.142 or

Section 64:
4928.143 or 4928.31 to 4928.40 of the Revised Code and beginning on the starting date of
competitive retail electric service, no electric utility shall engage in this state, either directly or
through an affiliate, in the businesses of supplying a noncompetitive retail electric service and
supplying a competitive retail electric service, or in the businesses of supplying a noncompetitive
retail electric service and supplying a product or service other than retail electric service, unless the
utility implements and operates under a corporate separation plan that is approved by the public
utilities commission under this section, is consistent with the policy specified in section 4928.02 of
the Revised Code, and achieves all of the following:
(1) The plan provides, at minimum, for the provision of the competitive retail electric service
or the nonelectric product or service through a fully separated affiliate of the utility, and the plan
includes separate accounting requirements, the code of conduct as ordered by the commission
pursuant to a rule it shall adopt under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the Revised Code, and such
other measures as are necessary to effectuate the policy specified in section 4928.02 of the Revised
Code.
(2) The plan satisfies the public interest in preventing unfair competitive advantage and
preventing the abuse of market power.
(3) The plan is sufficient to ensure that the utility will not extend any undue preference or
advantage to any affiliate, division, or part of its own business engaged in the business of supplying
the competitive retail electric service or nonelectric product or service, including, but not limited to,
utility resources such as trucks, tools, office equipment, office space, supplies, customer and
marketing information, advertising, billing and mailing systems, personnel, and training, without
Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
56
compensation based upon fully loaded embedded costs charged to the affiliate; and to ensure that
any such affiliate, division, or part will not receive undue preference or advantage from any affiliate,
division, or part of the business engaged in business of supplying the noncompetitive retail electric
service. No such utility, affiliate, division, or part shall extend such undue preference.
Notwithstanding any other division of this section, a utility's obligation under division (A)(3) of this

Section 65:
section shall be effective January 1, 2000.
(B) The commission may approve, modify and approve, or disapprove a corporate separation
plan filed with the commission under division (A) of this section. As part of the code of conduct
required under division (A)(1) of this section, the commission shall adopt rules pursuant to division
(A) of section 4928.06 of the Revised Code regarding corporate separation and procedures for plan
filing and approval. The rules shall include limitations on affiliate practices solely for the purpose of
maintaining a separation of the affiliate's business from the business of the utility to prevent unfair
competitive advantage abuse of market power by virtue of that relationship. The rules also shall
include an opportunity for any person having a real and substantial interest in the corporate
separation plan to file specific objections to the plan and propose specific responses to issues raised
in the objections, which objections and responses the commission shall address in its final order.
Prior to commission approval of the plan, the commission shall afford a hearing upon those aspects
of the plan that the commission determines reasonably require a hearing. The commission may reject
and require refiling of a substantially inadequate plan under this section.
(C) The commission shall issue an order approving or modifying and approving a corporate
separation plan under this section, to be effective on the date specified in the order, only upon
findings that the plan reasonably complies with the requirements of division (A) of this section and
will provide for ongoing compliance with the policy specified in section 4928.02 of the Revised
Code. However, for good cause shown, the commission may issue an order approving or modifying
and approving a corporate separation plan under this section that does not comply with division (A)
(1) of this section but complies with such functional separation requirements as the commission
authorizes to apply for an interim period prescribed in the order, upon a finding that such alternative
plan will provide for ongoing compliance with the policy specified in section 4928.02 of the Revised
Code.
(D) Any party may seek an amendment to a corporate separation plan approved under this

Section 66:
section, and the commission, pursuant to a request from any party or on its own initiative, may order
as it considers necessary the filing of an amended corporate separation plan to reflect changed
circumstances.
(E) No electric distribution utility shall sell or transfer any generating asset it wholly or
partly owns at any time without obtaining prior commission approval.
Sec. 4928.20. (A) The legislative authority of a municipal corporation may adopt an
ordinance, or the board of township trustees of a township or the board of county commissioners of a
county may adopt a resolution, under which, on or after the starting date of competitive retail electric
Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
57
service, it may aggregate in accordance with this section the retail electrical loads located,
respectively, within the municipal corporation, township, or unincorporated area of the county and,
for that purpose, may enter into service agreements to facilitate for those loads the sale and purchase
of electricity. The legislative authority or board also may exercise such authority jointly with any
other such legislative authority or board. For customers that are not mercantile customers, an
ordinance or resolution under this division shall specify whether the aggregation will occur only
with the prior, affirmative consent of each person owning, occupying, controlling, or using an
electric load center proposed to be aggregated or will occur automatically for all such persons
pursuant to the opt-out requirements of division (D) of this section. The aggregation of mercantile
customers shall occur only with the prior, affirmative consent of each such person owning,
occupying, controlling, or using an electric load center proposed to be aggregated. Nothing in this
division, however, authorizes the aggregation of the retail electric loads of an electric load center, as
defined in section 4933.81 of the Revised Code, that is located in the certified territory of a nonprofit
electric supplier under sections 4933.81 to 4933.90 of the Revised Code or an electric load center
served by transmission or distribution facilities of a municipal electric utility.
(B) If an ordinance or resolution adopted under division (A) of this section specifies that
aggregation of customers that are not mercantile customers will occur automatically as described in
that division, the ordinance or resolution shall direct the board of elections to submit the question of
the authority to aggregate to the electors of the respective municipal corporation, township, or
unincorporated area of a county at a special election on the day of the next primary or general
election in the municipal corporation, township, or county. The legislative authority or board shall
certify a copy of the ordinance or resolution to the board of elections not less than ninety days before
the day of the special election. No ordinance or resolution adopted under division (A) of this section
that provides for an election under this division shall take effect unless approved by a majority of the
electors voting upon the ordinance or resolution at the election held pursuant to this division.
(C) Upon the applicable requisite authority under divisions (A) and (B) of this section, the
legislative authority or board shall develop a plan of operation and governance for the aggregation
program so authorized. Before adopting a plan under this division, the legislative authority or board
shall hold at least two public hearings on the plan. Before the first hearing, the legislative authority
or board shall publish notice of the hearings once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper
of general circulation in the jurisdiction or as provided in section 7.16 of the Revised Code. The
notice shall summarize the plan and state the date, time, and location of each hearing.
(D) No legislative authority or board, pursuant to an ordinance or resolution under divisions
(A) and (B) of this section that provides for automatic aggregation of customers that are not
mercantile customers as described in division (A) of this section, shall aggregate the electrical load
of any electric load center located within its jurisdiction unless it in advance clearly discloses to the
person owning, occupying, controlling, or using the load center that the person will be enrolled
automatically in the aggregation program and will remain so enrolled unless the person affirmatively
Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
58
elects by a stated procedure not to be so enrolled. The disclosure shall state prominently the rates,
charges, and other terms and conditions of enrollment. The stated procedure shall allow any person
enrolled in the aggregation program the opportunity to opt out of the program every three years,
without paying a switching fee. Any such person that opts out before the commencement of the
aggregation program pursuant to the stated procedure shall default to the standard service offer
provided under section 4928.14 or division (D) of section 4928.35 of the Revised Code until the
person chooses an alternative supplier.
(E)(1) With respect to a governmental aggregation for a municipal corporation that is
authorized pursuant to divisions (A) to (D) of this section, resolutions may be proposed by initiative
or referendum petitions in accordance with sections 731.28 to 731.41 of the Revised Code.
(2) With respect to a governmental aggregation for a township or the unincorporated area of
a county, which aggregation is authorized pursuant to divisions (A) to (D) of this section, resolutions
may be proposed by initiative or referendum petitions in accordance with sections 731.28 to 731.40
of the Revised Code, except that:
(a) The petitions shall be filed, respectively, with the township fiscal officer or the board of
county commissioners, who shall perform those duties imposed under those sections upon the city
auditor or village clerk.
(b) The petitions shall contain the signatures of not less than ten per cent of the total number
of electors in, respectively, the township or the unincorporated area of the county who voted for the
office of governor at the preceding general election for that office in that area.
(F) A governmental aggregator under division (A) of this section is not a public utility
engaging in the wholesale purchase and resale of electricity, and provision of the aggregated service
is not a wholesale utility transaction. A governmental aggregator shall be subject to supervision and
regulation by the public utilities commission only to the extent of any competitive retail electric
service it provides and commission authority under this chapter.
(G) This section does not apply in the case of a municipal corporation that supplies such
aggregated service to electric load centers to which its municipal electric utility also supplies a
noncompetitive retail electric service through transmission or distribution facilities the utility singly
or jointly owns or operates.
(H) A governmental aggregator shall not include in its aggregation the accounts of any of the
following:
(1) A customer that has opted out of the aggregation;
(2) A customer in contract with a certified electric services company;
(3) A customer that has a special contract with an electric distribution utility;
(4) A customer that is not located within the governmental aggregator's governmental
boundaries;
(5) Subject to division (C) of section 4928.21 of the Revised Code, a customer who appears
on the "do not aggregate" list maintained under that section.
Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
59
(I) Customers that are part of a governmental aggregation under this section shall be
responsible only for such portion of a surcharge under section 4928.144 of the Revised Code that is
proportionate to the benefits, as determined by the commission, that electric load centers within the
jurisdiction of the governmental aggregation as a group receive. The proportionate surcharge so
established shall apply to each customer of the governmental aggregation while the customer is part
of that aggregation. If a customer ceases being such a customer, the otherwise applicable surcharge
shall apply. Nothing in this section shall result in less than full recovery by an electric distribution
utility of any surcharge authorized under section 4928.144 of the Revised Code. Nothing in this

Section 67:
section shall result in less than the full and timely imposition, charging, collection, and adjustment
by an electric distribution utility, its assignee, or any collection agent, of the phase-in-recovery
charges authorized pursuant to a final financing order issued pursuant to sections 4928.23 to

Section 68:
4928.2318 of the Revised Code.
(J) On behalf of the customers that are part of a governmental aggregation under this section
and by filing written notice with the public utilities commission, the legislative authority that formed
or is forming that governmental aggregation may elect not to receive standby service within the
meaning of division (B)(2)(d) of section 4928.143 of the Revised Code from an electric distribution
utility in whose certified territory the governmental aggregation is located and that operates under an
approved electric security plan under that section. Upon the filing of that notice, the electric
distribution utility shall not charge any such customer to whom competitive retail electric generation
service is provided by another supplier under the governmental aggregation for the standby service.
Any such consumer that returns to the utility for competitive retail electric service shall pay the
market price of power incurred by the utility to serve that consumer plus any amount attributable to
the utility's cost of compliance with the renewable energy resource provisions of section 4928.64 of
the Revised Code to serve the consumer. Such market price shall include, but not be limited to,
capacity and energy charges; all charges associated with the provision of that power supply through
the regional transmission organization, including, but not limited to, transmission, ancillary services,
congestion, and settlement and administrative charges; and all other costs incurred by the utility that
are associated with the procurement, provision, and administration of that power supply, as such
costs may be approved by the commission. The period of time during which the market price and
renewable energy resource amount shall be so assessed on the consumer shall be from the time the
consumer so returns to the electric distribution utility until the expiration of the electric security
plan. However, if that period of time is expected to be more than two years, the commission may
reduce the time period to a period of not less than two years.
(K) The commission shall adopt rules and issue orders in proceedings under sections

Section 69:
4928.141 and 4928.142 of the Revised Code to encourage and promote large-scale governmental
aggregation in this state. For that purpose, the commission shall conduct an immediate review of any
rules it has adopted for the purpose of this section that are in effect on the effective date of the
amendment of this section by S.B. 221 of the 127th general assembly, July 31, 2008. Further, within
Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
60
the context of an electric security plan under section 4928.143 of the Revised Code, the The
commission shall consider the effect on large-scale governmental aggregation of any nonbypassable
generation charges, however collected, that would be established under that plan, except any
nonbypassable generation charges that relate to any cost incurred by the review each application
filed under section 4928.142 of the Revised Code by an electric distribution utility, to ensure that the
deferral of which has been authorized by the commission prior to the effective date of application
and the amendment of this section by S.B. 221 of the 127th general assembly, July 31, 2008
resulting market rate offer shall not contain any rate, price, term, condition, or provision that would
have an adverse effect on large-scale governmental aggregation in this state.

commission shall issue either a financing order, granting the application in whole or with
Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
64
modifications, or an order suspending or rejecting the application.
(2) If the commission suspends an application for a financing order, the commission shall
notify the electric distribution utility of the suspension and may direct the electric distribution utility
to provide additional information as the commission considers necessary to evaluate the application.
Not later than ninety days after the suspension, the commission shall issue either a financing order,
granting the application in whole or with modifications, or an order rejecting the application.
(D)(1) The commission shall not issue a financing order under division (C) of this section
unless the commission determines that the financing order is consistent with section 4928.02 of the
Revised Code.
(2) Except as provided in division (D)(1) of this section, the commission shall issue a
financing order under division (C) of this section if, at the time the financing order is issued, the
commission finds that the issuance of the phase-in-recovery bonds and the phase-in-recovery
charges authorized by the order results in, consistent with market conditions, both measurably
enhancing cost savings to customers and mitigating rate impacts to customers as compared with
traditional financing mechanisms or traditional cost-recovery methods available to the electric
distribution utility or, if the commission previously approved a recovery method, as compared with
that recovery method.
(E) The commission shall include all of the following in a financing order issued under

(F) The commission may, in a financing order, afford the electric distribution utility
flexibility in establishing the terms and conditions for the phase-in-recovery bonds to accommodate
Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
65
changes in market conditions, including repayment schedules, interest rates, financing costs,
collateral requirements, required debt service and other reserves, and the ability of the electric
distribution utility, at its option, to effect a series of issuances of phase-in-recovery bonds and
correlated assignments, sales, pledges, or other transfers of phase-in-recovery property. Any changes
made under this section to terms and conditions for the phase-in-recovery bonds shall be in
conformance with the financing order.
(G) A financing order may provide that the creation of phase-in-recovery property shall be
simultaneous with the sale of that property to an assignee as provided in the application and the
pledge of the property to secure phase-in-recovery bonds.
(H) The commission shall, in a financing order, require that after the final terms of each
issuance of phase-in-recovery bonds have been established, and prior to the issuance of those bonds,
the electric distribution utility shall determine the resulting phase-in-recovery charges in accordance
with the adjustment mechanism described in the financing order. These phase-in-recovery charges
shall be final and effective upon the issuance of the phase-in-recovery bonds, without further
commission action.
Sec. 4928.34. (A) The public utilities commission shall not approve or prescribe a transition
plan under division (A) or (B) of section 4928.33 of the Revised Code unless the commission first
makes all of the following determinations:
(1) The unbundled components for the electric transmission component of retail electric
service, as specified in the utility's rate unbundling plan required by division (A)(1) of section

Section 77:
4928.31 of the Revised Code, equal the tariff rates determined by the federal energy regulatory
commission that are in effect on the date of the approval of the transition plan under sections

Section 78:
4928.31 to 4928.40 of the Revised Code, as each such rate is determined applicable to each
particular customer class and rate schedule by the commission. The unbundled transmission
component shall include a sliding scale of charges under division (B) of section 4905.31 of the
Revised Code to ensure that refunds determined or approved by the federal energy regulatory
commission are flowed through to retail electric customers.
(2) The unbundled components for retail electric distribution service in the rate unbundling
plan equal the difference between the costs attributable to the utility's transmission and distribution
rates and charges under its schedule of rates and charges in effect on the effective date of this

Section 79:
section, based upon the record in the most recent rate proceeding of the utility for which the utility's
schedule was established, and the tariff rates for electric transmission service determined by the
federal energy regulatory commission as described in division (A)(1) of this section.
(3) All other unbundled components required by the commission in the rate unbundling plan
equal the costs attributable to the particular service as reflected in the utility's schedule of rates and
charges in effect on the effective date of this section.
(4) The unbundled components for retail electric generation service in the rate unbundling
plan equal the residual amount remaining after the determination of the transmission, distribution,
Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
66
and other unbundled components, and after any adjustments necessary to reflect the effects of the
amendment of section 5727.111 of the Revised Code by Sub. S.B. No. 3 of the 123rd general
assembly.
(5) All unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan have been adjusted to reflect any
base rate reductions on file with the commission and as scheduled to be in effect by December 31,
2005, under rate settlements in effect on the effective date of this section. However, all earnings
obligations, restrictions, or caps imposed on an electric utility in a commission order prior to the
effective date of this section are void.
(6) Subject to division (A)(5) of this section, the total of all unbundled components in the
rate unbundling plan are capped and shall equal during the market development period, except as
specifically provided in this chapter, the total of all rates and charges in effect under the applicable
bundled schedule of the electric utility pursuant to section 4905.30 of the Revised Code in effect on
the day before the effective date of this section, including the transition charge determined under

Section 80:
section 4928.40 of the Revised Code, adjusted for any changes in the taxation of electric utilities and
retail electric service under Sub. S.B. No. 3 of the 123rd General Assembly, the universal service
rider authorized by section 4928.51 of the Revised Code, and the temporary rider authorized by

Section 81:
section 4928.61 of the Revised Code. For the purpose of this division, the rate cap applicable to a
customer receiving electric service pursuant to an arrangement approved by the commission under

Section 82:
section 4905.31 of the Revised Code is, for the term of the arrangement, the total of all rates and
charges in effect under the arrangement. For any rate schedule filed pursuant to section 4905.30 of
the Revised Code or any arrangement subject to approval pursuant to section 4905.31 of the Revised
Code, the initial tax-related adjustment to the rate cap required by this division shall be equal to the
rate of taxation specified in section 5727.81 of the Revised Code and applicable to the schedule or
arrangement. To the extent such total annual amount of the tax-related adjustment is greater than or
less than the comparable amount of the total annual tax reduction experienced by the electric utility
as a result of the provisions of Sub. S.B. No. 3 of the 123rd general assembly, such difference shall
be addressed by the commission through accounting procedures, refunds, or an annual surcharge or
credit to customers, or through other appropriate means, to avoid placing the financial responsibility
for the difference upon the electric utility or its shareholders. Any adjustments in the rate of taxation
specified in section 5727.81 of the Revised Code section shall not occur without a corresponding
adjustment to the rate cap for each such rate schedule or arrangement. The department of taxation
shall advise the commission and self-assessors under section 5727.81 of the Revised Code prior to
the effective date of any change in the rate of taxation specified under that section, and the
commission shall modify the rate cap to reflect that adjustment so that the rate cap adjustment is
effective as of the effective date of the change in the rate of taxation. This division shall be applied,
to the extent possible, to eliminate any increase in the price of electricity for customers that
otherwise may occur as a result of establishing the taxes contemplated in section 5727.81 of the
Revised Code.
Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
67
(7) The rate unbundling plan complies with any rules adopted by the commission under
division (A) of section 4928.06 of the Revised Code.
(8) The corporate separation plan required by division (A)(2) of section 4928.31 of the
Revised Code complies with section 4928.17 of the Revised Code and any rules adopted by the
commission under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the Revised Code.
(9) Any plan or plans the commission requires to address operational support systems and
any other technical implementation issues pertaining to competitive retail electric service comply
with any rules adopted by the commission under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the Revised
Code.
(10) The employee assistance plan required by division (A)(4) of section 4928.31 of the
Revised Code sufficiently provides severance, retraining, early retirement, retention, outplacement,
and other assistance for the utility's employees whose employment is affected by electric industry
restructuring under this chapter.
(11) The consumer education plan required under division (A)(5) of section 4928.31 of the
Revised Code complies with former section 4928.42 of the Revised Code and any rules adopted by
the commission under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the Revised Code.
(12) The transition revenues for which an electric utility is authorized a revenue opportunity
under sections 4928.31 to 4928.40 of the Revised Code are the allowable transition costs of the
utility as such costs are determined by the commission pursuant to section 4928.39 of the Revised
Code, and the transition charges for the customer classes and rate schedules of the utility are the
charges determined pursuant to section 4928.40 of the Revised Code.
(13) Any independent transmission plan included in the transition plan filed under section

Section 83:
4928.31 of the Revised Code reasonably complies with section 4928.12 of the Revised Code and
any rules adopted by the commission under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the Revised Code,
unless the commission, for good cause shown, authorizes the utility to defer compliance until an
order is issued under division (G) of section 4928.35 of the Revised Code.
(14) The utility is in compliance with sections 4928.01 to 4928.11 of the Revised Code and
any rules or orders of the commission adopted or issued under those sections.
(15) All unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan have been adjusted to reflect the
elimination of the tax on gross receipts imposed by section 5727.30 of the Revised Code.
In addition, a transition plan approved by the commission under section 4928.33 of the
Revised Code but not containing an approved independent transmission plan shall contain the
express conditions that the utility will comply with an order issued under division (G) of section

Section 84:
4928.35 of the Revised Code.
(B) Subject to division (E) of section 4928.17 of the Revised Code, if If the commission
finds that any part of the transition plan would constitute an abandonment under sections 4905.20
and 4905.21 of the Revised Code, the commission shall not approve that part of the transition plan
unless it makes the finding required for approval of an abandonment application under section
Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
68

Section 85:
4905.21 of the Revised Code. Sections 4905.20 and 4905.21 of the Revised Code otherwise shall not
apply to a transition plan under sections 4928.31 to 4928.40 of the Revised Code.
Sec. 4928.542. The winning bid or bids selected through the competitive procurement
process established under section 4928.54 of the Revised Code shall meet all of the following
requirements:
(A) Be designed to provide reliable competitive retail electric service to percentage of
income payment plan program customers;
(B) Reduce the cost of the percentage of income payment plan program relative to the
otherwise applicable standard service offer established under sections 4928.141, and 4928.142, and

Section 86:
4928.143 of the Revised Code;
(C) Result in the best value for persons paying the universal service rider under section

Section 87:
4928.52 of the Revised Code.
Sec. 4928.64. (A)(1) As used in this section, "qualifying renewable energy resource" means
a renewable energy resource, as defined in section 4928.01 of the Revised Code that:
(a) Has a placed-in-service date on or after January 1, 1998;
(b) Is any run-of-the-river hydroelectric facility that has an in-service date on or after
January 1, 1980;
(c) Is a small hydroelectric facility;
(d) Is created on or after January 1, 1998, by the modification or retrofit of any facility
placed in service prior to January 1, 1998; or
(e) Is a mercantile customer-sited renewable energy resource, whether new or existing, that
the mercantile customer commits for integration into the electric distribution utility's demand-
response, energy efficiency, or peak demand reduction programs as provided under division (A)(2)
(c) of section 4928.66 of the Revised Code, including, but not limited to, any of the following:
(i) A resource that has the effect of improving the relationship between real and reactive
power;
(ii) A resource that makes efficient use of waste heat or other thermal capabilities owned or
controlled by a mercantile customer;
(iii) Storage technology that allows a mercantile customer more flexibility to modify its
demand or load and usage characteristics;
(iv) Electric generation equipment owned or controlled by a mercantile customer that uses a
renewable energy resource.
(2) For the purpose of this section and as it considers appropriate, the public utilities
commission may classify any new technology as such a qualifying renewable energy resource.
(B)(1) By the end of 2026, an electric distribution utility shall have provided from qualifying
renewable energy resources, including, at its discretion, qualifying renewable energy resources
obtained pursuant to an electricity supply contract, a portion of the electricity supply required for its
standard service offer under section sections 4928.141 and 4928.142 of the Revised Code, and an
Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
69
electric services company shall have provided a portion of its electricity supply for retail consumers
in this state from qualifying renewable energy resources, including, at its discretion, qualifying
renewable energy resources obtained pursuant to an electricity supply contract. That portion shall
equal eight and one-half per cent of the total number of kilowatt hours of electricity sold by the
subject utility or company to any and all retail electric consumers whose electric load centers are
served by that utility and are located within the utility's certified territory or, in the case of an electric
services company, are served by the company and are located within this state. However, nothing in
this section precludes a utility or company from providing a greater percentage.
(2) Subject to section 4928.642 of the Revised Code, the The portion required under division
(B)(1) of this section shall be generated from renewable energy resources in accordance with the
following benchmarks:

S 2026 8.5% 0%
(3) The qualifying renewable energy resources implemented by the utility or company shall
be met either:
(a) Through facilities located in this state; or
(b) With resources that can be shown to be deliverable into this state.
(C)(1) The commission annually shall review an electric distribution utility's or electric
services company's compliance with the most recent applicable benchmark under division (B)(2) of
this section and, in the course of that review, shall identify any undercompliance or noncompliance
of the utility or company that it determines is weather-related, related to equipment or resource
shortages for qualifying renewable energy resources as applicable, or is otherwise outside the
utility's or company's control.
(2) Subject to the cost cap provisions of division (C)(3) of this section, if the commission
determines, after notice and opportunity for hearing, and based upon its findings in that review
regarding avoidable undercompliance or noncompliance, but subject to division (C)(4) of this

Section 88:
section, that the utility or company has failed to comply with any such benchmark, the commission
shall impose a renewable energy compliance payment on the utility or company.
(a) The compliance payment pertaining to the solar energy resource benchmarks under
division (B)(2) of this section shall be an amount per megawatt hour of undercompliance or
noncompliance in the period under review, as follows:
(i) Three hundred dollars for 2014, 2015, and 2016;
(ii) Two hundred fifty dollars for 2017 and 2018;
(iii) Two hundred dollars for 2019.
(b) The compliance payment pertaining to the renewable energy resource benchmarks under
division (B)(2) of this section shall equal the number of additional renewable energy credits that the
electric distribution utility or electric services company would have needed to comply with the
applicable benchmark in the period under review times an amount that shall begin at forty-five
dollars and shall be adjusted annually by the commission to reflect any change in the consumer price
index as defined in section 101.27 of the Revised Code, but shall not be less than forty-five dollars.
Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
71
As used in this division, "consumer price index" means the consumer price index prepared by the
United States bureau of labor statistics (U.S. city average for urban wage earners and clerical
workers: all items, 1982-1984=100), or, if that index is no longer published, a generally available
comparable index.
(c) The compliance payment shall not be passed through by the electric distribution utility or
electric services company to consumers. The compliance payment shall be remitted to the
commission, for deposit to the credit of the advanced energy fund created under section 4928.61 of
the Revised Code. Payment of the compliance payment shall be subject to such collection and
enforcement procedures as apply to the collection of a forfeiture under sections 4905.55 to 4905.60
and 4905.64 of the Revised Code.
(3) An electric distribution utility or an electric services company need not comply with a
benchmark under division (B)(2) of this section to the extent that its reasonably expected cost of that
compliance exceeds its reasonably expected cost of otherwise producing or acquiring the requisite
electricity by three per cent or more. The cost of compliance shall be calculated as though any
exemption from taxes and assessments had not been granted under section 5727.75 of the Revised
Code.
(4)(a) An electric distribution utility or electric services company may request the
commission to make a force majeure determination pursuant to this division regarding all or part of
the utility's or company's compliance with any minimum benchmark under division (B)(2) of this

Section 89:
section during the period of review occurring pursuant to division (C)(2) of this section. The
commission may require the electric distribution utility or electric services company to make
solicitations for renewable energy resource credits as part of its default service before the utility's or
company's request of force majeure under this division can be made.
(b) Within ninety days after the filing of a request by an electric distribution utility or
electric services company under division (C)(4)(a) of this section, the commission shall determine if
qualifying renewable energy resources are reasonably available in the marketplace in sufficient
quantities for the utility or company to comply with the subject minimum benchmark during the
review period. In making this determination, the commission shall consider whether the electric
distribution utility or electric services company has made a good faith effort to acquire sufficient
qualifying renewable energy or, as applicable, solar energy resources to so comply, including, but
not limited to, by banking or seeking renewable energy resource credits or by seeking the resources
through long-term contracts. Additionally, the commission shall consider the availability of
qualifying renewable energy or solar energy resources in this state and other jurisdictions in the PJM
interconnection regional transmission organization, L.L.C., or its successor and the midcontinent
independent system operator or its successor.
(c) If, pursuant to division (C)(4)(b) of this section, the commission determines that
qualifying renewable energy or solar energy resources are not reasonably available to permit the
electric distribution utility or electric services company to comply, during the period of review, with
Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
72
the subject minimum benchmark prescribed under division (B)(2) of this section, the commission
shall modify that compliance obligation of the utility or company as it determines appropriate to
accommodate the finding. Commission modification shall not automatically reduce the obligation
for the electric distribution utility's or electric services company's compliance in subsequent years. If
it modifies the electric distribution utility or electric services company obligation under division (C)
(4)(c) of this section, the commission may require the utility or company, if sufficient renewable
energy resource credits exist in the marketplace, to acquire additional renewable energy resource
credits in subsequent years equivalent to the utility's or company's modified obligation under
division (C)(4)(c) of this section.
(5) The commission shall establish a process to provide for at least an annual review of the
renewable energy resource market in this state and in the service territories of the regional
transmission organizations that manage transmission systems located in this state. The commission
shall use the results of this study to identify any needed changes to the amount of the renewable
energy compliance payment specified under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of this section. Specifically,
the commission may increase the amount to ensure that payment of compliance payments is not used
to achieve compliance with this section in lieu of actually acquiring or realizing energy derived from
qualifying renewable energy resources. However, if the commission finds that the amount of the
compliance payment should be otherwise changed, the commission shall present this finding to the
general assembly for legislative enactment.
(D) The commission annually shall submit to the general assembly in accordance with

Section 90:
section 101.68 of the Revised Code a report describing all of the following:
(1) The compliance of electric distribution utilities and electric services companies with
division (B) of this section;
(2) The average annual cost of renewable energy credits purchased by utilities and
companies for the year covered in the report;
(3) Any strategy for utility and company compliance or for encouraging the use of qualifying
renewable energy resources in supplying this state's electricity needs in a manner that considers
available technology, costs, job creation, and economic impacts.
The commission shall begin providing the information described in division (D)(2) of this

Section 91:
section in each report submitted after September 10, 2012. The commission shall allow and consider
public comments on the report prior to its submission to the general assembly. Nothing in the report
shall be binding on any person, including any utility or company for the purpose of its compliance
with any benchmark under division (B) of this section, or the enforcement of that provision under
division (C) of this section.
(E) All costs incurred by an electric distribution utility in complying with the requirements
of this section shall be bypassable by any consumer that has exercised choice of supplier under

Section 92:
section 4928.03 of the Revised Code.
Sec. 4928.645. (A) An electric distribution utility or electric services company may use, for
Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
73
the purpose of complying with the requirements under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of section 4928.64 of
the Revised Code, renewable energy credits any time in the five calendar years following the date of
their purchase or acquisition from any entity, including, but not limited to, the following:
(1) A mercantile customer;
(2) An owner or operator of a hydroelectric generating facility that is located at a dam on a
river, or on any water discharged to a river, that is within or bordering this state or within or
bordering an adjoining state, or that produces power that can be shown to be deliverable into this
state;
(3) A seller of compressed natural gas that has been produced from biologically derived
methane gas, provided that the seller may only provide renewable energy credits for metered
amounts of gas.
(B)(1) The public utilities commission shall adopt rules specifying that one unit of credit
shall equal one megawatt hour of electricity derived from renewable energy resources, except that,
for a generating facility of seventy-five megawatts or greater that is situated within this state and has
committed by December 31, 2009, to modify or retrofit its generating unit or units to enable the
facility to generate principally from biomass energy by June 30, 2013, each megawatt hour of
electricity generated principally from that biomass energy shall equal, in units of credit, the product
obtained by multiplying the actual percentage of biomass feedstock heat input used to generate such
megawatt hour by the quotient obtained by dividing the then existing unit dollar amount used to
determine a renewable energy compliance payment as provided under division (C)(2)(b) of section

Section 93:
4928.64 of the Revised Code by the then existing market value of one renewable energy credit, but
such megawatt hour shall not equal less than one unit of credit. Renewable energy resources do not
have to be converted to electricity in order to be eligible to receive renewable energy credits. The

investigation and valuation, the form in which the results of the ascertainment of the value of each
public utility or railroad shall be submitted, and the classifications of the elements that constitute the
ascertained value. Such investigation shall also show the value of the property of every public utility
or railroad as a whole, and if such property is in more than one county, the value of its property in
each of such counties.
"Valuation" and "value," as used in this section, may include, with :
(A) With respect to a public utility that is a natural gas, water-works, or sewage disposal
system company, projected valuation and value as of the date certain, if applicable because of a
future date certain under section 4909.15 of the Revised Code;
(B) With respect to an electric light company that chooses to file a forecasted test period
under section 4909.18 of the Revised Code, the valuation and value during the forecasted test period.
Sec. 4909.07. The public utilities commission, during the making of the valuation provided
for in sections 4909.04 to 4909.13 of the Revised Code, and after its completion, shall in like
manner keep itself informed through its engineers, experts, and other assistants of all extensions,
improvements, or other changes in the condition and value of the property of all public utilities or
railroads and shall ascertain the value of such extensions, improvements, and changes. The
commission shall, as is required for the proper regulation of such public utilities or railroads, revise
and correct its valuations of property, showing such revisions and corrections as a whole and as to

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.

Sec. 4909.08. When the public utilities commission has completed the valuation of the
property of any public utility or railroad and before such valuation becomes final, it shall give notice
by registered letter to such public utility or railroad, and if a substantial portion of said public utility
or railroad is situated in a municipal corporation, then to the mayor of such municipal corporation,
stating the valuations placed upon the several kinds and classes of property of such public utility or
railroad and upon the property as a whole and give such further notice by publication or otherwise as
it shall deem necessary to apprise the public of such valuation. If, within thirty days after such
notification, no protest has been filed with the commission, such valuation becomes final. If notice
of protest has been filed by any public utility or railroad, the commission shall fix a time for hearing
such protest and shall consider at such hearing any matter material thereto presented by such public
utility, railroad, or municipal corporation, in support of its protest or by any representative of the
public against such protest. If, after the hearing of any protest of any valuation so fixed, the
commission is of the opinion that its inventory is incomplete or inaccurate or that its valuation is
incorrect, it shall make such changes as are necessary and shall issue an order making such corrected
valuations final. A final valuation by the commission and all classifications made for the
ascertainment of such valuations shall be public and are prima-facie evidence relative to the value of
the property.
"Valuation" and "value," as used in this section, may include, with :
(A) With respect to a public utility that is a natural gas, water-works, or sewage disposal
system company, projected valuation and value as of the date certain, if applicable because of a

Sec. 4909.15. (A) The public utilities commission, when fixing and determining just and
reasonable rates, fares, tolls, rentals, and charges, shall determine:

disposal system company, or that is an electric light company that chooses not to file a forecasted
test period under section 4909.18 of the Revised Code, the valuation as of the date certain of the
property of the public utility that is used and useful or, with respect to a natural gas, water-works, or
sewage disposal system company, is projected to be used and useful as of the date certain, in
rendering the public utility service for which rates are to be fixed and determined. The

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
26
(b) With respect to an electric light company that chooses to file a forecasted test period
under section 4909.18 of the Revised Code, the valuation of the property of the utility that is
projected to be used and useful during the forecasted test period in rendering the public utility
service for which rates are to be fixed and determined.
(c) The valuation so determined under division (A)(1) of this section for any public utility
shall be the total value as set forth in division (C)(9)(B)(8) of section 4909.042 of the Revised Code
and division (B)(9) of section 4909.05 of the Revised Code, and a reasonable allowance for
materials and supplies and a reasonable allowance for cash working capital as determined by the
commission.
The commission, in its discretion, may include in the valuation a reasonable allowance for
construction work in progress but, in no event, may such an allowance be made by the commission
until it has determined that the particular construction project is at least seventy-five per cent
complete.
In determining the percentage completion of a particular construction project, the
commission shall consider, among other relevant criteria, the per cent of time elapsed in
construction; the per cent of construction funds, excluding allowance for funds used during
construction, expended, or obligated to such construction funds budgeted where all such funds are
adjusted to reflect current purchasing power; and any physical inspection performed by or on behalf
of any party, including the commission's staff.
A reasonable allowance for construction work in progress shall not exceed ten per cent of the
total valuation as stated in this division, not including such allowance for construction work in
progress.
Where the commission permits an allowance for construction work in progress, the dollar
value of the project or portion thereof included in the valuation as construction work in progress
shall not be included in the valuation as plant in service until such time as the total revenue effect of
the construction work in progress allowance is offset by the total revenue effect of the plant in
service exclusion. Carrying charges calculated in a manner similar to allowance for funds used
during construction shall accrue on that portion of the project in service but not reflected in rates as
plant in service, and such accrued carrying charges shall be included in the valuation of the property
at the conclusion of the offset period for purposes of division (C)(9) of section 4909.05 of the
Revised Code.
From and after April 10, 1985, no allowance for construction work in progress as it relates to
a particular construction project shall be reflected in rates for a period exceeding forty-eight
consecutive months commencing on the date the initial rates reflecting such allowance become
effective, except as otherwise provided in this division.
The applicable maximum period in rates for an allowance for construction work in progress
as it relates to a particular construction project shall be tolled if, and to the extent, a delay in the in-
service date of the project is caused by the action or inaction of any federal, state, county, or

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
27
municipal agency having jurisdiction, where such action or inaction relates to a change in a rule,
standard, or approval of such agency, and where such action or inaction is not the result of the
failure of the utility to reasonably endeavor to comply with any rule, standard, or approval prior to
such change.
In the event that such period expires before the project goes into service, the commission
shall exclude, from the date of expiration, the allowance for the project as construction work in
progress from rates, except that the commission may extend the expiration date up to twelve months
for good cause shown.
In the event that a utility has permanently canceled, abandoned, or terminated construction
of a project for which it was previously permitted a construction work in progress allowance, the
commission immediately shall exclude the allowance for the project from the valuation.
In the event that a construction work in progress project previously included in the valuation
is removed from the valuation pursuant to this division, any revenues collected by the utility from its
customers after April 10, 1985, that resulted from such prior inclusion shall be offset against future
revenues over the same period of time as the project was included in the valuation as construction
work in progress. The total revenue effect of such offset shall not exceed the total revenues
previously collected.
In no event shall the total revenue effect of any offset or offsets provided under division (A)
(1) of this section exceed the total revenue effect of any construction work in progress allowance.
(2) A fair and reasonable rate of return to the utility on the valuation as determined in
division (A)(1) of this section;
(3) The dollar annual return to which the utility is entitled by applying the fair and
reasonable rate of return as determined under division (A)(2) of this section to the valuation of the
utility determined under division (A)(1) of this section;
(4) The cost to the utility of rendering the public utility service for the test period used for
the determination under division (C)(1) of this section, less the total of any interest on cash or credit
refunds paid, pursuant to section 4909.42 of the Revised Code, by the utility during the test period.
(a) Federal, state, and local taxes imposed on or measured by net income may, in the
discretion of the commission, be computed by the normalization method of accounting, provided the
utility maintains accounting reserves that reflect differences between taxes actually payable and
taxes on a normalized basis, provided that no determination as to the treatment in the rate-making
process of such taxes shall be made that will result in loss of any tax depreciation or other tax benefit
to which the utility would otherwise be entitled, and further provided that such tax benefit as
redounds to the utility as a result of such a computation may not be retained by the company, used to
fund any dividend or distribution, or utilized for any purpose other than the defrayal of the operating
expenses of the utility and the defrayal of the expenses of the utility in connection with construction
work.
(b) The amount of any tax credits granted to an electric light company under section

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
28
5727.391 of the Revised Code for Ohio coal burned prior to January 1, 2000, shall not be retained by
the company, used to fund any dividend or distribution, or utilized for any purposes other than the
defrayal of the allowable operating expenses of the company and the defrayal of the allowable
expenses of the company in connection with the installation, acquisition, construction, or use of a
compliance facility. The amount of the tax credits granted to an electric light company under that
section for Ohio coal burned prior to January 1, 2000, shall be returned to its customers within three
years after initially claiming the credit through an offset to the company's rates or fuel component, as
determined by the commission, as set forth in schedules filed by the company under section 4905.30
of the Revised Code. As used in division (A)(4)(b) of this section, "compliance facility" has the
same meaning as in section 5727.391 of the Revised Code.
(B) The commission shall compute the gross annual revenues to which the utility is entitled
by adding the dollar amount of return under division (A)(3) of this section to the cost, for the test
period used for the determination under division (C)(1) of this section, of rendering the public utility
service under division (A)(4) of this section.
(C)(1) Except as provided in division (D) of this section, the revenues and expenses of the
utility shall be determined during a test period. The utility may as follows:
(a) Electric light companies may propose a forecasted test period. If the company proposes a
forecasted test period, the company shall propose annual base rates for three consecutive twelve-
month periods in a single forecasted test period application.
During the first twelve-month period, the company shall propose a reasonably forecasted
rate base using a thirteen-month average, revenues, and expenses for the first twelve months that
new base rates will be in effect.
During the second twelve-month period, the base rate revenue requirement shall be adjusted
for the return of, and return on, incremental rate base additions approved by the commission in the
initial application. During the third twelve-month period, the base rate revenue requirement shall be
adjusted for the return of and return on incremental rate base additions approved by the commission
in the initial application.
For each twelve-month period, forecasted plant investment, forecasted revenues, and
forecasted expenses versus actual investment, actual revenues, and actual expenses shall be trued up
via a cost recovery mechanism approved by the commission.
Each true-up process shall include an adjustment to actual for the rate of return that the
company is authorized to earn on the actual investments made. The company shall provide the
commission with actual financial information during the true-up process to ensure accuracy. As part
of the true-up process, the commission shall include only rate base components that have been found
by the commission to be used and useful in rendering public utility service.
At the end of the last test period, the company shall file for a rate case under section 4909.18
of the Revised Code.
(b) All utilities, except for electric light companies that choose to file under division (C)(1)

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
29
(a) of this section, shall propose a test period for this determination that is any twelve-month period
beginning not more than six months prior to the date the application is filed and ending not more
than nine months subsequent to that date. The test period for determining revenues and expenses of
the utility shall be the test period proposed by the utility, unless otherwise ordered by the
commission.
(2) The For utilities filing under division (C)(1)(b) of this section, the date certain shall be
not later than the date of filing, except that it shall be, for a natural gas, water-works, or sewage
disposal system company, not later than the end of the test period.
(D) A natural gas, water-works, or sewage disposal system company Utilities filing under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section may propose adjustments to the revenues and expenses to be
determined under division (C)(1) of this section for any changes that are, during the test period or
the twelve-month period immediately following the test period, reasonably expected to occur. The
natural gas, water-works, or sewage disposal system company utility shall identify and quantify,
individually, any proposed adjustments. The commission shall incorporate the proposed adjustments
into the determination if the adjustments are just and reasonable.
(E) When the commission is of the opinion, after hearing and after making the
determinations under divisions (A) and (B) of this section, that any rate, fare, charge, toll, rental,
schedule, classification, or service, or any joint rate, fare, charge, toll, rental, schedule, classification,
or service rendered, charged, demanded, exacted, or proposed to be rendered, charged, demanded, or
exacted, is, or will be, unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory, unjustly preferential, or in
violation of law, that the service is, or will be, inadequate, or that the maximum rates, charges, tolls,
or rentals chargeable by any such public utility are insufficient to yield reasonable compensation for
the service rendered, and are unjust and unreasonable, the commission shall:
(1) With due regard among other things to the value of all property of the public utility
actually used and useful for the convenience of the public as determined under division (A)(1) of
this section, excluding from such value the value of any franchise or right to own, operate, or enjoy
the same in excess of the amount, exclusive of any tax or annual charge, actually paid to any
political subdivision of the state or county, as the consideration for the grant of such franchise or
right, and excluding any value added to such property by reason of a monopoly or merger, with due
regard in determining the dollar annual return under division (A)(3) of this section to the necessity of
making reservation out of the income for surplus, depreciation, and contingencies, and;
(2) With due regard to all such other matters as are proper, according to the facts in each
case,
(a) Including a fair and reasonable rate of return determined by the commission with
reference to a cost of debt equal to the actual embedded cost of debt of such public utility,
(b) But not including the portion of any periodic rental or use payments representing that
cost of property that is included in the valuation report under divisions (C)(4)(B)(4) and (5) of
section 4909.042 of the Revised Code and divisions (B)(4) and (5) of section 4909.05 of the Revised

Code, fix and determine the just and reasonable rate, fare, charge, toll, rental, or service to be
rendered, charged, demanded, exacted, or collected for the performance or rendition of the service
that will provide the public utility the allowable gross annual revenues under division (B) of this
section, and order such just and reasonable rate, fare, charge, toll, rental, or service to be substituted
for the existing one. After such determination and order no change in the rate, fare, toll, charge,
rental, schedule, classification, or service shall be made, rendered, charged, demanded, exacted, or
changed by such public utility without the order of the commission, and any other rate, fare, toll,
charge, rental, classification, or service is prohibited.

with respect to a competitive retail electric service shall be such authority as is provided for their
enforcement under Chapters 4901. to 4909., 4933., 4935., and 4963. of the Revised Code and this
chapter. Nothing in this division shall be construed to limit the commission's authority under
sections 4928.141 to , 4928.142, and 4928.144 of the Revised Code.
On and after the starting date of competitive retail electric service, a (2) A competitive retail
electric service supplied by an electric cooperative shall not be subject to supervision and regulation
by the commission under Chapters 4901. to 4909., 4933., 4935., and 4963. of the Revised Code,
except as otherwise expressly provided in sections 4928.01 to 4928.10 and 4928.16 of the Revised
Code.
(2) On and after the starting date of competitive retail electric service, a (B)(1) A
noncompetitive retail electric service supplied by an electric utility shall be subject to supervision
and regulation by the commission under Chapters 4901. to 4909., 4933., 4935., and 4963. of the
Revised Code and this chapter, to the extent that authority is not preempted by federal law. The
commission's authority to enforce those provisions with respect to a noncompetitive retail electric

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
46
service shall be the authority provided under those chapters and this chapter, to the extent the
authority is not preempted by federal law. Notwithstanding Chapters 4905. and 4909. of the Revised
Code, commission authority under this chapter shall include the authority to provide for the
recovery, through a reconcilable rider on an electric distribution utility's distribution rates, of all
transmission and transmission-related costs, including ancillary and congestion costs, imposed on or
charged to the utility by the federal energy regulatory commission or a regional transmission
organization, independent transmission operator, or similar organization approved by the federal
energy regulatory commission.
The commission shall adopt, for each electric distribution utility that provides customers
with a standard service offer in compliance with sections 4928.141 and 4928.142 of the Revised
Code, a nonbypassable cost recovery mechanism relating to transmission, ancillary, congestion, or
any related service required for such standard service offer that includes provisions for the recovery
of any cost of such service that the electric distribution utility incurs pursuant to the standard service
offer.
(2) The commission shall exercise its jurisdiction with respect to the delivery of electricity
by an electric utility in this state on or after the starting date of competitive retail electric service so
as to ensure that no aspect of the delivery of electricity by the utility to consumers in this state that
consists of a noncompetitive retail electric service is unregulated.
On and after that starting date, a (3) A noncompetitive retail electric service supplied by an
electric cooperative shall not be subject to supervision and regulation by the commission under
Chapters 4901. to 4909., 4933., 4935., and 4963. of the Revised Code, except sections 4933.81 to
4933.90 and 4935.03 of the Revised Code. The commission's authority to enforce those excepted
sections with respect to a noncompetitive retail electric service of an electric cooperative shall be
such authority as is provided for their enforcement under Chapters 4933. and 4935. of the Revised
Code.
(B) Nothing in this chapter affects the authority of the commission under Title XLIX of the
Revised Code to regulate an electric light company in this state or an electric service supplied in this
state prior to the starting date of competitive retail electric service.
Sec. 4928.08. (A) This section applies to an electric cooperative, or to a governmental
aggregator that is a municipal electric utility, only to the extent of a competitive retail electric
service it provides to a customer to whom it does not provide a noncompetitive retail electric service
through transmission or distribution facilities it singly or jointly owns or operates.
(B) (B)(1) No electric utility, electric services company, electric cooperative, or
governmental aggregator shall provide a competitive retail electric service to a consumer in this state
on and after the starting date of competitive retail electric service without first being certified by the
public utilities commission regarding its managerial, technical, and financial capability to provide
that service and providing a financial guarantee sufficient to protect customers and electric
distribution utilities from default. Certification shall be granted pursuant to procedures and standards

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
47
the commission shall prescribe in accordance with division (C) of this section, except that
certification or certification renewal shall be deemed approved thirty days after the filing of an
application with the commission unless the commission suspends that approval for good cause
shown. In the case of such a suspension, the commission shall act to approve or deny certification or
certification renewal to the applicant not later than ninety days after the date of the suspension.
(2) The public utilities commission shall establish rules to require an electric services
company to maintain financial assurances sufficient to protect customers and electric distribution
utilities from default. Such rules also shall specifically allow an electric distribution utility to set
reasonable standards for its security and the security of its customers through financial requirements
set in its tariffs.
(3) As used in division (B)(2) of this section, an "electric services company" has the same
meaning as in section 4928.01 of the Revised Code, but excludes a power broker or aggregator.
(C) Capability standards adopted in rules under division (B) of this section shall be sufficient
to ensure compliance with the minimum service requirements established under section 4928.10 of
the Revised Code and with section 4928.09 of the Revised Code. The standards shall allow
flexibility for voluntary aggregation, to encourage market creativity in responding to consumer
needs and demands, and shall allow flexibility for electric services companies that exclusively
provide installation of small electric generation facilities, to provide ease of market access. The rules
shall include procedures for biennially renewing certification.
(D) The commission may suspend, rescind, or conditionally rescind the certification of any
electric utility, electric services company, electric cooperative, or governmental aggregator issued
under this section if the commission determines, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing,
that the utility, company, cooperative, or aggregator has failed to comply with any applicable
certification standards or has engaged in anticompetitive or unfair, deceptive, or unconscionable acts
or practices in this state.
(E) No electric distribution utility on and after the starting date of competitive retail electric
service shall knowingly distribute electricity, to a retail consumer in this state, for any supplier of
electricity that has not been certified by the commission pursuant to this section.
(F) Notwithstanding any provision of section 121.95 of the Revised Code to the contrary, a
regulatory restriction contained in a rule adopted under section 4928.08 of the Revised Code is not
subject to sections 121.95 to 121.953 of the Revised Code.
Sec. 4928.101. (A) As used in this section and section 4928.102 of the Revised Code:
(1) "Small commercial customer" means any customer that receives electric service pursuant
to a nonresidential tariff if the customer's demand for electricity does not exceed twenty-five

meters.
(B) The consumer protections described in section 4928.10 of the Revised Code and the
rules adopted pursuant to that section apply to small commercial customers and to all other
customers as set forth in the rules.
Sec. 4928.102. (A) If a competitive retail electric service supplier offers a residential or
small commercial customer a contract for a fixed introductory rate that converts to a variable rate
upon the expiration of the fixed rate, the supplier shall send two notices to each residential and small
commercial customer that enters into such a contract. Each notice shall provide all of the following
information to the customer:
(1) The fixed rate that is expiring under the contract;
(2) The expiration date of the contract's fixed rate;
(3) The public utilities commission web site that, as a comparison tool, lists rates offered by
competitive retail electric service suppliers;
(4) A statement explaining that appearing on each customer's bill is a price-to-compare
notice that lists the utility's standard service offer price.

section and shall also identify the initial rate to be charged upon the contract's conversion to a
variable rate.
(C) The notices shall be sent by standard United States mail or electronically with a
customer's verifiable consent as follows:
(1) The supplier shall send the first notice not earlier than ninety days, and not later than
sixty days, prior to the expiration of the fixed rate.
(2) The supplier shall send the second notice not earlier than forty-five days, and not later
than fifteen days, prior to the expiration of the fixed rate.
(D) A competitive retail electric service supplier shall provide an annual notice, by standard
United States mail or electronically with a customer's verifiable consent, to each residential and
small commercial customer that has entered into a contract with the supplier that has converted to a
variable rate upon the expiration of the contract's fixed introductory rate. The notice shall inform the
customer that the customer is currently subject to a variable rate and that other fixed rate contracts
are available.
(E) Not later than one hundred fifty days after the effective date of this section, the
commission shall adopt rules in order to implement divisions (A) to (D) of this section. The rules, at
a minimum, shall include the following requirements regarding the notices required under divisions
(A) to (D) of this section:
(1) To use clear and unambiguous language in order to enable the customer to make an
informed decision;

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
49
(2) To design the notices in a way to ensure that they cannot be confused with marketing
materials.
(F) Notwithstanding any provision of section 121.95 of the Revised Code to the contrary, a
regulatory restriction contained in a rule adopted under section 4928.101 of the Revised Code is not
subject to sections 121.95 to 121.953 of the Revised Code.
Sec. 4928.103. (A) As used in this section, "customer account information" means a unique
electric distribution utility number or other customer identification number used by the utility to
identify a customer and the customer's account record.
(B) The public utilities commission shall adopt rules to ensure that an electric distribution
utility processes a customer's change in competitive retail electric supplier by using customer
account information. A customer who consents to a change of supplier shall not be required to
provide customer account information to the supplier if the customer provides a valid form of
government-issued identification issued to the customer or a sufficient alternative form of
identification that allows the supplier to establish the customer's identity accurately.
(C) Notwithstanding any provision of section 121.95 of the Revised Code to the contrary, a
regulatory restriction contained in a rule adopted under this section is not subject to sections 121.95
to 121.953 of the Revised Code.
Sec. 4928.104. (A) A competitive retail electric service supplier may offer alternative billing
and payment structures as agreed upon in a service contract with a mercantile customer, without
restriction to specific models, provided the supplier complies with applicable laws and regulations.
The alternative billing and payment structure may include any of the following:
(1) Daily, weekly, or milestone-based payments;
(2) Online-only billing and payment requirements;
(3) Prepayment-based service structures.

supplier from requiring electronic payment methods as a condition of service under a non-traditional
billing agreement.
Sec. 4928.105. (A) Upon receiving a certified request from a competitive retail electric
service supplier under a service agreement that explicitly authorizes an expedited return to an
electric distribution utility's standard service offer, voluntarily entered into by a mercantile customer,
a utility shall complete the request within three business days.
(B) The electric distribution utility shall not be held liable for any disputes arising from the
expedited return to the utility's standard service offer, provided the utility acts in accordance with the
public utilities commission's rules.
(C) The commission shall establish rules governing the process for an expedited return to the
utility's standard service offer pursuant to this section, including the content of the certified request
and any notice to the affected customer, and permitting electric distribution utilities to recover the
administrative costs of processing requests under this section through reasonable fees assessed to

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
50
competitive retail electric service suppliers.
Sec. 4928.14. The (A) Except as provided in division (C) of this section, the failure of a
supplier to provide retail electric generation service to customers within the certified territory of an
electric distribution utility shall result in the supplier's customers, after reasonable notice, defaulting
to the utility's standard service offer under sections 4928.141, and 4928.142, and 4928.143 of the
Revised Code until the customer chooses an alternative supplier. A
(B) A supplier is deemed under this section to have failed to provide such retail electric
generation service if the commission finds, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing, that
any of the following conditions are met:
(A) (1) The supplier has defaulted on its contracts with customers, is in receivership, or has
filed for bankruptcy.
(B) (2) The supplier is no longer capable of providing the service.
(C) (3) The supplier is unable to provide delivery to transmission or distribution facilities for
such period of time as may be reasonably specified by commission rule adopted under division (A)
of section 4928.06 of the Revised Code.
(D) (4) The supplier's certification has been suspended, conditionally rescinded, or rescinded
under division (D) of section 4928.08 of the Revised Code.
(C) If an electric distribution utility has an electric security plan that was approved under
section 4928.143 of the Revised Code as that section existed prior to the amendments to this section
by this act, the failure of a supplier to provide retail electric generation service to customers within
the certified territory of that utility shall result in the supplier's customers, after reasonable notice,
defaulting to the utility's standard service offer under that electric security plan until the customer
chooses an alternative supplier or until the utility's standard service offer is authorized under section
4928.142 of the Revised Code.
Sec. 4928.141. (A) Beginning January 1, 2009, an (A)(1) An electric distribution utility shall
provide consumers, on a comparable and nondiscriminatory basis within its certified territory, a
standard service offer of all competitive retail electric services necessary to maintain essential
electric service to consumers, including a firm supply of electric generation service. To that end, the
electric distribution utility shall apply to the public utilities commission to establish the standard
service offer in accordance with section 4928.142 or 4928.143 of the Revised Code and, at its
discretion, may apply simultaneously under both sections, except that the utility's first standard
service offer application at minimum shall include a filing under section 4928.143 of the Revised
Code. Only Except as provided in division (A)(2) of this section, a standard service offer authorized
in accordance with section 4928.142 or 4928.143 of the Revised Code, shall serve as the utility's
standard service offer for the purpose of compliance with this section;, and that standard service
offer shall serve as the utility's default standard service offer for the purpose of section 4928.14 of
the Revised Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, the rate
(2) An electric distribution utility's electric security plan of an electric distribution utility that

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
51
was approved under section 4928.143 of the Revised Code as that section existed prior to the
amendments to this section by this act shall continue for the purpose of the utility's compliance with
this division (A)(1) of this section until a standard service offer is first authorized to be effective
under section 4928.142 or 4928.143 of the Revised Code, and, as applicable, pursuant to division
(D) of section 4928.143 of the Revised Code, any rate . Each security plan that extends approved
before the effective date of the amendments to this section by this act shall extend beyond December
31, 2008, shall continue to be in effect for the subject electric distribution utility for the duration of
the plan's termthrough the final standard service offer auction delivery period approved by the public
utilities commission under the plan as of the effective date of the amendments to this section by this
act and thereafter shall terminate.
(3) A standard service offer under section 4928.142 or 4928.143 of the Revised Code shall
exclude any previously authorized allowances for transition costs, with such exclusion being
effective on and after the date that the allowance is scheduled to end under the utility's rate electric
security plan.
(B) The commission shall set the time for hearing of a filing under section 4928.142 or
4928.143 of the Revised Code, send written notice of the hearing to the electric distribution utility,
and publish notice in a newspaper of general circulation in each county in the utility's certified
territory. The commission shall adopt rules regarding filings under those sections the section.
Sec. 4928.142. (A) For the purpose of complying with section 4928.141 of the Revised Code
and subject to division (D) of this section and, as applicable, subject to the rate plan requirement
requirements of division (A) of section 4928.141 of the Revised Code, an electric distribution utility
may shall establish a standard service offer price for retail electric generation service that is
delivered to the utility under a market-rate offer.
(1) The market-rate offer shall be determined through a competitive bidding process that
provides for all of the following:
(a) Open, fair, and transparent competitive solicitation;
(b) Clear product definition;
(c) Standardized bid evaluation criteria;
(d) Oversight by an independent third party that shall design the solicitation, administer the
bidding, and ensure that the criteria specified in division divisions (A)(1)(a) to (c) of this section are
met;
(e) Evaluation of the submitted bids prior to the selection of the least-cost bid winner or
winners.
No generation supplier shall be prohibited from participating in the bidding process.
(2) The public utilities commission shall modify rules, or adopt new rules as necessary,
concerning the conduct of the competitive bidding process and the qualifications of bidders, which
rules shall foster supplier participation in the bidding process and shall be consistent with the
requirements of division (A)(1) of this section.

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
52
(B) Prior to initiating a competitive bidding process for a market-rate offer under division
(A) of this section, the electric distribution utility shall file an application with the commission. An
electric distribution utility may file its application with the commission prior to the effective date of
the commission rules required under division (A)(2) of this section, and, as the commission
determines necessary, the utility shall immediately conform its filing to the rules upon their taking
effect.
An application under this division shall detail the electric distribution utility's proposed
compliance with the requirements of division (A)(1) of this section and with commission rules under
division (A)(2) of this section and demonstrate that all of the following requirements are met:
(1) The electric distribution utility or its transmission service affiliate belongs to at least one
regional transmission organization that has been approved by the federal energy regulatory
commission; or there otherwise is comparable and nondiscriminatory access to the electric
transmission grid.
(2) Any such regional transmission organization has a market-monitor function and the
ability to take actions to identify and mitigate market power or the electric distribution utility's
market conduct; or a similar market monitoring function exists with commensurate ability to identify
and monitor market conditions and mitigate conduct associated with the exercise of market power.
(3) A published source of information is available publicly or through subscription that
identifies pricing information for traded electricity on- and off-peak energy products that are
contracts for delivery beginning at least two years from the date of the publication and is updated on
a regular basis.
The commission shall initiate a proceeding and, within ninety days after the application's
filing date, shall determine by order whether the electric distribution utility and its market-rate offer
meet all of the foregoing requirements. If the finding is positive, the electric distribution utility may
shall initiate its competitive bidding process. If the finding is negative as to one or more
requirements, the commission in the order shall direct the electric distribution utility regarding how
any deficiency may shall be timely remedied in a timely manner to the commission's satisfaction;
otherwise, the electric distribution utility shall withdraw the application. However, if such remedy is
made and the subsequent finding is positive and also if the electric distribution utility made a
simultaneous filing under this section and section 4928.143 of the Revised Code, the utility shall not
initiate its competitive bid until at least one hundred fifty days after the filing date of those
applications.
(C) Upon the completion of the competitive bidding process authorized by divisions (A) and
(B) of this section, including for the purpose of division (D) of this section, the commission shall
select the least-cost bid winner or winners of that process, and such selected bid or bids, as
prescribed as retail rates by the commission, shall be the electric distribution utility's standard
service offer unless the commission, by order issued before the third calendar day following the
conclusion of the competitive bidding process for the market rate offer, determines that one or more

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
53
of the following criteria were not met:
(1) Each portion of the bidding process was oversubscribed, such that the amount of supply
bid upon was greater than the amount of the load bid out.
(2) There were four or more bidders.
(3) At least twenty-five per cent of the load is bid upon by one or more persons other than
the electric distribution utility.
All costs incurred by the electric distribution utility as a result of or related to the
competitive bidding process or to procuring generation service to provide the standard service offer,
including the costs of energy and capacity and the costs of all other products and services procured
as a result of the competitive bidding process, shall be timely recovered through the standard service
offer price, and, for that purpose, the commission shall approve a reconciliation mechanism, other
recovery mechanism, or a combination of such mechanisms for the utility.
(D) The first application filed under this section by an electric distribution utility that, as of
July 31, 2008, directly owns, in whole or in part, operating electric generating facilities that had been
used and useful in this state shall require that a portion of that the utility's standard service offer load
for the first five years of the market rate offer be competitively bid under division (A) of this section
as follows: ten per cent of the load in year one, not more than twenty per cent in year two, thirty per
cent in year three, forty per cent in year four, and fifty per cent in year five. Consistent with those
percentages, the commission shall determine the actual percentages for each year of years one
through five. The standard service offer price for retail electric generation service under this first
application shall be a proportionate blend of the bid price and the generation service price for the
remaining standard service offer load, which latter price shall be equal to the electric distribution
utility's most recent standard service offer price, adjusted upward or downward as the commission
determines reasonable, relative to the jurisdictional portion of any known and measurable changes
from the level of any one or more of the following costs as reflected in that most recent standard
service offer price:
(1) The electric distribution utility's prudently incurred cost of fuel used to produce
electricity;
(2) Its prudently incurred purchased power costs;
(3) Its prudently incurred costs of satisfying the supply and demand portfolio requirements
of this state, including, but not limited to, renewable energy resource and energy efficiency
requirements;
(4) Its costs prudently incurred to comply with environmental laws and regulations, with
consideration of the derating of any facility associated with those costs.
In making any adjustment to the most recent standard service offer price on the basis of costs
described in division (D) of this section, the commission shall include the benefits that may become
available to the electric distribution utility as a result of or in connection with the costs included in
the adjustment, including, but not limited to, the utility's receipt of emissions credits or its receipt of

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
54
tax benefits or of other benefits, and, accordingly, the commission may impose such conditions on
the adjustment to ensure that any such benefits are properly aligned with the associated cost
responsibility. The commission shall also determine how such adjustments will affect the electric
distribution utility's return on common equity that may be achieved by those adjustments. The
commission shall not apply its consideration of the return on common equity to reduce any
adjustments authorized under this division unless the adjustments will cause the electric distribution
utility to earn a return on common equity that is significantly in excess of the return on common
equity that is earned by publicly traded companies, including utilities, that face comparable business
and financial risk, with such adjustments for capital structure as may be appropriate. The burden of
proof for demonstrating that significantly excessive earnings will not occur shall be on the electric
distribution utility.
Additionally, the commission may adjust the electric distribution utility's most recent
standard service offer price by such just and reasonable amount that the commission determines
necessary to address any emergency that threatens the utility's financial integrity or to ensure that the
resulting revenue available to the utility for providing the standard service offer is not so inadequate
as to result, directly or indirectly, in a taking of property without compensation pursuant to Section
19 of Article I, Ohio Constitution. The electric distribution utility has the burden of demonstrating
that any adjustment to its most recent standard service offer price is proper in accordance with this
division.
(E) Beginning in the second year of a blended price under division (D) of this section and
notwithstanding any other requirement of this section, the commission may alter prospectively the
proportions specified in that division to mitigate any effect of an abrupt or significant change in the
electric distribution utility's standard service offer price that would otherwise result in general or
with respect to any rate group or rate schedule but for such alteration. Any such alteration shall be
made not more often than annually, and the commission shall not, by altering those proportions and
in any event, including because of the length of time, as authorized under division (C) of this
section, taken to approve the market rate offer, cause the duration of the blending period to exceed
ten years as counted from the effective date of the approved market rate offer. Additionally, any
such alteration shall be limited to an alteration affecting the prospective proportions used during the
blending period and shall not affect any blending proportion previously approved and applied by the
commission under this division.
(F) An electric distribution utility that has received commission approval of its first
application under division (C) of this section shall not, nor ever shall be authorized or required by
the commission to, file an application under section 4928.143 of the Revised Code.
Sec. 4928.144. The public utilities commission by order may authorize any just and
reasonable phase-in of any electric distribution utility rate or price established under sections
4928.141 to 4928.143 and 4928.142 of the Revised Code, and inclusive of carrying charges, as the
commission considers necessary to ensure rate or price stability for consumers. If the commission's

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
55
order includes such a phase-in, the order also shall provide for the creation of regulatory assets
pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, by authorizing the deferral of incurred costs
equal to the amount not collected, plus carrying charges on that amount. Further, the order shall
authorize the collection of those deferrals through a nonbypassable surcharge on any such rate or
price so established for the electric distribution utility by the commission.
Sec. 4928.149. No electric distribution utility may use any electric energy storage system to
participate in the wholesale market, if the utility purchased or acquired that system for distribution
service.
Sec. 4928.1410. If an electric distribution utility has an existing electric security plan under
which the commission had authorized the creation or continuation of riders, then, to the extent those
riders will cease to exist after termination of the electric security plan, the electric distribution utility
is authorized to create necessary regulatory assets or liabilities, along with carrying costs at the
utility's weighted average cost of debt, for the resolution of any outstanding under-collection or
over-collection of funds under such riders. The resolution of such regulatory assets or liabilities shall
be addressed in the first distribution rate case under section 4909.18 of the Revised Code that occurs
after the plan's expiration.
Sec. 4928.17. (A) Except as otherwise provided in sections 4928.141 or 4928.142 or
4928.143 or 4928.31 to 4928.40 of the Revised Code and beginning on the starting date of
competitive retail electric service, no electric utility shall engage in this state, either directly or
through an affiliate, in the businesses of supplying a noncompetitive retail electric service and
supplying a competitive retail electric service, or in the businesses of supplying a noncompetitive
retail electric service and supplying a product or service other than retail electric service, unless the
utility implements and operates under a corporate separation plan that is approved by the public
utilities commission under this section, is consistent with the policy specified in section 4928.02 of
the Revised Code, and achieves all of the following:
(1) The plan provides, at minimum, for the provision of the competitive retail electric service
or the nonelectric product or service through a fully separated affiliate of the utility, and the plan
includes separate accounting requirements, the code of conduct as ordered by the commission
pursuant to a rule it shall adopt under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the Revised Code, and such
other measures as are necessary to effectuate the policy specified in section 4928.02 of the Revised
Code.
(2) The plan satisfies the public interest in preventing unfair competitive advantage and
preventing the abuse of market power.
(3) The plan is sufficient to ensure that the utility will not extend any undue preference or
advantage to any affiliate, division, or part of its own business engaged in the business of supplying
the competitive retail electric service or nonelectric product or service, including, but not limited to,
utility resources such as trucks, tools, office equipment, office space, supplies, customer and
marketing information, advertising, billing and mailing systems, personnel, and training, without

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
56
compensation based upon fully loaded embedded costs charged to the affiliate; and to ensure that
any such affiliate, division, or part will not receive undue preference or advantage from any affiliate,
division, or part of the business engaged in business of supplying the noncompetitive retail electric
service. No such utility, affiliate, division, or part shall extend such undue preference.
Notwithstanding any other division of this section, a utility's obligation under division (A)(3) of this
section shall be effective January 1, 2000.
(B) The commission may approve, modify and approve, or disapprove a corporate separation
plan filed with the commission under division (A) of this section. As part of the code of conduct
required under division (A)(1) of this section, the commission shall adopt rules pursuant to division
(A) of section 4928.06 of the Revised Code regarding corporate separation and procedures for plan
filing and approval. The rules shall include limitations on affiliate practices solely for the purpose of
maintaining a separation of the affiliate's business from the business of the utility to prevent unfair
competitive advantage abuse of market power by virtue of that relationship. The rules also shall
include an opportunity for any person having a real and substantial interest in the corporate
separation plan to file specific objections to the plan and propose specific responses to issues raised
in the objections, which objections and responses the commission shall address in its final order.
Prior to commission approval of the plan, the commission shall afford a hearing upon those aspects
of the plan that the commission determines reasonably require a hearing. The commission may reject
and require refiling of a substantially inadequate plan under this section.
(C) The commission shall issue an order approving or modifying and approving a corporate
separation plan under this section, to be effective on the date specified in the order, only upon
findings that the plan reasonably complies with the requirements of division (A) of this section and
will provide for ongoing compliance with the policy specified in section 4928.02 of the Revised
Code. However, for good cause shown, the commission may issue an order approving or modifying
and approving a corporate separation plan under this section that does not comply with division (A)
(1) of this section but complies with such functional separation requirements as the commission
authorizes to apply for an interim period prescribed in the order, upon a finding that such alternative
plan will provide for ongoing compliance with the policy specified in section 4928.02 of the Revised
Code.
(D) Any party may seek an amendment to a corporate separation plan approved under this
section, and the commission, pursuant to a request from any party or on its own initiative, may order
as it considers necessary the filing of an amended corporate separation plan to reflect changed
circumstances.
(E) No electric distribution utility shall sell or transfer any generating asset it wholly or
partly owns at any time without obtaining prior commission approval.
Sec. 4928.20. (A) The legislative authority of a municipal corporation may adopt an
ordinance, or the board of township trustees of a township or the board of county commissioners of a
county may adopt a resolution, under which, on or after the starting date of competitive retail electric

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
57
service, it may aggregate in accordance with this section the retail electrical loads located,
respectively, within the municipal corporation, township, or unincorporated area of the county and,
for that purpose, may enter into service agreements to facilitate for those loads the sale and purchase
of electricity. The legislative authority or board also may exercise such authority jointly with any
other such legislative authority or board. For customers that are not mercantile customers, an
ordinance or resolution under this division shall specify whether the aggregation will occur only
with the prior, affirmative consent of each person owning, occupying, controlling, or using an
electric load center proposed to be aggregated or will occur automatically for all such persons
pursuant to the opt-out requirements of division (D) of this section. The aggregation of mercantile
customers shall occur only with the prior, affirmative consent of each such person owning,
occupying, controlling, or using an electric load center proposed to be aggregated. Nothing in this
division, however, authorizes the aggregation of the retail electric loads of an electric load center, as
defined in section 4933.81 of the Revised Code, that is located in the certified territory of a nonprofit
electric supplier under sections 4933.81 to 4933.90 of the Revised Code or an electric load center
served by transmission or distribution facilities of a municipal electric utility.
(B) If an ordinance or resolution adopted under division (A) of this section specifies that
aggregation of customers that are not mercantile customers will occur automatically as described in
that division, the ordinance or resolution shall direct the board of elections to submit the question of
the authority to aggregate to the electors of the respective municipal corporation, township, or
unincorporated area of a county at a special election on the day of the next primary or general
election in the municipal corporation, township, or county. The legislative authority or board shall
certify a copy of the ordinance or resolution to the board of elections not less than ninety days before
the day of the special election. No ordinance or resolution adopted under division (A) of this section
that provides for an election under this division shall take effect unless approved by a majority of the
electors voting upon the ordinance or resolution at the election held pursuant to this division.
(C) Upon the applicable requisite authority under divisions (A) and (B) of this section, the
legislative authority or board shall develop a plan of operation and governance for the aggregation
program so authorized. Before adopting a plan under this division, the legislative authority or board
shall hold at least two public hearings on the plan. Before the first hearing, the legislative authority
or board shall publish notice of the hearings once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper
of general circulation in the jurisdiction or as provided in section 7.16 of the Revised Code. The
notice shall summarize the plan and state the date, time, and location of each hearing.
(D) No legislative authority or board, pursuant to an ordinance or resolution under divisions
(A) and (B) of this section that provides for automatic aggregation of customers that are not
mercantile customers as described in division (A) of this section, shall aggregate the electrical load
of any electric load center located within its jurisdiction unless it in advance clearly discloses to the
person owning, occupying, controlling, or using the load center that the person will be enrolled
automatically in the aggregation program and will remain so enrolled unless the person affirmatively

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
58
elects by a stated procedure not to be so enrolled. The disclosure shall state prominently the rates,
charges, and other terms and conditions of enrollment. The stated procedure shall allow any person
enrolled in the aggregation program the opportunity to opt out of the program every three years,
without paying a switching fee. Any such person that opts out before the commencement of the
aggregation program pursuant to the stated procedure shall default to the standard service offer
provided under section 4928.14 or division (D) of section 4928.35 of the Revised Code until the
person chooses an alternative supplier.
(E)(1) With respect to a governmental aggregation for a municipal corporation that is
authorized pursuant to divisions (A) to (D) of this section, resolutions may be proposed by initiative
or referendum petitions in accordance with sections 731.28 to 731.41 of the Revised Code.
(2) With respect to a governmental aggregation for a township or the unincorporated area of
a county, which aggregation is authorized pursuant to divisions (A) to (D) of this section, resolutions
may be proposed by initiative or referendum petitions in accordance with sections 731.28 to 731.40
of the Revised Code, except that:
(a) The petitions shall be filed, respectively, with the township fiscal officer or the board of
county commissioners, who shall perform those duties imposed under those sections upon the city
auditor or village clerk.
(b) The petitions shall contain the signatures of not less than ten per cent of the total number
of electors in, respectively, the township or the unincorporated area of the county who voted for the
office of governor at the preceding general election for that office in that area.
(F) A governmental aggregator under division (A) of this section is not a public utility
engaging in the wholesale purchase and resale of electricity, and provision of the aggregated service
is not a wholesale utility transaction. A governmental aggregator shall be subject to supervision and
regulation by the public utilities commission only to the extent of any competitive retail electric
service it provides and commission authority under this chapter.
(G) This section does not apply in the case of a municipal corporation that supplies such
aggregated service to electric load centers to which its municipal electric utility also supplies a
noncompetitive retail electric service through transmission or distribution facilities the utility singly
or jointly owns or operates.
(H) A governmental aggregator shall not include in its aggregation the accounts of any of the
following:
(1) A customer that has opted out of the aggregation;
(2) A customer in contract with a certified electric services company;
(3) A customer that has a special contract with an electric distribution utility;
(4) A customer that is not located within the governmental aggregator's governmental
boundaries;
(5) Subject to division (C) of section 4928.21 of the Revised Code, a customer who appears
on the "do not aggregate" list maintained under that section.

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
59
(I) Customers that are part of a governmental aggregation under this section shall be
responsible only for such portion of a surcharge under section 4928.144 of the Revised Code that is
proportionate to the benefits, as determined by the commission, that electric load centers within the
jurisdiction of the governmental aggregation as a group receive. The proportionate surcharge so
established shall apply to each customer of the governmental aggregation while the customer is part
of that aggregation. If a customer ceases being such a customer, the otherwise applicable surcharge
shall apply. Nothing in this section shall result in less than full recovery by an electric distribution
utility of any surcharge authorized under section 4928.144 of the Revised Code. Nothing in this
section shall result in less than the full and timely imposition, charging, collection, and adjustment
by an electric distribution utility, its assignee, or any collection agent, of the phase-in-recovery
charges authorized pursuant to a final financing order issued pursuant to sections 4928.23 to
4928.2318 of the Revised Code.
(J) On behalf of the customers that are part of a governmental aggregation under this section
and by filing written notice with the public utilities commission, the legislative authority that formed
or is forming that governmental aggregation may elect not to receive standby service within the
meaning of division (B)(2)(d) of section 4928.143 of the Revised Code from an electric distribution
utility in whose certified territory the governmental aggregation is located and that operates under an
approved electric security plan under that section. Upon the filing of that notice, the electric
distribution utility shall not charge any such customer to whom competitive retail electric generation
service is provided by another supplier under the governmental aggregation for the standby service.
Any such consumer that returns to the utility for competitive retail electric service shall pay the
market price of power incurred by the utility to serve that consumer plus any amount attributable to
the utility's cost of compliance with the renewable energy resource provisions of section 4928.64 of
the Revised Code to serve the consumer. Such market price shall include, but not be limited to,
capacity and energy charges; all charges associated with the provision of that power supply through
the regional transmission organization, including, but not limited to, transmission, ancillary services,
congestion, and settlement and administrative charges; and all other costs incurred by the utility that
are associated with the procurement, provision, and administration of that power supply, as such
costs may be approved by the commission. The period of time during which the market price and
renewable energy resource amount shall be so assessed on the consumer shall be from the time the
consumer so returns to the electric distribution utility until the expiration of the electric security
plan. However, if that period of time is expected to be more than two years, the commission may
reduce the time period to a period of not less than two years.
(K) The commission shall adopt rules and issue orders in proceedings under sections
4928.141 and 4928.142 of the Revised Code to encourage and promote large-scale governmental
aggregation in this state. For that purpose, the commission shall conduct an immediate review of any
rules it has adopted for the purpose of this section that are in effect on the effective date of the
amendment of this section by S.B. 221 of the 127th general assembly, July 31, 2008. Further, within

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
60
the context of an electric security plan under section 4928.143 of the Revised Code, the The
commission shall consider the effect on large-scale governmental aggregation of any nonbypassable
generation charges, however collected, that would be established under that plan, except any
nonbypassable generation charges that relate to any cost incurred by the review each application
filed under section 4928.142 of the Revised Code by an electric distribution utility, to ensure that the
deferral of which has been authorized by the commission prior to the effective date of application
and the amendment of this section by S.B. 221 of the 127th general assembly, July 31, 2008
resulting market rate offer shall not contain any rate, price, term, condition, or provision that would
have an adverse effect on large-scale governmental aggregation in this state.

65
changes in market conditions, including repayment schedules, interest rates, financing costs,
collateral requirements, required debt service and other reserves, and the ability of the electric
distribution utility, at its option, to effect a series of issuances of phase-in-recovery bonds and
correlated assignments, sales, pledges, or other transfers of phase-in-recovery property. Any changes
made under this section to terms and conditions for the phase-in-recovery bonds shall be in
conformance with the financing order.
(G) A financing order may provide that the creation of phase-in-recovery property shall be
simultaneous with the sale of that property to an assignee as provided in the application and the
pledge of the property to secure phase-in-recovery bonds.
(H) The commission shall, in a financing order, require that after the final terms of each
issuance of phase-in-recovery bonds have been established, and prior to the issuance of those bonds,
the electric distribution utility shall determine the resulting phase-in-recovery charges in accordance
with the adjustment mechanism described in the financing order. These phase-in-recovery charges
shall be final and effective upon the issuance of the phase-in-recovery bonds, without further
commission action.
Sec. 4928.34. (A) The public utilities commission shall not approve or prescribe a transition
plan under division (A) or (B) of section 4928.33 of the Revised Code unless the commission first
makes all of the following determinations:
(1) The unbundled components for the electric transmission component of retail electric
service, as specified in the utility's rate unbundling plan required by division (A)(1) of section
4928.31 of the Revised Code, equal the tariff rates determined by the federal energy regulatory
commission that are in effect on the date of the approval of the transition plan under sections
4928.31 to 4928.40 of the Revised Code, as each such rate is determined applicable to each
particular customer class and rate schedule by the commission. The unbundled transmission
component shall include a sliding scale of charges under division (B) of section 4905.31 of the
Revised Code to ensure that refunds determined or approved by the federal energy regulatory
commission are flowed through to retail electric customers.
(2) The unbundled components for retail electric distribution service in the rate unbundling
plan equal the difference between the costs attributable to the utility's transmission and distribution
rates and charges under its schedule of rates and charges in effect on the effective date of this
section, based upon the record in the most recent rate proceeding of the utility for which the utility's
schedule was established, and the tariff rates for electric transmission service determined by the
federal energy regulatory commission as described in division (A)(1) of this section.
(3) All other unbundled components required by the commission in the rate unbundling plan
equal the costs attributable to the particular service as reflected in the utility's schedule of rates and
charges in effect on the effective date of this section.
(4) The unbundled components for retail electric generation service in the rate unbundling
plan equal the residual amount remaining after the determination of the transmission, distribution,

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
66
and other unbundled components, and after any adjustments necessary to reflect the effects of the
amendment of section 5727.111 of the Revised Code by Sub. S.B. No. 3 of the 123rd general
assembly.
(5) All unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan have been adjusted to reflect any
base rate reductions on file with the commission and as scheduled to be in effect by December 31,
2005, under rate settlements in effect on the effective date of this section. However, all earnings
obligations, restrictions, or caps imposed on an electric utility in a commission order prior to the
effective date of this section are void.
(6) Subject to division (A)(5) of this section, the total of all unbundled components in the
rate unbundling plan are capped and shall equal during the market development period, except as
specifically provided in this chapter, the total of all rates and charges in effect under the applicable
bundled schedule of the electric utility pursuant to section 4905.30 of the Revised Code in effect on
the day before the effective date of this section, including the transition charge determined under
section 4928.40 of the Revised Code, adjusted for any changes in the taxation of electric utilities and
retail electric service under Sub. S.B. No. 3 of the 123rd General Assembly, the universal service
rider authorized by section 4928.51 of the Revised Code, and the temporary rider authorized by
section 4928.61 of the Revised Code. For the purpose of this division, the rate cap applicable to a
customer receiving electric service pursuant to an arrangement approved by the commission under
section 4905.31 of the Revised Code is, for the term of the arrangement, the total of all rates and
charges in effect under the arrangement. For any rate schedule filed pursuant to section 4905.30 of
the Revised Code or any arrangement subject to approval pursuant to section 4905.31 of the Revised
Code, the initial tax-related adjustment to the rate cap required by this division shall be equal to the
rate of taxation specified in section 5727.81 of the Revised Code and applicable to the schedule or
arrangement. To the extent such total annual amount of the tax-related adjustment is greater than or
less than the comparable amount of the total annual tax reduction experienced by the electric utility
as a result of the provisions of Sub. S.B. No. 3 of the 123rd general assembly, such difference shall
be addressed by the commission through accounting procedures, refunds, or an annual surcharge or
credit to customers, or through other appropriate means, to avoid placing the financial responsibility
for the difference upon the electric utility or its shareholders. Any adjustments in the rate of taxation
specified in section 5727.81 of the Revised Code section shall not occur without a corresponding
adjustment to the rate cap for each such rate schedule or arrangement. The department of taxation
shall advise the commission and self-assessors under section 5727.81 of the Revised Code prior to
the effective date of any change in the rate of taxation specified under that section, and the
commission shall modify the rate cap to reflect that adjustment so that the rate cap adjustment is
effective as of the effective date of the change in the rate of taxation. This division shall be applied,
to the extent possible, to eliminate any increase in the price of electricity for customers that
otherwise may occur as a result of establishing the taxes contemplated in section 5727.81 of the
Revised Code.

(iv) Electric generation equipment owned or controlled by a mercantile customer that uses a
renewable energy resource.
(2) For the purpose of this section and as it considers appropriate, the public utilities
commission may classify any new technology as such a qualifying renewable energy resource.
(B)(1) By the end of 2026, an electric distribution utility shall have provided from qualifying
renewable energy resources, including, at its discretion, qualifying renewable energy resources
obtained pursuant to an electricity supply contract, a portion of the electricity supply required for its
standard service offer under section sections 4928.141 and 4928.142 of the Revised Code, and an

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
69
electric services company shall have provided a portion of its electricity supply for retail consumers
in this state from qualifying renewable energy resources, including, at its discretion, qualifying
renewable energy resources obtained pursuant to an electricity supply contract. That portion shall
equal eight and one-half per cent of the total number of kilowatt hours of electricity sold by the
subject utility or company to any and all retail electric consumers whose electric load centers are
served by that utility and are located within the utility's certified territory or, in the case of an electric
services company, are served by the company and are located within this state. However, nothing in
this section precludes a utility or company from providing a greater percentage.
(2) Subject to section 4928.642 of the Revised Code, the The portion required under division
(B)(1) of this section shall be generated from renewable energy resources in accordance with the
following benchmarks:

(3) The qualifying renewable energy resources implemented by the utility or company shall
be met either:
(a) Through facilities located in this state; or
(b) With resources that can be shown to be deliverable into this state.
(C)(1) The commission annually shall review an electric distribution utility's or electric
services company's compliance with the most recent applicable benchmark under division (B)(2) of
this section and, in the course of that review, shall identify any undercompliance or noncompliance
of the utility or company that it determines is weather-related, related to equipment or resource
shortages for qualifying renewable energy resources as applicable, or is otherwise outside the
utility's or company's control.
(2) Subject to the cost cap provisions of division (C)(3) of this section, if the commission
determines, after notice and opportunity for hearing, and based upon its findings in that review
regarding avoidable undercompliance or noncompliance, but subject to division (C)(4) of this
section, that the utility or company has failed to comply with any such benchmark, the commission
shall impose a renewable energy compliance payment on the utility or company.
(a) The compliance payment pertaining to the solar energy resource benchmarks under
division (B)(2) of this section shall be an amount per megawatt hour of undercompliance or
noncompliance in the period under review, as follows:
(i) Three hundred dollars for 2014, 2015, and 2016;
(ii) Two hundred fifty dollars for 2017 and 2018;
(iii) Two hundred dollars for 2019.
(b) The compliance payment pertaining to the renewable energy resource benchmarks under
division (B)(2) of this section shall equal the number of additional renewable energy credits that the
electric distribution utility or electric services company would have needed to comply with the
applicable benchmark in the period under review times an amount that shall begin at forty-five
dollars and shall be adjusted annually by the commission to reflect any change in the consumer price
index as defined in section 101.27 of the Revised Code, but shall not be less than forty-five dollars.

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
71
As used in this division, "consumer price index" means the consumer price index prepared by the
United States bureau of labor statistics (U.S. city average for urban wage earners and clerical
workers: all items, 1982-1984=100), or, if that index is no longer published, a generally available
comparable index.
(c) The compliance payment shall not be passed through by the electric distribution utility or
electric services company to consumers. The compliance payment shall be remitted to the
commission, for deposit to the credit of the advanced energy fund created under section 4928.61 of
the Revised Code. Payment of the compliance payment shall be subject to such collection and
enforcement procedures as apply to the collection of a forfeiture under sections 4905.55 to 4905.60
and 4905.64 of the Revised Code.
(3) An electric distribution utility or an electric services company need not comply with a
benchmark under division (B)(2) of this section to the extent that its reasonably expected cost of that
compliance exceeds its reasonably expected cost of otherwise producing or acquiring the requisite
electricity by three per cent or more. The cost of compliance shall be calculated as though any
exemption from taxes and assessments had not been granted under section 5727.75 of the Revised
Code.
(4)(a) An electric distribution utility or electric services company may request the
commission to make a force majeure determination pursuant to this division regarding all or part of
the utility's or company's compliance with any minimum benchmark under division (B)(2) of this
section during the period of review occurring pursuant to division (C)(2) of this section. The
commission may require the electric distribution utility or electric services company to make
solicitations for renewable energy resource credits as part of its default service before the utility's or
company's request of force majeure under this division can be made.
(b) Within ninety days after the filing of a request by an electric distribution utility or
electric services company under division (C)(4)(a) of this section, the commission shall determine if
qualifying renewable energy resources are reasonably available in the marketplace in sufficient
quantities for the utility or company to comply with the subject minimum benchmark during the
review period. In making this determination, the commission shall consider whether the electric
distribution utility or electric services company has made a good faith effort to acquire sufficient
qualifying renewable energy or, as applicable, solar energy resources to so comply, including, but
not limited to, by banking or seeking renewable energy resource credits or by seeking the resources
through long-term contracts. Additionally, the commission shall consider the availability of
qualifying renewable energy or solar energy resources in this state and other jurisdictions in the PJM
interconnection regional transmission organization, L.L.C., or its successor and the midcontinent
independent system operator or its successor.
(c) If, pursuant to division (C)(4)(b) of this section, the commission determines that
qualifying renewable energy or solar energy resources are not reasonably available to permit the
electric distribution utility or electric services company to comply, during the period of review, with

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
72
the subject minimum benchmark prescribed under division (B)(2) of this section, the commission
shall modify that compliance obligation of the utility or company as it determines appropriate to
accommodate the finding. Commission modification shall not automatically reduce the obligation
for the electric distribution utility's or electric services company's compliance in subsequent years. If
it modifies the electric distribution utility or electric services company obligation under division (C)
(4)(c) of this section, the commission may require the utility or company, if sufficient renewable
energy resource credits exist in the marketplace, to acquire additional renewable energy resource
credits in subsequent years equivalent to the utility's or company's modified obligation under
division (C)(4)(c) of this section.
(5) The commission shall establish a process to provide for at least an annual review of the
renewable energy resource market in this state and in the service territories of the regional
transmission organizations that manage transmission systems located in this state. The commission
shall use the results of this study to identify any needed changes to the amount of the renewable
energy compliance payment specified under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of this section. Specifically,
the commission may increase the amount to ensure that payment of compliance payments is not used
to achieve compliance with this section in lieu of actually acquiring or realizing energy derived from
qualifying renewable energy resources. However, if the commission finds that the amount of the
compliance payment should be otherwise changed, the commission shall present this finding to the
general assembly for legislative enactment.
(D) The commission annually shall submit to the general assembly in accordance with
section 101.68 of the Revised Code a report describing all of the following:
(1) The compliance of electric distribution utilities and electric services companies with
division (B) of this section;
(2) The average annual cost of renewable energy credits purchased by utilities and
companies for the year covered in the report;
(3) Any strategy for utility and company compliance or for encouraging the use of qualifying
renewable energy resources in supplying this state's electricity needs in a manner that considers
available technology, costs, job creation, and economic impacts.
The commission shall begin providing the information described in division (D)(2) of this
section in each report submitted after September 10, 2012. The commission shall allow and consider
public comments on the report prior to its submission to the general assembly. Nothing in the report
shall be binding on any person, including any utility or company for the purpose of its compliance
with any benchmark under division (B) of this section, or the enforcement of that provision under
division (C) of this section.
(E) All costs incurred by an electric distribution utility in complying with the requirements
of this section shall be bypassable by any consumer that has exercised choice of supplier under
section 4928.03 of the Revised Code.
Sec. 4928.645. (A) An electric distribution utility or electric services company may use, for

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
73
the purpose of complying with the requirements under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of section 4928.64 of
the Revised Code, renewable energy credits any time in the five calendar years following the date of
their purchase or acquisition from any entity, including, but not limited to, the following:
(1) A mercantile customer;
(2) An owner or operator of a hydroelectric generating facility that is located at a dam on a
river, or on any water discharged to a river, that is within or bordering this state or within or
bordering an adjoining state, or that produces power that can be shown to be deliverable into this
state;
(3) A seller of compressed natural gas that has been produced from biologically derived
methane gas, provided that the seller may only provide renewable energy credits for metered
amounts of gas.
(B)(1) The public utilities commission shall adopt rules specifying that one unit of credit
shall equal one megawatt hour of electricity derived from renewable energy resources, except that,
for a generating facility of seventy-five megawatts or greater that is situated within this state and has
committed by December 31, 2009, to modify or retrofit its generating unit or units to enable the
facility to generate principally from biomass energy by June 30, 2013, each megawatt hour of
electricity generated principally from that biomass energy shall equal, in units of credit, the product
obtained by multiplying the actual percentage of biomass feedstock heat input used to generate such
megawatt hour by the quotient obtained by dividing the then existing unit dollar amount used to
determine a renewable energy compliance payment as provided under division (C)(2)(b) of section
4928.64 of the Revised Code by the then existing market value of one renewable energy credit, but
such megawatt hour shall not equal less than one unit of credit. Renewable energy resources do not
have to be converted to electricity in order to be eligible to receive renewable energy credits. The
rules shall specify that, for purposes of converting the quantity of energy derived from biologically
derived methane gas to an electricity equivalent, one megawatt hour equals 3,412,142 British
thermal units.
(2) The rules also shall provide for this state a system of registering renewable energy credits
by specifying which of any generally available registries shall be used for that purpose and not by
creating a registry. That selected system of registering renewable energy credits shall allow a
hydroelectric generating facility to be eligible for obtaining renewable energy credits and shall allow
customer-sited projects or actions the broadest opportunities to be eligible for obtaining renewable
energy credits.
(C) Beginning January 1, 2020, a qualifying solar resource as defined in section 3706.40 of
the Revised Code is not eligible to obtain a renewable energy credit under this section for any
megawatt hour for which the resource has been issued a solar energy credit under section 3706.45 of
the Revised Code.
(D) Except for compressed natural gas that has been produced from biologically derived
methane gas, energy generated by using natural gas as a resource is not eligible to obtain a

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
74
renewable energy credit under this section.
Sec. 4928.73. (A) As used in this section:
(1) "Mercantile customer member" means a mercantile customer connected to a mercantile
customer self-power system.
(2) "Mercantile customer self-power system" means one or more electric generation
facilities, electric storage facilities, or both, along with any associated facilities, that meet all of the
following:

(c) Deliver electricity to the mercantile customer member's side of the electric meter without
the use of an electric distribution utility's or electric cooperative's distribution system or transmission
system;
(d) Is located on either of the following:
(i) A property owned or controlled by a mercantile customer member or the entity that owns
or operates the mercantile customer self-power system;
(ii) Land adjacent to a mercantile customer member if the facilities connect directly with the
customer.
(B) The mercantile customer self-power system may be owned or operated by a mercantile
customer member, group of mercantile customer members, or an entity that is not a mercantile
customer member.
(C) A mercantile customer self-power system may provide electric generation service to one
or more mercantile customers.
(D) The public utilities commission shall adopt rules to implement this section that are
applicable to electric distribution utilities.
(E) Nothing in this section prohibits an electric distribution utility or an electric cooperative
from charging a mercantile customer for distribution or transmission service used by a mercantile
customer.
Sec. 4928.83. (A) Not later than May 31, 2026, every electric distribution utility in the state
shall develop and publicly share distribution system hosting capacity maps. The utility shall ensure
that the maps are available on the utility's web site and shall be updated at least once per quarter.
(B) The maps described in division (A) of this section shall include, at a minimum:
(1) Total available distribution hosting capacity, expressed in megawatts, for new loads;

(5) Available substation and circuit capacity expressed in megawatts.
(C) The public utilities commission shall hold at least two stakeholder meetings annually to
receive input on map design, data accuracy, and usability. In addition, the commission shall establish
uniform reporting standards to ensure consistency across all electric distribution utilities. The
commission may also require utilities to include additional data points as necessary to improve
transparency and planning.
(D) Each electric distribution utility shall publish annual reliability reports, including the
following metrics, identified per circuit:
(1) The system average interruption frequency index, representing the average number of
interruptions per customer;
(2) The customer average interruption duration index, representing the average interruption
duration or average time to restore service per interrupted customer;
(3) Customers experiencing multiple interruptions, which identifies customers experiencing
at least five interruptions annually divided by the total number of customers served;
(4) Customers experiencing long interruption durations, which identifies customers that
experienced outages of one or more hours in duration divided by the total number of customers
served;
(5) Average outage frequency and duration per circuit and substation;
(6) Identification of circuits and substations with persistent reliability issues;
(7) Planned and completed upgrades to enhance grid reliability.

Sec. 4928.86. (A) Except as provided in division (C) of this section, each entity that owns or
controls transmission facilities located in this state and is not a regional transmission organization
shall create a heat map that includes both of the following:
(1) For major transmission lines and substations, the additional power load the lines and
substations can take at the time that the map is created, accounting for all signed electric service
agreements;
(2) The amount of localized generation that can be hosted on each transmission line.
(B) If a heat map created under this section is not critical electric infrastructure information,
then the entity that created the map shall publish the map on the entity's web site.
(C) The following entities are exempt from the requirements of this section:
(1) An electric utility owned or operated by a municipal corporation;
(2) An electric cooperative.
Sec. 4929.20. (A)(A)(1) No governmental aggregator as defined in division (K)(1) of section
4929.01 of the Revised Code or no retail natural gas supplier shall provide a competitive retail
natural gas service on or after thirteen months following the effective date of this section June 26,
2001, to a consumer in this state without first being certified by the public utilities commission

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
76
regarding its managerial, technical, and financial capability to provide that service and providing
reasonable financial assurances sufficient to protect customers and natural gas companies from
default. In addition, a retail natural gas supplier may be required to provide a performance bond
sufficient to protect customers and natural gas companies from default. Certification shall be granted
pursuant to procedures and standards the commission shall prescribe in accordance with rules
adopted under section 4929.10 of the Revised Code. However, certification or certification renewal
shall be deemed approved thirty days after the filing of an application with the commission unless
the commission suspends that approval for good cause shown. In the case of such a suspension, the
commission shall act to approve or deny certification or certification renewal to the applicant not
later than ninety days after the date of the suspension.
(2) The commission shall establish rules to require a competitive retail natural gas supplier
to maintain financial assurances sufficient to protect customers and natural gas companies from
default. Such rules also shall specifically allow a natural gas company to set reasonable standards for
its security and the security of its customers through financial requirements set in its tariffs.
(3) As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "retail natural gas supplier" has the same
meaning as in section 4929.01 of the Revised Code, but excludes a broker or aggregator.
(B) Capability standards adopted in rules pursuant to division (A) of this section shall be
sufficient to ensure compliance with section 4929.22 of the Revised Code and with the minimum
service requirements established under section 4929.23 of the Revised Code. The standards shall
allow flexibility for voluntary aggregation, to encourage market creativity in responding to
consumer needs and demands. The rules shall include procedures for biennially renewing
certification.
(C)(1) The commission may suspend, rescind, or conditionally rescind the certification of
any retail natural gas supplier or governmental aggregator issued under this section if the
commission determines, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing, that the retail natural
gas supplier or governmental aggregator has failed to comply with any applicable certification
standards prescribed in rules adopted pursuant to this section or section 4929.22 of the Revised
Code.
(2) An affected natural gas company may file an application with the commission for
approval of authority to recover in accordance with division (C)(2) of this section incremental costs
reasonably and prudently incurred by the company in connection with the commission's
continuation, suspension, rescission, or conditional rescission of a particular retail natural gas
supplier's certification under division (C)(1) of this section. Upon the filing of such an application,
the commission shall conduct an audit of such incremental costs as are specified in the application.
Cost recovery shall be through a rider on the base rates of customers of the company for which there
is a choice of supplier of commodity sales service as a result of revised schedules approved under
division (C) of section 4929.29 of the Revised Code, a rule or order adopted or issued by the
commission under Chapter 4905. of the Revised Code, or an exemption granted by the commission

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
77
under sections 4929.04 to 4929.08 of the Revised Code. The rider shall take effect ninety days after
the date of the application's filing unless the commission, based on the audit results and for good
cause shown, sets the matter for hearing. After the hearing, the commission shall approve the
application, and authorize such cost recovery rider effective on the date specified in the order, only
for such incremental costs as the commission determines were reasonably and prudently incurred by
the company in connection with the continuation, suspension, rescission, or conditional rescission of
a retail natural gas supplier's certification under division (C)(1) of this section. Any proceeding
under division (C)(2) of this section shall be governed by Chapter 4903. of the Revised Code.
(D) No natural gas company, on and after thirteen months following the effective date of this
section June 26, 2001, shall knowingly distribute natural gas, to a retail consumer in this state, for
any governmental aggregator, as defined in division (K)(1) of section 4929.01 of the Revised Code,
or retail natural gas supplier, that has not been certified by the commission pursuant to this section.
(E) Notwithstanding any provision of section 121.95 of the Revised Code to the contrary, a
regulatory restriction contained in a rule adopted under section 4929.20 of the Revised Code is not
subject to sections 121.95 to 121.953 of the Revised Code.
Sec. 4929.221. (A) If a competitive retail natural gas service supplier offers a residential
customer or non-mercantile commercial customer a contract for a fixed introductory rate that
converts to a variable rate upon the expiration of the fixed rate, the supplier shall send two notices to
each residential customer and non-mercantile commercial customer that enters into such a contract.
Each notice shall provide all of the following information to the customer:
(1) The fixed rate that is expiring under the contract;
(2) The expiration date of the contract's fixed rate;
(3) The public utilities commission web site that, as a comparison tool, lists rates offered by
competitive retail natural gas service suppliers.
(B) The second notice shall include all the information required under division (A) of this
section and shall also identify the initial rate to be charged upon the contract's conversion to a
variable rate.
(C) The notices shall be sent by standard United States mail or electronically with a
customer's verifiable consent as follows:
(1) The supplier shall send the first notice not earlier than ninety days and not later than sixty
days prior to the expiration of the fixed rate.
(2) The supplier shall send the second notice not earlier than forty-five days and not later
than fifteen days prior to the expiration of the fixed rate.
(D) A competitive retail natural gas service supplier shall provide an annual notice, by
standard United States mail or electronically with a customer's verifiable consent, to each residential
customer and non-mercantile commercial customer that has entered into a contract with the supplier
that has converted to a variable rate upon the expiration of the contract's fixed introductory rate. The
notice shall inform the customer that the customer is currently subject to a variable rate and that

Sub. H. B. No. 15 136th G.A.
78
other fixed rate contracts are available.
(E) Not later than one hundred fifty days after the effective date of this section, the
commission shall adopt rules in order to implement divisions (A) to (D) of this section. The rules, at
a minimum, shall include the following requirements regarding the notices required under divisions
(A) to (D) of this section:
