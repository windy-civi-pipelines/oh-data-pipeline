Sec. 4909.08. When the public utilities commission has 1245
completed the valuation of the property of any public utility or 1246
railroad and before such valuation becomes final, it shall give 1247
notice by registered letter to such public utility or railroad, 1248
and if a substantial portion of said public utility or railroad 1249
is situated in a municipal corporation, then to the mayor of 1250
such municipal corporation, stating the valuations placed upon 1251
the several kinds and classes of property of such public utility 1252
or railroad and upon the property as a whole and give such 1253
further notice by publication or otherwise as it shall deem 1254
necessary to apprise the public of such valuation. If, within 1255
thirty days after such notification, no protest has been filed 1256
with the commission, such valuation becomes final. If notice of 1257
protest has been filed by any public utility or railroad, the 1258
commission shall fix a time for hearing such protest and shall 1259
consider at such hearing any matter material thereto presented 1260
by such public utility, railroad, or municipal corporation, in 1261
support of its protest or by any representative of the public 1262
against such protest. If, after the hearing of any protest of 1263
any valuation so fixed, the commission is of the opinion that 1264
its inventory is incomplete or inaccurate or that its valuation 1265
is incorrect, it shall make such changes as are necessary and 1266
shall issue an order making such corrected valuations final. A 1267
final valuation by the commission and all classifications made 1268
for the ascertainment of such valuations shall be public and are 1269
prima-facie evidence relative to the value of the property. 1270

are to be fixed and determined. 1300
(c) The valuation so determined under division (A)(1) of 1301
this section for any public utility shall be the total value as 1302
set forth in division (C)(9)(B)(8) of section 4909.042 of the 1303
Revised Code and division (B)(9) of section 4909.05 of the 1304
Revised Code, and a reasonable allowance for materials and 1305
supplies and a reasonable allowance for cash working capital as 1306
determined by the commission. 1307
The commission, in its discretion, may include in the 1308
valuation a reasonable allowance for construction work in 1309
progress but, in no event, may such an allowance be made by the 1310
commission until it has determined that the particular 1311
construction project is at least seventy-five per cent complete. 1312
In determining the percentage completion of a particular 1313
construction project, the commission shall consider, among other 1314
relevant criteria, the per cent of time elapsed in construction; 1315
the per cent of construction funds, excluding allowance for 1316
funds used during construction, expended, or obligated to such 1317
construction funds budgeted where all such funds are adjusted to 1318
reflect current purchasing power; and any physical inspection 1319
performed by or on behalf of any party, including the 1320
commission's staff. 1321

As Passed by the House
progress shall not be included in the valuation as plant in 1329
service until such time as the total revenue effect of the 1330
construction work in progress allowance is offset by the total 1331
revenue effect of the plant in service exclusion. Carrying 1332
charges calculated in a manner similar to allowance for funds 1333
used during construction shall accrue on that portion of the 1334
project in service but not reflected in rates as plant in 1335
service, and such accrued carrying charges shall be included in 1336
the valuation of the property at the conclusion of the offset 1337
period for purposes of division (C)(9) of section 4909.05 of the 1338
Revised Code. 1339
From and after April 10, 1985, no allowance for 1340
construction work in progress as it relates to a particular 1341
construction project shall be reflected in rates for a period 1342
exceeding forty-eight consecutive months commencing on the date 1343
the initial rates reflecting such allowance become effective, 1344
except as otherwise provided in this division. 1345
The applicable maximum period in rates for an allowance 1346
for construction work in progress as it relates to a particular 1347
construction project shall be tolled if, and to the extent, a 1348
delay in the in-service date of the project is caused by the 1349
action or inaction of any federal, state, county, or municipal 1350
agency having jurisdiction, where such action or inaction 1351
relates to a change in a rule, standard, or approval of such 1352
agency, and where such action or inaction is not the result of 1353
the failure of the utility to reasonably endeavor to comply with 1354
any rule, standard, or approval prior to such change. 1355
In the event that such period expires before the project 1356
goes into service, the commission shall exclude, from the date 1357
of expiration, the allowance for the project as construction 1358

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 48
As Passed by the House
work in progress from rates, except that the commission may 1359
extend the expiration date up to twelve months for good cause 1360
shown. 1361
In the event that a utility has permanently canceled, 1362
abandoned, or terminated construction of a project for which it 1363
was previously permitted a construction work in progress 1364
allowance, the commission immediately shall exclude the 1365
allowance for the project from the valuation. 1366
In the event that a construction work in progress project 1367
previously included in the valuation is removed from the 1368
valuation pursuant to this division, any revenues collected by 1369
the utility from its customers after April 10, 1985, that 1370
resulted from such prior inclusion shall be offset against 1371
future revenues over the same period of time as the project was 1372
included in the valuation as construction work in progress. The 1373
total revenue effect of such offset shall not exceed the total 1374
revenues previously collected. 1375
In no event shall the total revenue effect of any offset 1376
or offsets provided under division (A)(1) of this section exceed 1377
the total revenue effect of any construction work in progress 1378
allowance. 1379
(2) A fair and reasonable rate of return to the utility on 1380
the valuation as determined in division (A)(1) of this section; 1381
(3) The dollar annual return to which the utility is 1382
entitled by applying the fair and reasonable rate of return as 1383
determined under division (A)(2) of this section to the 1384
valuation of the utility determined under division (A)(1) of 1385
this section; 1386

period. 1392
(a) Federal, state, and local taxes imposed on or measured 1393
by net income may, in the discretion of the commission, be 1394
computed by the normalization method of accounting, provided the 1395
utility maintains accounting reserves that reflect differences 1396
between taxes actually payable and taxes on a normalized basis, 1397
provided that no determination as to the treatment in the rate- 1398
making process of such taxes shall be made that will result in 1399
loss of any tax depreciation or other tax benefit to which the 1400
utility would otherwise be entitled, and further provided that 1401
such tax benefit as redounds to the utility as a result of such 1402
a computation may not be retained by the company, used to fund 1403
any dividend or distribution, or utilized for any purpose other 1404
than the defrayal of the operating expenses of the utility and 1405
the defrayal of the expenses of the utility in connection with 1406
construction work. 1407

light company under section 5727.391 of the Revised Code for 1409
Ohio coal burned prior to January 1, 2000, shall not be retained 1410
by the company, used to fund any dividend or distribution, or 1411
utilized for any purposes other than the defrayal of the 1412
allowable operating expenses of the company and the defrayal of 1413
the allowable expenses of the company in connection with the 1414
installation, acquisition, construction, or use of a compliance 1415
facility. The amount of the tax credits granted to an electric 1416
light company under that section for Ohio coal burned prior to 1417
January 1, 2000, shall be returned to its customers within three 1418

return under division (A)(3) of this section to the cost, for 1427
the test period used for the determination under division (C)(1) 1428
of this section, of rendering the public utility service under 1429
division (A)(4) of this section. 1430

the revenues and expenses of the utility shall be determined 1432
during a test period. The utility may as follows: 1433
(a) Electric light companies may propose a forecasted test 1434
period. If the company proposes a forecasted test period, the 1435
company shall propose annual base rates for three consecutive 1436
twelve-month periods in a single forecasted test period 1437
application. 1438
During the first twelve-month period, the company shall 1439
propose a reasonably forecasted rate base during a thirteen- 1440
month average, revenues, and expenses for the first twelve 1441
months that new base rates will be in effect. 1442
During the second twelve-month period, the base rate 1443
revenue requirement shall be adjusted for the return of, and 1444
return on, incremental rate base additions approved by the 1445
commission in the initial application. During the third twelve- 1446
month period, the base rate revenue requirement shall be 1447

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 51
As Passed by the House
adjusted for the return of and return on incremental rate base 1448
additions approved by the commission in the initial application. 1449
For each twelve-month period, forecasted plant investment, 1450
forecasted revenues, and forecasted expenses versus actual 1451
investment, actual revenues, and actual expenses shall be trued 1452
up via a cost recovery mechanism approved by the commission. 1453
Each true-up process shall include an adjustment to actual 1454
for the rate of return that the company is authorized to earn on 1455
the actual investments made. The company shall provide the 1456
commission with actual financial information during the true-up 1457
process to ensure accuracy. As part of the true-up process, the 1458
commission shall include only rate base components that have 1459
been found by the commission to be used and useful in rendering 1460
public utility service. 1461
At the end of the last test period, the company shall file 1462
for a rate case under section 4909.18 of the Revised Code. 1463
(b) All utilities, except for electric light companies 1464
that choose to file under division (C)(1)(a) of this section, 1465
shall propose a test period for this determination that is any 1466
twelve-month period beginning not more than six months prior to 1467
the date the application is filed and ending not more than nine 1468
months subsequent to that date. The test period for determining 1469
revenues and expenses of the utility shall be the test period 1470
proposed by the utility, unless otherwise ordered by the 1471
commission. 1472
(2) The For utilities filing under division (C)(1)(b) of 1473
this section, the date certain shall be not later than the date 1474
of filing, except that it shall be, for a natural gas, water- 1475

period immediately following the test period, reasonably 1483
expected to occur. The natural gas, water-works, or sewage 1484
disposal system company utility shall identify and quantify, 1485
individually, any proposed adjustments. The commission shall 1486
incorporate the proposed adjustments into the determination if 1487
the adjustments are just and reasonable. 1488

and after making the determinations under divisions (A) and (B) 1490
of this section, that any rate, fare, charge, toll, rental, 1491

pursuant to division (B) of section 4909.43 of the Revised Code 1630
to increase any existing rate, joint rate, toll, classification, 1631

to require an electric services company to maintain financial 2527
assurances sufficient to protect customers and electric 2528
distribution utilities from default. Such rules also shall 2529
specifically allow an electric distribution utility to set 2530
reasonable standards for its security and the security of its 2531
customers through financial requirements set in its tariffs. 2532

(C) Capability standards adopted in rules under division 2537
(B) of this section shall be sufficient to ensure compliance 2538
with the minimum service requirements established under section 2539
4928.10 of the Revised Code and with section 4928.09 of the 2540
Revised Code. The standards shall allow flexibility for 2541

engaged in anticompetitive or unfair, deceptive, or 2555
unconscionable acts or practices in this state. 2556
(E) No electric distribution utility on and after the 2557
starting date of competitive retail electric service shall 2558
knowingly distribute electricity, to a retail consumer in this 2559
state, for any supplier of electricity that has not been 2560
certified by the commission pursuant to this section. 2561

division (D) of section 4928.143 of the Revised Code, any rate . 2711
Each security plan that extends approved before the effective 2712
date of the amendments to this section by this act shall extend 2713
beyond December 31, 2008, shall continue to be in effect for the 2714
subject electric distribution utility for the duration of the 2715
plan's termthrough the final standard service offer auction 2716
delivery period approved by the public utilities commission 2717
under the plan as of the effective date of the amendments to 2718

(3) A standard service offer under section 4928.142 or 2720
4928.143 of the Revised Code shall exclude any previously 2721
authorized allowances for transition costs, with such exclusion 2722
being effective on and after the date that the allowance is 2723
scheduled to end under the utility's rate electric security 2724
plan. 2725
(B) The commission shall set the time for hearing of a 2726
filing under section 4928.142 or 4928.143 of the Revised Code, 2727
send written notice of the hearing to the electric distribution 2728
utility, and publish notice in a newspaper of general 2729
circulation in each county in the utility's certified territory. 2730
The commission shall adopt rules regarding filings under those 2731
sections the section. 2732
Sec. 4928.142. (A) For the purpose of complying with 2733
section 4928.141 of the Revised Code and subject to division (D) 2734
of this section and, as applicable, subject to the rate plan 2735
requirement requirements of division (A) of section 4928.141 of 2736
the Revised Code, an electric distribution utility may shall 2737
establish a standard service offer price for retail electric 2738

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 95
As Passed by the House
generation service that is delivered to the utility under a 2739
market-rate offer. 2740
(1) The market-rate offer shall be determined through a 2741
competitive bidding process that provides for all of the 2742
following: 2743
(a) Open, fair, and transparent competitive solicitation; 2744
(b) Clear product definition; 2745
(c) Standardized bid evaluation criteria; 2746
(d) Oversight by an independent third party that shall 2747
design the solicitation, administer the bidding, and ensure that 2748
the criteria specified in division divisions (A)(1)(a) to (c) of 2749
this section are met; 2750
(e) Evaluation of the submitted bids prior to the 2751
selection of the least-cost bid winner or winners. 2752

participating in the bidding process. 2754
(2) The public utilities commission shall modify rules, or 2755
adopt new rules as necessary, concerning the conduct of the 2756
competitive bidding process and the qualifications of bidders, 2757
which rules shall foster supplier participation in the bidding 2758
process and shall be consistent with the requirements of 2759
division (A)(1) of this section. 2760
(B) Prior to initiating a competitive bidding process for 2761
a market-rate offer under division (A) of this section, the 2762
electric distribution utility shall file an application with the 2763
commission. An electric distribution utility may file its 2764
application with the commission prior to the effective date of 2765
the commission rules required under division (A)(2) of this 2766

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 96
As Passed by the House
section, and, as the commission determines necessary, the 2767
utility shall immediately conform its filing to the rules upon 2768
their taking effect. 2769
An application under this division shall detail the 2770
electric distribution utility's proposed compliance with the 2771
requirements of division (A)(1) of this section and with 2772
commission rules under division (A)(2) of this section and 2773
demonstrate that all of the following requirements are met: 2774
(1) The electric distribution utility or its transmission 2775
service affiliate belongs to at least one regional transmission 2776
organization that has been approved by the federal energy 2777
regulatory commission; or there otherwise is comparable and 2778
nondiscriminatory access to the electric transmission grid. 2779
(2) Any such regional transmission organization has a 2780
market-monitor function and the ability to take actions to 2781
identify and mitigate market power or the electric distribution 2782
utility's market conduct; or a similar market monitoring 2783
function exists with commensurate ability to identify and 2784
monitor market conditions and mitigate conduct associated with 2785
the exercise of market power. 2786
(3) A published source of information is available 2787
publicly or through subscription that identifies pricing 2788
information for traded electricity on- and off-peak energy 2789
products that are contracts for delivery beginning at least two 2790
years from the date of the publication and is updated on a 2791
regular basis. 2792
The commission shall initiate a proceeding and, within 2793
ninety days after the application's filing date, shall determine 2794
by order whether the electric distribution utility and its 2795

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 97
As Passed by the House
market-rate offer meet all of the foregoing requirements. If the 2796
finding is positive, the electric distribution utility may shall 2797
initiate its competitive bidding process. If the finding is 2798
negative as to one or more requirements, the commission in the 2799
order shall direct the electric distribution utility regarding 2800
how any deficiency may shall be timely remedied in a timely 2801
manner to the commission's satisfaction; otherwise, the electric 2802
distribution utility shall withdraw the application. However, if 2803
such remedy is made and the subsequent finding is positive and 2804
also if the electric distribution utility made a simultaneous 2805
filing under this section and section 4928.143 of the Revised 2806
Code, the utility shall not initiate its competitive bid until 2807
at least one hundred fifty days after the filing date of those 2808
applications. 2809
(C) Upon the completion of the competitive bidding process 2810
authorized by divisions (A) and (B) of this section, including 2811
for the purpose of division (D) of this section, the commission 2812
shall select the least-cost bid winner or winners of that 2813
process, and such selected bid or bids, as prescribed as retail 2814
rates by the commission, shall be the electric distribution 2815
utility's standard service offer unless the commission, by order 2816
issued before the third calendar day following the conclusion of 2817
the competitive bidding process for the market rate offer, 2818
determines that one or more of the following criteria were not 2819
met: 2820
(1) Each portion of the bidding process was 2821
oversubscribed, such that the amount of supply bid upon was 2822
greater than the amount of the load bid out. 2823
(2) There were four or more bidders. 2824
(3) At least twenty-five per cent of the load is bid upon 2825

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 98
As Passed by the House
by one or more persons other than the electric distribution 2826
utility. 2827
All costs incurred by the electric distribution utility as 2828
a result of or related to the competitive bidding process or to 2829
procuring generation service to provide the standard service 2830
offer, including the costs of energy and capacity and the costs 2831
of all other products and services procured as a result of the 2832
competitive bidding process, shall be timely recovered through 2833
the standard service offer price, and, for that purpose, the 2834
commission shall approve a reconciliation mechanism, other 2835
recovery mechanism, or a combination of such mechanisms for the 2836
utility. 2837
(D) The first application filed under this section by an 2838
electric distribution utility that, as of July 31, 2008, 2839
directly owns, in whole or in part, operating electric 2840
generating facilities that had been used and useful in this 2841
state shall require that a portion of that the utility's 2842
standard service offer load for the first five years of the 2843
market rate offer be competitively bid under division (A) of 2844
this section as follows: ten per cent of the load in year one, 2845
not more than twenty per cent in year two, thirty per cent in 2846
year three, forty per cent in year four, and fifty per cent in 2847
year five. Consistent with those percentages, the commission 2848
shall determine the actual percentages for each year of years 2849
one through five. The standard service offer price for retail 2850
electric generation service under this first application shall 2851
be a proportionate blend of the bid price and the generation 2852
service price for the remaining standard service offer load, 2853
which latter price shall be equal to the electric distribution 2854
utility's most recent standard service offer price, adjusted 2855
upward or downward as the commission determines reasonable, 2856

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 99
As Passed by the House
relative to the jurisdictional portion of any known and 2857
measurable changes from the level of any one or more of the 2858
following costs as reflected in that most recent standard 2859
service offer price: 2860
(1) The electric distribution utility's prudently incurred 2861
cost of fuel used to produce electricity; 2862
(2) Its prudently incurred purchased power costs; 2863
(3) Its prudently incurred costs of satisfying the supply 2864
and demand portfolio requirements of this state, including, but 2865
not limited to, renewable energy resource and energy efficiency 2866
requirements; 2867
(4) Its costs prudently incurred to comply with 2868
environmental laws and regulations, with consideration of the 2869
derating of any facility associated with those costs. 2870
In making any adjustment to the most recent standard 2871
service offer price on the basis of costs described in division 2872
(D) of this section, the commission shall include the benefits 2873
that may become available to the electric distribution utility 2874
as a result of or in connection with the costs included in the 2875
adjustment, including, but not limited to, the utility's receipt 2876
of emissions credits or its receipt of tax benefits or of other 2877
benefits, and, accordingly, the commission may impose such 2878
conditions on the adjustment to ensure that any such benefits 2879
are properly aligned with the associated cost responsibility. 2880
The commission shall also determine how such adjustments will 2881
affect the electric distribution utility's return on common 2882
equity that may be achieved by those adjustments. The commission 2883
shall not apply its consideration of the return on common equity 2884
to reduce any adjustments authorized under this division unless 2885

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 100
As Passed by the House
the adjustments will cause the electric distribution utility to 2886
earn a return on common equity that is significantly in excess 2887
of the return on common equity that is earned by publicly traded 2888
companies, including utilities, that face comparable business 2889
and financial risk, with such adjustments for capital structure 2890
as may be appropriate. The burden of proof for demonstrating 2891
that significantly excessive earnings will not occur shall be on 2892
the electric distribution utility. 2893
Additionally, the commission may adjust the electric 2894
distribution utility's most recent standard service offer price 2895
by such just and reasonable amount that the commission 2896
determines necessary to address any emergency that threatens the 2897
utility's financial integrity or to ensure that the resulting 2898
revenue available to the utility for providing the standard 2899
service offer is not so inadequate as to result, directly or 2900
indirectly, in a taking of property without compensation 2901
pursuant to Section 19 of Article I, Ohio Constitution. The 2902
electric distribution utility has the burden of demonstrating 2903
that any adjustment to its most recent standard service offer 2904
price is proper in accordance with this division. 2905
(E) Beginning in the second year of a blended price under 2906
division (D) of this section and notwithstanding any other 2907
requirement of this section, the commission may alter 2908
prospectively the proportions specified in that division to 2909
mitigate any effect of an abrupt or significant change in the 2910
electric distribution utility's standard service offer price 2911
that would otherwise result in general or with respect to any 2912
rate group or rate schedule but for such alteration. Any such 2913
alteration shall be made not more often than annually, and the 2914
commission shall not, by altering those proportions and in any 2915
event, including because of the length of time, as authorized 2916

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 101
As Passed by the House
under division (C) of this section, taken to approve the market 2917
rate offer, cause the duration of the blending period to exceed 2918
ten years as counted from the effective date of the approved 2919
market rate offer. Additionally, any such alteration shall be 2920
limited to an alteration affecting the prospective proportions 2921
used during the blending period and shall not affect any 2922
blending proportion previously approved and applied by the 2923
commission under this division. 2924
(F) An electric distribution utility that has received 2925
commission approval of its first application under division (C) 2926
of this section shall not, nor ever shall be authorized or 2927
required by the commission to, file an application under section 2928
4928.143 of the Revised Code. 2929
Sec. 4928.144. The public utilities commission by order 2930
may authorize any just and reasonable phase-in of any electric 2931
distribution utility rate or price established under sections 2932
4928.141 to 4928.143 and 4928.142 of the Revised Code, and 2933
inclusive of carrying charges, as the commission considers 2934
necessary to ensure rate or price stability for consumers. If 2935
the commission's order includes such a phase-in, the order also 2936
shall provide for the creation of regulatory assets pursuant to 2937
generally accepted accounting principles, by authorizing the 2938
deferral of incurred costs equal to the amount not collected, 2939
plus carrying charges on that amount. Further, the order shall 2940
authorize the collection of those deferrals through a 2941
nonbypassable surcharge on any such rate or price so established 2942
for the electric distribution utility by the commission. 2943
Sec. 4928.149. No electric distribution utility may use 2944
any electric energy storage system to participate in the 2945
wholesale market, if the utility purchased or acquired that 2946

system for distribution service. 2947
Sec. 4928.151. The public utilities commission shall adopt 2948
and enforce rules prescribing a uniform, statewide policy 2949
regarding electric transmission and distribution line extensions 2950
and requisite substations and related facilities that are 2951
requested by nonresidential customers of electric utilities, so 2952
that, on and after the effective date of the initial rules so 2953
adopted, all such utilities apply the same policies and charges 2954
to those customers. Initial rules shall be adopted not later 2955
than six months after the effective date of this section. The 2956
rules shall address the just and reasonable allocation to and 2957
utility recovery from the requesting customer or other customers 2958
of the utility of all costs of any such line extension and any 2959
requisite substation or related facility, including, but not 2960
limited to, the costs of necessary technical studies, operations 2961
and maintenance costs, and capital costs, including a return on 2962
capital costs. The rules shall also include the following: 2963
(A) Require nonresidential customers to be responsible for 2964
the actual cost of necessary technical studies regarding the 2965
customer's requested transmission and distribution line 2966
extensions; 2967
(B) Require the utility to give nonresidential customers 2968
taking service at greater than thirty-four thousand volts the 2969
option to self-build any such transmission and distribution line 2970
extensions and related facilities that are dedicated to the 2971
nonresidential customer's new service. Related facilities may 2972
include any requisite substation, switching station, breaker 2973
station, or other related system upgrades. If the nonresidential 2974
customer elects to self-build, the customer is responsible for 2975
one hundred per cent of the costs and shall build the system to 2976

the utility's published engineering and construction standards 2977
using contractors that have been approved by the utility. Such 2978
standards are subject to approval by the public utilities 2979
commission, and the utility shall publish such standards and 2980
approved contractors on a public web site. A nonresidential 2981
customer who elects to self-build the line extension and related 2982
facilities shall transfer ownership and operation of the 2983
facilities to the utility to own, operate, and maintain the 2984
facility. 2985
(C) Require nonresidential customers that take service at 2986
greater than thirty-four thousand volts and do not elect to 2987
self-build to provide credit support or reimbursement to the 2988
utility for one hundred per cent of the utility's costs of any 2989
such line extension and any requisite substations and related 2990
facilities, including the costs of necessary technical studies, 2991
operations and maintenance costs, and capital costs, including a 2992
return on capital costs. 2993
Sec. 4928.17. (A) Except as otherwise provided in sections 2994
4928.141 or 4928.142 or 4928.143 or 4928.31 to 4928.40 of the 2995
Revised Code and beginning on the starting date of competitive 2996
retail electric service, no electric utility shall engage in 2997
this state, either directly or through an affiliate, in the 2998
businesses of supplying a noncompetitive retail electric service 2999
and supplying a competitive retail electric service, or in the 3000
businesses of supplying a noncompetitive retail electric service 3001
and supplying a product or service other than retail electric 3002
service, unless the utility implements and operates under a 3003
corporate separation plan that is approved by the public 3004
utilities commission under this section, is consistent with the 3005
policy specified in section 4928.02 of the Revised Code, and 3006
achieves all of the following: 3007

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 104
As Passed by the House
(1) The plan provides, at minimum, for the provision of 3008
the competitive retail electric service or the nonelectric 3009
product or service through a fully separated affiliate of the 3010
utility, and the plan includes separate accounting requirements, 3011
the code of conduct as ordered by the commission pursuant to a 3012
rule it shall adopt under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the 3013
Revised Code, and such other measures as are necessary to 3014
effectuate the policy specified in section 4928.02 of the 3015
Revised Code. 3016
(2) The plan satisfies the public interest in preventing 3017
unfair competitive advantage and preventing the abuse of market 3018
power. 3019
(3) The plan is sufficient to ensure that the utility will 3020
not extend any undue preference or advantage to any affiliate, 3021
division, or part of its own business engaged in the business of 3022
supplying the competitive retail electric service or nonelectric 3023
product or service, including, but not limited to, utility 3024
resources such as trucks, tools, office equipment, office space, 3025
supplies, customer and marketing information, advertising, 3026
billing and mailing systems, personnel, and training, without 3027
compensation based upon fully loaded embedded costs charged to 3028
the affiliate; and to ensure that any such affiliate, division, 3029
or part will not receive undue preference or advantage from any 3030
affiliate, division, or part of the business engaged in business 3031
of supplying the noncompetitive retail electric service. No such 3032
utility, affiliate, division, or part shall extend such undue 3033
preference. Notwithstanding any other division of this section, 3034
a utility's obligation under division (A)(3) of this section 3035
shall be effective January 1, 2000. 3036
(B) The commission may approve, modify and approve, or 3037

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 105
As Passed by the House
disapprove a corporate separation plan filed with the commission 3038
under division (A) of this section. As part of the code of 3039
conduct required under division (A)(1) of this section, the 3040
commission shall adopt rules pursuant to division (A) of section 3041
4928.06 of the Revised Code regarding corporate separation and 3042
procedures for plan filing and approval. The rules shall include 3043
limitations on affiliate practices solely for the purpose of 3044
maintaining a separation of the affiliate's business from the 3045
business of the utility to prevent unfair competitive advantage 3046
abuse of market power by virtue of that relationship. The rules 3047
also shall include an opportunity for any person having a real 3048
and substantial interest in the corporate separation plan to 3049
file specific objections to the plan and propose specific 3050
responses to issues raised in the objections, which objections 3051
and responses the commission shall address in its final order. 3052
Prior to commission approval of the plan, the commission shall 3053
afford a hearing upon those aspects of the plan that the 3054
commission determines reasonably require a hearing. The 3055
commission may reject and require refiling of a substantially 3056
inadequate plan under this section. 3057
(C) The commission shall issue an order approving or 3058
modifying and approving a corporate separation plan under this 3059
section, to be effective on the date specified in the order, 3060
only upon findings that the plan reasonably complies with the 3061
requirements of division (A) of this section and will provide 3062
for ongoing compliance with the policy specified in section 3063
4928.02 of the Revised Code. However, for good cause shown, the 3064
commission may issue an order approving or modifying and 3065
approving a corporate separation plan under this section that 3066
does not comply with division (A)(1) of this section but 3067
complies with such functional separation requirements as the 3068

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 106
As Passed by the House
commission authorizes to apply for an interim period prescribed 3069
in the order, upon a finding that such alternative plan will 3070
provide for ongoing compliance with the policy specified in 3071
section 4928.02 of the Revised Code. 3072
(D) Any party may seek an amendment to a corporate 3073
separation plan approved under this section, and the commission, 3074
pursuant to a request from any party or on its own initiative, 3075
may order as it considers necessary the filing of an amended 3076
corporate separation plan to reflect changed circumstances. 3077
(E) No electric distribution utility shall sell or 3078
transfer any generating asset it wholly or partly owns at any 3079
time without obtaining prior commission approval. 3080
Sec. 4928.20. (A) The legislative authority of a municipal 3081
corporation may adopt an ordinance, or the board of township 3082
trustees of a township or the board of county commissioners of a 3083
county may adopt a resolution, under which, on or after the 3084
starting date of competitive retail electric service, it may 3085
aggregate in accordance with this section the retail electrical 3086
loads located, respectively, within the municipal corporation, 3087
township, or unincorporated area of the county and, for that 3088
purpose, may enter into service agreements to facilitate for 3089
those loads the sale and purchase of electricity. The 3090
legislative authority or board also may exercise such authority 3091
jointly with any other such legislative authority or board. For 3092
customers that are not mercantile customers, an ordinance or 3093
resolution under this division shall specify whether the 3094
aggregation will occur only with the prior, affirmative consent 3095
of each person owning, occupying, controlling, or using an 3096
electric load center proposed to be aggregated or will occur 3097
automatically for all such persons pursuant to the opt-out 3098

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 107
As Passed by the House
requirements of division (D) of this section. The aggregation of 3099
mercantile customers shall occur only with the prior, 3100
affirmative consent of each such person owning, occupying, 3101
controlling, or using an electric load center proposed to be 3102
aggregated. Nothing in this division, however, authorizes the 3103
aggregation of the retail electric loads of an electric load 3104
center, as defined in section 4933.81 of the Revised Code, that 3105
is located in the certified territory of a nonprofit electric 3106
supplier under sections 4933.81 to 4933.90 of the Revised Code 3107
or an electric load center served by transmission or 3108
distribution facilities of a municipal electric utility. 3109
(B) If an ordinance or resolution adopted under division 3110
(A) of this section specifies that aggregation of customers that 3111
are not mercantile customers will occur automatically as 3112
described in that division, the ordinance or resolution shall 3113
direct the board of elections to submit the question of the 3114
authority to aggregate to the electors of the respective 3115
municipal corporation, township, or unincorporated area of a 3116
county at a special election on the day of the next primary or 3117
general election in the municipal corporation, township, or 3118
county. The legislative authority or board shall certify a copy 3119
of the ordinance or resolution to the board of elections not 3120
less than ninety days before the day of the special election. No 3121
ordinance or resolution adopted under division (A) of this 3122
section that provides for an election under this division shall 3123
take effect unless approved by a majority of the electors voting 3124
upon the ordinance or resolution at the election held pursuant 3125
to this division. 3126
(C) Upon the applicable requisite authority under 3127
divisions (A) and (B) of this section, the legislative authority 3128
or board shall develop a plan of operation and governance for 3129

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 108
As Passed by the House
the aggregation program so authorized. Before adopting a plan 3130
under this division, the legislative authority or board shall 3131
hold at least two public hearings on the plan. Before the first 3132
hearing, the legislative authority or board shall publish notice 3133
of the hearings once a week for two consecutive weeks in a 3134
newspaper of general circulation in the jurisdiction or as 3135
provided in section 7.16 of the Revised Code. The notice shall 3136
summarize the plan and state the date, time, and location of 3137
each hearing. 3138
(D) No legislative authority or board, pursuant to an 3139
ordinance or resolution under divisions (A) and (B) of this 3140
section that provides for automatic aggregation of customers 3141
that are not mercantile customers as described in division (A) 3142
of this section, shall aggregate the electrical load of any 3143
electric load center located within its jurisdiction unless it 3144
in advance clearly discloses to the person owning, occupying, 3145
controlling, or using the load center that the person will be 3146
enrolled automatically in the aggregation program and will 3147
remain so enrolled unless the person affirmatively elects by a 3148
stated procedure not to be so enrolled. The disclosure shall 3149
state prominently the rates, charges, and other terms and 3150
conditions of enrollment. The stated procedure shall allow any 3151
person enrolled in the aggregation program the opportunity to 3152
opt out of the program every three years, without paying a 3153
switching fee. Any such person that opts out before the 3154
commencement of the aggregation program pursuant to the stated 3155
procedure shall default to the standard service offer provided 3156
under section 4928.14 or division (D) of section 4928.35 of the 3157
Revised Code until the person chooses an alternative supplier. 3158
(E)(1) With respect to a governmental aggregation for a 3159
municipal corporation that is authorized pursuant to divisions 3160

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 109
As Passed by the House
(A) to (D) of this section, resolutions may be proposed by 3161
initiative or referendum petitions in accordance with sections 3162
731.28 to 731.41 of the Revised Code. 3163
(2) With respect to a governmental aggregation for a 3164
township or the unincorporated area of a county, which 3165
aggregation is authorized pursuant to divisions (A) to (D) of 3166
this section, resolutions may be proposed by initiative or 3167
referendum petitions in accordance with sections 731.28 to 3168
731.40 of the Revised Code, except that: 3169
(a) The petitions shall be filed, respectively, with the 3170
township fiscal officer or the board of county commissioners, 3171
who shall perform those duties imposed under those sections upon 3172
the city auditor or village clerk. 3173
(b) The petitions shall contain the signatures of not less 3174
than ten per cent of the total number of electors in, 3175
respectively, the township or the unincorporated area of the 3176
county who voted for the office of governor at the preceding 3177
general election for that office in that area. 3178
(F) A governmental aggregator under division (A) of this 3179
section is not a public utility engaging in the wholesale 3180
purchase and resale of electricity, and provision of the 3181
aggregated service is not a wholesale utility transaction. A 3182
governmental aggregator shall be subject to supervision and 3183
regulation by the public utilities commission only to the extent 3184
of any competitive retail electric service it provides and 3185
commission authority under this chapter. 3186
(G) This section does not apply in the case of a municipal 3187
corporation that supplies such aggregated service to electric 3188
load centers to which its municipal electric utility also 3189

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 110
As Passed by the House
supplies a noncompetitive retail electric service through 3190
transmission or distribution facilities the utility singly or 3191
jointly owns or operates. 3192
(H) A governmental aggregator shall not include in its 3193
aggregation the accounts of any of the following: 3194
(1) A customer that has opted out of the aggregation; 3195
(2) A customer in contract with a certified electric 3196
services company; 3197
(3) A customer that has a special contract with an 3198
electric distribution utility; 3199
(4) A customer that is not located within the governmental 3200
aggregator's governmental boundaries; 3201
(5) Subject to division (C) of section 4928.21 of the 3202
Revised Code, a customer who appears on the "do not aggregate" 3203
list maintained under that section. 3204
(I) Customers that are part of a governmental aggregation 3205
under this section shall be responsible only for such portion of 3206
a surcharge under section 4928.144 of the Revised Code that is 3207
proportionate to the benefits, as determined by the commission, 3208
that electric load centers within the jurisdiction of the 3209
governmental aggregation as a group receive. The proportionate 3210
surcharge so established shall apply to each customer of the 3211
governmental aggregation while the customer is part of that 3212
aggregation. If a customer ceases being such a customer, the 3213
otherwise applicable surcharge shall apply. Nothing in this 3214
section shall result in less than full recovery by an electric 3215
distribution utility of any surcharge authorized under section 3216
4928.144 of the Revised Code. Nothing in this section shall 3217
result in less than the full and timely imposition, charging, 3218

collection, and adjustment by an electric distribution utility, 3219
its assignee, or any collection agent, of the phase-in-recovery 3220
charges authorized pursuant to a final financing order issued 3221
pursuant to sections 4928.23 to 4928.2318 of the Revised Code. 3222
(J) On behalf of the customers that are part of a 3223
governmental aggregation under this section and by filing 3224
written notice with the public utilities commission, the 3225
legislative authority that formed or is forming that 3226
governmental aggregation may elect not to receive standby 3227
service within the meaning of division (B)(2)(d) of section 3228
4928.143 of the Revised Code from an electric distribution 3229
utility in whose certified territory the governmental 3230
aggregation is located and that operates under an approved 3231
electric security plan under that section. Upon the filing of 3232
that notice, the electric distribution utility shall not charge 3233
any such customer to whom competitive retail electric generation 3234
service is provided by another supplier under the governmental 3235
aggregation for the standby service. Any such consumer that 3236
returns to the utility for competitive retail electric service 3237
shall pay the market price of power incurred by the utility to 3238
serve that consumer plus any amount attributable to the 3239
utility's cost of compliance with the renewable energy resource 3240
provisions of section 4928.64 of the Revised Code to serve the 3241
consumer. Such market price shall include, but not be limited 3242
to, capacity and energy charges; all charges associated with the 3243
provision of that power supply through the regional transmission 3244
organization, including, but not limited to, transmission, 3245
ancillary services, congestion, and settlement and 3246
administrative charges; and all other costs incurred by the 3247
utility that are associated with the procurement, provision, and 3248
administration of that power supply, as such costs may be 3249

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 112
As Passed by the House
approved by the commission. The period of time during which the 3250
market price and renewable energy resource amount shall be so 3251
assessed on the consumer shall be from the time the consumer so 3252
returns to the electric distribution utility until the 3253
expiration of the electric security plan. However, if that 3254
period of time is expected to be more than two years, the 3255
commission may reduce the time period to a period of not less 3256
than two years. 3257
(K) The commission shall adopt rules and issue orders in 3258
proceedings under sections 4928.141 and 4928.142 of the Revised 3259
Code to encourage and promote large-scale governmental 3260
aggregation in this state. For that purpose, the commission 3261
shall conduct an immediate review of any rules it has adopted 3262
for the purpose of this section that are in effect on the 3263
effective date of the amendment of this section by S.B. 221 of 3264
the 127th general assembly, July 31, 2008. Further, within the 3265
context of an electric security plan under section 4928.143 of 3266
the Revised Code, the The commission shall consider the effect 3267
on large-scale governmental aggregation of any nonbypassable 3268
generation charges, however collected, that would be established 3269
under that plan, except any nonbypassable generation charges 3270
that relate to any cost incurred by the review each application 3271
filed under section 4928.142 of the Revised Code by an electric 3272
distribution utility, to ensure that the deferral of which has 3273
been authorized by the commission prior to the effective date of 3274
application and the amendment of this section by S.B. 221 of the 3275
127th general assembly, July 31, 2008 resulting market rate 3276
offer shall not contain any rate, price, term, condition, or 3277
provision that would have an adverse effect on large-scale 3278
governmental aggregation in this state. 3279

Code. 3484
(B) When reviewing an application for a financing order 3485
pursuant to sections 4928.23 to 4928.2318 of the Revised Code, 3486
the commission may hold such hearings, make such inquiries or 3487
investigations, and examine such witnesses, books, papers, 3488
documents, and contracts as the commission considers proper to 3489
carry out these sections. Within thirty days after the filing of 3490
an application under section 4928.231 of the Revised Code, the 3491
commission shall publish a schedule of the proceeding. 3492
(C)(1) Not later than one hundred thirty-five days after 3493
the date the application is filed, the commission shall issue 3494
either a financing order, granting the application in whole or 3495
with modifications, or an order suspending or rejecting the 3496

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 121
As Passed by the House
of this section if, at the time the financing order is issued, 3513
the commission finds that the issuance of the phase-in-recovery 3514
bonds and the phase-in-recovery charges authorized by the order 3515
results in, consistent with market conditions, both measurably 3516
enhancing cost savings to customers and mitigating rate impacts 3517
to customers as compared with traditional financing mechanisms 3518
or traditional cost-recovery methods available to the electric 3519
distribution utility or, if the commission previously approved a 3520
recovery method, as compared with that recovery method. 3521
(E) The commission shall include all of the following in a 3522
financing order issued under division (C) of this section: 3523

appropriate to ensure the full and timely imposition, charging, 3544
collection, and adjustment, pursuant to an approved adjustment 3545
mechanism, of the phase-in-recovery charges described in 3546
divisions (E)(3) to (5) of this section. 3547
(F) The commission may, in a financing order, afford the 3548
electric distribution utility flexibility in establishing the 3549
terms and conditions for the phase-in-recovery bonds to 3550
accommodate changes in market conditions, including repayment 3551
schedules, interest rates, financing costs, collateral 3552
requirements, required debt service and other reserves, and the 3553
ability of the electric distribution utility, at its option, to 3554
effect a series of issuances of phase-in-recovery bonds and 3555
correlated assignments, sales, pledges, or other transfers of 3556
phase-in-recovery property. Any changes made under this section 3557
to terms and conditions for the phase-in-recovery bonds shall be 3558
in conformance with the financing order. 3559
(G) A financing order may provide that the creation of 3560
phase-in-recovery property shall be simultaneous with the sale 3561
of that property to an assignee as provided in the application 3562
and the pledge of the property to secure phase-in-recovery 3563
bonds. 3564
(H) The commission shall, in a financing order, require 3565
that after the final terms of each issuance of phase-in-recovery 3566
bonds have been established, and prior to the issuance of those 3567
bonds, the electric distribution utility shall determine the 3568
resulting phase-in-recovery charges in accordance with the 3569
adjustment mechanism described in the financing order. These 3570
phase-in-recovery charges shall be final and effective upon the 3571

issuance of the phase-in-recovery bonds, without further 3572
commission action. 3573
Sec. 4928.34. (A) The public utilities commission shall 3574
not approve or prescribe a transition plan under division (A) or 3575
(B) of section 4928.33 of the Revised Code unless the commission 3576
first makes all of the following determinations: 3577
(1) The unbundled components for the electric transmission 3578
component of retail electric service, as specified in the 3579
utility's rate unbundling plan required by division (A)(1) of 3580
section 4928.31 of the Revised Code, equal the tariff rates 3581
determined by the federal energy regulatory commission that are 3582
in effect on the date of the approval of the transition plan 3583
under sections 4928.31 to 4928.40 of the Revised Code, as each 3584
such rate is determined applicable to each particular customer 3585
class and rate schedule by the commission. The unbundled 3586
transmission component shall include a sliding scale of charges 3587
under division (B) of section 4905.31 of the Revised Code to 3588
ensure that refunds determined or approved by the federal energy 3589
regulatory commission are flowed through to retail electric 3590
customers. 3591
(2) The unbundled components for retail electric 3592
distribution service in the rate unbundling plan equal the 3593
difference between the costs attributable to the utility's 3594
transmission and distribution rates and charges under its 3595
schedule of rates and charges in effect on the effective date of 3596
this section, based upon the record in the most recent rate 3597
proceeding of the utility for which the utility's schedule was 3598
established, and the tariff rates for electric transmission 3599
service determined by the federal energy regulatory commission 3600
as described in division (A)(1) of this section. 3601

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 124
As Passed by the House
(3) All other unbundled components required by the 3602
commission in the rate unbundling plan equal the costs 3603
attributable to the particular service as reflected in the 3604
utility's schedule of rates and charges in effect on the 3605
effective date of this section. 3606
(4) The unbundled components for retail electric 3607
generation service in the rate unbundling plan equal the 3608
residual amount remaining after the determination of the 3609
transmission, distribution, and other unbundled components, and 3610
after any adjustments necessary to reflect the effects of the 3611
amendment of section 5727.111 of the Revised Code by Sub. S.B. 3612
No. 3 of the 123rd general assembly. 3613
(5) All unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan 3614
have been adjusted to reflect any base rate reductions on file 3615
with the commission and as scheduled to be in effect by December 3616
31, 2005, under rate settlements in effect on the effective date 3617
of this section. However, all earnings obligations, 3618
restrictions, or caps imposed on an electric utility in a 3619
commission order prior to the effective date of this section are 3620
void. 3621
(6) Subject to division (A)(5) of this section, the total 3622
of all unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan are 3623
capped and shall equal during the market development period, 3624
except as specifically provided in this chapter, the total of 3625
all rates and charges in effect under the applicable bundled 3626
schedule of the electric utility pursuant to section 4905.30 of 3627
the Revised Code in effect on the day before the effective date 3628
of this section, including the transition charge determined 3629
under section 4928.40 of the Revised Code, adjusted for any 3630
changes in the taxation of electric utilities and retail 3631

electric service under Sub. S.B. No. 3 of the 123rd General 3632
Assembly, the universal service rider authorized by section 3633
4928.51 of the Revised Code, and the temporary rider authorized 3634
by section 4928.61 of the Revised Code. For the purpose of this 3635
division, the rate cap applicable to a customer receiving 3636
electric service pursuant to an arrangement approved by the 3637
commission under section 4905.31 of the Revised Code is, for the 3638
term of the arrangement, the total of all rates and charges in 3639
effect under the arrangement. For any rate schedule filed 3640
pursuant to section 4905.30 of the Revised Code or any 3641
arrangement subject to approval pursuant to section 4905.31 of 3642
the Revised Code, the initial tax-related adjustment to the rate 3643
cap required by this division shall be equal to the rate of 3644
taxation specified in section 5727.81 of the Revised Code and 3645
applicable to the schedule or arrangement. To the extent such 3646
total annual amount of the tax-related adjustment is greater 3647
than or less than the comparable amount of the total annual tax 3648
reduction experienced by the electric utility as a result of the 3649
provisions of Sub. S.B. No. 3 of the 123rd general assembly, 3650
such difference shall be addressed by the commission through 3651
accounting procedures, refunds, or an annual surcharge or credit 3652
to customers, or through other appropriate means, to avoid 3653
placing the financial responsibility for the difference upon the 3654
electric utility or its shareholders. Any adjustments in the 3655
rate of taxation specified in section 5727.81 of the Revised 3656
Code section shall not occur without a corresponding adjustment 3657
to the rate cap for each such rate schedule or arrangement. The 3658
department of taxation shall advise the commission and self- 3659
assessors under section 5727.81 of the Revised Code prior to the 3660
effective date of any change in the rate of taxation specified 3661
under that section, and the commission shall modify the rate cap 3662
to reflect that adjustment so that the rate cap adjustment is 3663

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 126
As Passed by the House
effective as of the effective date of the change in the rate of 3664
taxation. This division shall be applied, to the extent 3665
possible, to eliminate any increase in the price of electricity 3666
for customers that otherwise may occur as a result of 3667
establishing the taxes contemplated in section 5727.81 of the 3668
Revised Code. 3669
(7) The rate unbundling plan complies with any rules 3670
adopted by the commission under division (A) of section 4928.06 3671
of the Revised Code. 3672
(8) The corporate separation plan required by division (A) 3673
(2) of section 4928.31 of the Revised Code complies with section 3674
4928.17 of the Revised Code and any rules adopted by the 3675
commission under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the Revised 3676
Code. 3677
(9) Any plan or plans the commission requires to address 3678
operational support systems and any other technical 3679
implementation issues pertaining to competitive retail electric 3680
service comply with any rules adopted by the commission under 3681
division (A) of section 4928.06 of the Revised Code. 3682
(10) The employee assistance plan required by division (A) 3683
(4) of section 4928.31 of the Revised Code sufficiently provides 3684
severance, retraining, early retirement, retention, 3685
outplacement, and other assistance for the utility's employees 3686
whose employment is affected by electric industry restructuring 3687
under this chapter. 3688
(11) The consumer education plan required under division 3689
(A)(5) of section 4928.31 of the Revised Code complies with 3690
former section 4928.42 of the Revised Code and any rules adopted 3691
by the commission under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the 3692

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 127
As Passed by the House
Revised Code. 3693
(12) The transition revenues for which an electric utility 3694
is authorized a revenue opportunity under sections 4928.31 to 3695
4928.40 of the Revised Code are the allowable transition costs 3696
of the utility as such costs are determined by the commission 3697
pursuant to section 4928.39 of the Revised Code, and the 3698
transition charges for the customer classes and rate schedules 3699
of the utility are the charges determined pursuant to section 3700
4928.40 of the Revised Code. 3701
(13) Any independent transmission plan included in the 3702
transition plan filed under section 4928.31 of the Revised Code 3703
reasonably complies with section 4928.12 of the Revised Code and 3704
any rules adopted by the commission under division (A) of 3705
section 4928.06 of the Revised Code, unless the commission, for 3706
good cause shown, authorizes the utility to defer compliance 3707
until an order is issued under division (G) of section 4928.35 3708
of the Revised Code. 3709
(14) The utility is in compliance with sections 4928.01 to 3710
4928.11 of the Revised Code and any rules or orders of the 3711
commission adopted or issued under those sections. 3712
(15) All unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan 3713
have been adjusted to reflect the elimination of the tax on 3714
gross receipts imposed by section 5727.30 of the Revised Code. 3715
In addition, a transition plan approved by the commission 3716
under section 4928.33 of the Revised Code but not containing an 3717
approved independent transmission plan shall contain the express 3718
conditions that the utility will comply with an order issued 3719
under division (G) of section 4928.35 of the Revised Code. 3720
(B) Subject to division (E) of section 4928.17 of the 3721

Revised Code, if If the commission finds that any part of the 3722
transition plan would constitute an abandonment under sections 3723
4905.20 and 4905.21 of the Revised Code, the commission shall 3724
not approve that part of the transition plan unless it makes the 3725
finding required for approval of an abandonment application 3726
under section 4905.21 of the Revised Code. Sections 4905.20 and 3727
4905.21 of the Revised Code otherwise shall not apply to a 3728

contract, a portion of the electricity supply required for its 3780
standard service offer under section sections 4928.141 and 3781
4928.142 of the Revised Code, and an electric services company 3782
shall have provided a portion of its electricity supply for 3783
retail consumers in this state from qualifying renewable energy 3784
resources, including, at its discretion, qualifying renewable 3785
energy resources obtained pursuant to an electricity supply 3786
contract. That portion shall equal eight and one-half per cent 3787
of the total number of kilowatt hours of electricity sold by the 3788
subject utility or company to any and all retail electric 3789
consumers whose electric load centers are served by that utility 3790
and are located within the utility's certified territory or, in 3791
the case of an electric services company, are served by the 3792
company and are located within this state. However, nothing in 3793
this section precludes a utility or company from providing a 3794
greater percentage. 3795

(C)(1) The commission annually shall review an electric 3806
distribution utility's or electric services company's compliance 3807
with the most recent applicable benchmark under division (B)(2) 3808
of this section and, in the course of that review, shall 3809
identify any undercompliance or noncompliance of the utility or 3810
company that it determines is weather-related, related to 3811
equipment or resource shortages for qualifying renewable energy 3812
resources as applicable, or is otherwise outside the utility's 3813
or company's control. 3814
(2) Subject to the cost cap provisions of division (C)(3) 3815
of this section, if the commission determines, after notice and 3816
opportunity for hearing, and based upon its findings in that 3817
review regarding avoidable undercompliance or noncompliance, but 3818
subject to division (C)(4) of this section, that the utility or 3819
company has failed to comply with any such benchmark, the 3820
commission shall impose a renewable energy compliance payment on 3821
the utility or company. 3822
(a) The compliance payment pertaining to the solar energy 3823
resource benchmarks under division (B)(2) of this section shall 3824
be an amount per megawatt hour of undercompliance or 3825
noncompliance in the period under review, as follows: 3826
(i) Three hundred dollars for 2014, 2015, and 2016; 3827
(ii) Two hundred fifty dollars for 2017 and 2018; 3828
(iii) Two hundred dollars for 2019. 3829
(b) The compliance payment pertaining to the renewable 3830
energy resource benchmarks under division (B)(2) of this section 3831
shall equal the number of additional renewable energy credits 3832
that the electric distribution utility or electric services 3833
company would have needed to comply with the applicable 3834

benchmark in the period under review times an amount that shall 3835
begin at forty-five dollars and shall be adjusted annually by 3836
the commission to reflect any change in the consumer price index 3837
as defined in section 101.27 of the Revised Code, but shall not 3838
be less than forty-five dollars. As used in this division, 3839
"consumer price index" means the consumer price index prepared 3840
by the United States bureau of labor statistics (U.S. city 3841
average for urban wage earners and clerical workers: all items, 3842
1982-1984=100), or, if that index is no longer published, a 3843
generally available comparable index. 3844
(c) The compliance payment shall not be passed through by 3845
the electric distribution utility or electric services company 3846
to consumers. The compliance payment shall be remitted to the 3847
commission, for deposit to the credit of the advanced energy 3848
fund created under section 4928.61 of the Revised Code. Payment 3849
of the compliance payment shall be subject to such collection 3850
and enforcement procedures as apply to the collection of a 3851
forfeiture under sections 4905.55 to 4905.60 and 4905.64 of the 3852
Revised Code. 3853
(3) An electric distribution utility or an electric 3854
services company need not comply with a benchmark under division 3855
(B)(2) of this section to the extent that its reasonably 3856
expected cost of that compliance exceeds its reasonably expected 3857
cost of otherwise producing or acquiring the requisite 3858
electricity by three per cent or more. The cost of compliance 3859
shall be calculated as though any exemption from taxes and 3860
assessments had not been granted under section 5727.75 of the 3861
Revised Code. 3862
(4)(a) An electric distribution utility or electric 3863
services company may request the commission to make a force 3864

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 134
As Passed by the House
majeure determination pursuant to this division regarding all or 3865
part of the utility's or company's compliance with any minimum 3866
benchmark under division (B)(2) of this section during the 3867
period of review occurring pursuant to division (C)(2) of this 3868
section. The commission may require the electric distribution 3869
utility or electric services company to make solicitations for 3870
renewable energy resource credits as part of its default service 3871
before the utility's or company's request of force majeure under 3872
this division can be made. 3873
(b) Within ninety days after the filing of a request by an 3874
electric distribution utility or electric services company under 3875
division (C)(4)(a) of this section, the commission shall 3876
determine if qualifying renewable energy resources are 3877
reasonably available in the marketplace in sufficient quantities 3878
for the utility or company to comply with the subject minimum 3879
benchmark during the review period. In making this 3880
determination, the commission shall consider whether the 3881
electric distribution utility or electric services company has 3882
made a good faith effort to acquire sufficient qualifying 3883
renewable energy or, as applicable, solar energy resources to so 3884
comply, including, but not limited to, by banking or seeking 3885
renewable energy resource credits or by seeking the resources 3886
through long-term contracts. Additionally, the commission shall 3887
consider the availability of qualifying renewable energy or 3888
solar energy resources in this state and other jurisdictions in 3889
the PJM interconnection regional transmission organization, 3890
L.L.C., or its successor and the midcontinent independent system 3891
operator or its successor. 3892
(c) If, pursuant to division (C)(4)(b) of this section, 3893
the commission determines that qualifying renewable energy or 3894
solar energy resources are not reasonably available to permit 3895

As Passed by the House
the electric distribution utility or electric services company 3896
to comply, during the period of review, with the subject minimum 3897
benchmark prescribed under division (B)(2) of this section, the 3898
commission shall modify that compliance obligation of the 3899
utility or company as it determines appropriate to accommodate 3900
the finding. Commission modification shall not automatically 3901
reduce the obligation for the electric distribution utility's or 3902
electric services company's compliance in subsequent years. If 3903
it modifies the electric distribution utility or electric 3904
services company obligation under division (C)(4)(c) of this 3905
section, the commission may require the utility or company, if 3906
sufficient renewable energy resource credits exist in the 3907
marketplace, to acquire additional renewable energy resource 3908
credits in subsequent years equivalent to the utility's or 3909
company's modified obligation under division (C)(4)(c) of this 3910
section. 3911
(5) The commission shall establish a process to provide 3912
for at least an annual review of the renewable energy resource 3913
market in this state and in the service territories of the 3914
regional transmission organizations that manage transmission 3915
systems located in this state. The commission shall use the 3916
results of this study to identify any needed changes to the 3917
amount of the renewable energy compliance payment specified 3918
under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of this section. Specifically, 3919
the commission may increase the amount to ensure that payment of 3920
compliance payments is not used to achieve compliance with this 3921
section in lieu of actually acquiring or realizing energy 3922
derived from qualifying renewable energy resources. However, if 3923
the commission finds that the amount of the compliance payment 3924
should be otherwise changed, the commission shall present this 3925
finding to the general assembly for legislative enactment. 3926

(D) The commission annually shall submit to the general 3927
assembly in accordance with section 101.68 of the Revised Code a 3928
report describing all of the following: 3929
(1) The compliance of electric distribution utilities and 3930
electric services companies with division (B) of this section; 3931
(2) The average annual cost of renewable energy credits 3932
purchased by utilities and companies for the year covered in the 3933
report; 3934
(3) Any strategy for utility and company compliance or for 3935
encouraging the use of qualifying renewable energy resources in 3936
supplying this state's electricity needs in a manner that 3937
considers available technology, costs, job creation, and 3938
economic impacts. 3939
The commission shall begin providing the information 3940
described in division (D)(2) of this section in each report 3941
submitted after September 10, 2012. The commission shall allow 3942
and consider public comments on the report prior to its 3943
submission to the general assembly. Nothing in the report shall 3944
be binding on any person, including any utility or company for 3945
the purpose of its compliance with any benchmark under division 3946
(B) of this section, or the enforcement of that provision under 3947
division (C) of this section. 3948
(E) All costs incurred by an electric distribution utility 3949
in complying with the requirements of this section shall be 3950
bypassable by any consumer that has exercised choice of supplier 3951
under section 4928.03 of the Revised Code. 3952
Sec. 4928.645. (A) An electric distribution utility or 3953
electric services company may use, for the purpose of complying 3954

4928.64 of the Revised Code, renewable energy credits any time 3956
in the five calendar years following the date of their purchase 3957
or acquisition from any entity, including, but not limited to, 3958
the following: 3959
(1) A mercantile customer; 3960
(2) An owner or operator of a hydroelectric generating 3961
facility that is located at a dam on a river, or on any water 3962
discharged to a river, that is within or bordering this state or 3963
within or bordering an adjoining state, or that produces power 3964
that can be shown to be deliverable into this state; 3965
(3) A seller of compressed natural gas that has been 3966
produced from biologically derived methane gas, provided that 3967
the seller may only provide renewable energy credits for metered 3968
amounts of gas. 3969
(B)(1) The public utilities commission shall adopt rules 3970
specifying that one unit of credit shall equal one megawatt hour 3971
of electricity derived from renewable energy resources, except 3972
that, for a generating facility of seventy-five megawatts or 3973
greater that is situated within this state and has committed by 3974
December 31, 2009, to modify or retrofit its generating unit or 3975
units to enable the facility to generate principally from 3976
biomass energy by June 30, 2013, each megawatt hour of 3977
electricity generated principally from that biomass energy shall 3978
equal, in units of credit, the product obtained by multiplying 3979
the actual percentage of biomass feedstock heat input used to 3980
generate such megawatt hour by the quotient obtained by dividing 3981
the then existing unit dollar amount used to determine a 3982
renewable energy compliance payment as provided under division 3983
(C)(2)(b) of section 4928.64 of the Revised Code by the then 3984
existing market value of one renewable energy credit, but such 3985

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 138
As Passed by the House
megawatt hour shall not equal less than one unit of credit. 3986
Renewable energy resources do not have to be converted to 3987
electricity in order to be eligible to receive renewable energy 3988
credits. The rules shall specify that, for purposes of 3989
converting the quantity of energy derived from biologically 3990
derived methane gas to an electricity equivalent, one megawatt 3991
hour equals 3,412,142 British thermal units. 3992
(2) The rules also shall provide for this state a system 3993
of registering renewable energy credits by specifying which of 3994
any generally available registries shall be used for that 3995
purpose and not by creating a registry. That selected system of 3996
registering renewable energy credits shall allow a hydroelectric 3997
generating facility to be eligible for obtaining renewable 3998
energy credits and shall allow customer-sited projects or 3999
actions the broadest opportunities to be eligible for obtaining 4000
renewable energy credits. 4001
(C) Beginning January 1, 2020, a qualifying solar resource 4002
as defined in section 3706.40 of the Revised Code is not 4003
eligible to obtain a renewable energy credit under this section 4004
for any megawatt hour for which the resource has been issued a 4005
solar energy credit under section 3706.45 of the Revised Code. 4006
(D) Except for compressed natural gas that has been 4007
produced from biologically derived methane gas, energy generated 4008
by using natural gas as a resource is not eligible to obtain a 4009
renewable energy credit under this section. 4010
Sec. 4928.73. (A) As used in this section : 4011

energy project is located has adopted a resolution under 5436
division (E)(1)(b) or (c) of this section to approve the 5437
application submitted under division (E) of this section to 5438
exempt the property located in that county from taxation. A 5439
board's adoption of a resolution rejecting the application or 5440
its failure to adopt a resolution approving the application does 5441
not affect the tax-exempt status of the qualified energy 5442
project's property that is located in another county. 5443
(3) The certification for the qualified energy project 5444
issued under division (E)(2) of this section has not been 5445
revoked. An energy project for which certification has been 5446
revoked is ineligible for exemption under this section. 5447
Revocation does not affect the tax-exempt status of the 5448
