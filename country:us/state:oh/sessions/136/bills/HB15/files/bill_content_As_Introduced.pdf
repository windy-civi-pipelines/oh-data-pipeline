shall select the least-cost bid winner or winners of that 868
process, and such selected bid or bids, as prescribed as retail 869
rates by the commission, shall be the electric distribution 870
utility's standard service offer unless the commission, by order 871
issued before the third calendar day following the conclusion of 872
the competitive bidding process for the market rate offer, 873
determines that one or more of the following criteria were not 874
met: 875
(1) Each portion of the bidding process was 876
oversubscribed, such that the amount of supply bid upon was 877
greater than the amount of the load bid out. 878
(2) There were four or more bidders. 879
(3) At least twenty-five per cent of the load is bid upon 880
by one or more persons other than the electric distribution 881
utility. 882
All costs incurred by the electric distribution utility as 883
a result of or related to the competitive bidding process or to 884
procuring generation service to provide the standard service 885
offer, including the costs of energy and capacity and the costs 886
of all other products and services procured as a result of the 887
competitive bidding process, shall be timely recovered through 888
the standard service offer price, and, for that purpose, the 889
commission shall approve a reconciliation mechanism, other 890
recovery mechanism, or a combination of such mechanisms for the 891
utility. 892
(D) The first application filed under this section by an 893
electric distribution utility that, as of July 31, 2008, 894
directly owns, in whole or in part, operating electric 895
generating facilities that had been used and useful in this 896

H. B. No. 15 Page 32
As Introduced
state shall require that a portion of that the utility's 897
standard service offer load for the first five years of the 898
market rate offer be competitively bid under division (A) of 899
this section as follows: ten per cent of the load in year one, 900
not more than twenty per cent in year two, thirty per cent in 901
year three, forty per cent in year four, and fifty per cent in 902
year five. Consistent with those percentages, the commission 903
shall determine the actual percentages for each year of years 904
one through five. The standard service offer price for retail 905
electric generation service under this first application shall 906
be a proportionate blend of the bid price and the generation 907
service price for the remaining standard service offer load, 908
which latter price shall be equal to the electric distribution 909
utility's most recent standard service offer price, adjusted 910
upward or downward as the commission determines reasonable, 911
relative to the jurisdictional portion of any known and 912
measurable changes from the level of any one or more of the 913
following costs as reflected in that most recent standard 914
service offer price: 915
(1) The electric distribution utility's prudently incurred 916
cost of fuel used to produce electricity; 917
(2) Its prudently incurred purchased power costs; 918
(3) Its prudently incurred costs of satisfying the supply 919
and demand portfolio requirements of this state, including, but 920
not limited to, renewable energy resource and energy efficiency 921
requirements; 922
(4) Its costs prudently incurred to comply with 923
environmental laws and regulations, with consideration of the 924
derating of any facility associated with those costs. 925

H. B. No. 15 Page 33
As Introduced
In making any adjustment to the most recent standard 926
service offer price on the basis of costs described in division 927
(D) of this section, the commission shall include the benefits 928
that may become available to the electric distribution utility 929
as a result of or in connection with the costs included in the 930
adjustment, including, but not limited to, the utility's receipt 931
of emissions credits or its receipt of tax benefits or of other 932
benefits, and, accordingly, the commission may impose such 933
conditions on the adjustment to ensure that any such benefits 934
are properly aligned with the associated cost responsibility. 935
The commission shall also determine how such adjustments will 936
affect the electric distribution utility's return on common 937
equity that may be achieved by those adjustments. The commission 938
shall not apply its consideration of the return on common equity 939
to reduce any adjustments authorized under this division unless 940
the adjustments will cause the electric distribution utility to 941
earn a return on common equity that is significantly in excess 942
of the return on common equity that is earned by publicly traded 943
companies, including utilities, that face comparable business 944
and financial risk, with such adjustments for capital structure 945
as may be appropriate. The burden of proof for demonstrating 946
that significantly excessive earnings will not occur shall be on 947
the electric distribution utility. 948
Additionally, the commission may adjust the electric 949
distribution utility's most recent standard service offer price 950
by such just and reasonable amount that the commission 951
determines necessary to address any emergency that threatens the 952
utility's financial integrity or to ensure that the resulting 953
revenue available to the utility for providing the standard 954
service offer is not so inadequate as to result, directly or 955
indirectly, in a taking of property without compensation 956

H. B. No. 15 Page 34
As Introduced
pursuant to Section 19 of Article I, Ohio Constitution. The 957
electric distribution utility has the burden of demonstrating 958
that any adjustment to its most recent standard service offer 959
price is proper in accordance with this division. 960
(E) Beginning in the second year of a blended price under 961
division (D) of this section and notwithstanding any other 962
requirement of this section, the commission may alter 963
prospectively the proportions specified in that division to 964
mitigate any effect of an abrupt or significant change in the 965
electric distribution utility's standard service offer price 966
that would otherwise result in general or with respect to any 967
rate group or rate schedule but for such alteration. Any such 968
alteration shall be made not more often than annually, and the 969
commission shall not, by altering those proportions and in any 970
event, including because of the length of time, as authorized 971
under division (C) of this section, taken to approve the market 972
rate offer, cause the duration of the blending period to exceed 973
ten years as counted from the effective date of the approved 974
market rate offer. Additionally, any such alteration shall be 975
limited to an alteration affecting the prospective proportions 976
used during the blending period and shall not affect any 977
blending proportion previously approved and applied by the 978
commission under this division. 979
(F) An electric distribution utility that has received 980
commission approval of its first application under division (C) 981
of this section shall not, nor ever shall be authorized or 982
required by the commission to, file an application under section 983
4928.143 of the Revised Code. 984
Sec. 4928.144. The public utilities commission by order 985
may authorize any just and reasonable phase-in of any electric 986

As Introduced
distribution utility rate or price established under sections 987
4928.141 to 4928.143 and 4928.142 of the Revised Code, and 988
inclusive of carrying charges, as the commission considers 989
necessary to ensure rate or price stability for consumers. If 990
the commission's order includes such a phase-in, the order also 991
shall provide for the creation of regulatory assets pursuant to 992
generally accepted accounting principles, by authorizing the 993
deferral of incurred costs equal to the amount not collected, 994
plus carrying charges on that amount. Further, the order shall 995
authorize the collection of those deferrals through a 996
nonbypassable surcharge on any such rate or price so established 997
for the electric distribution utility by the commission. 998
Sec. 4928.149. No electric distribution utility may use 999
any electric energy storage system to participate in the 1000
wholesale market, if the utility purchased or acquired that 1001
system for distribution service. 1002
Sec. 4928.17. (A) Except as otherwise provided in sections 1003
4928.141 or 4928.142 or 4928.143 or 4928.31 to 4928.40 of the 1004
Revised Code and beginning on the starting date of competitive 1005
retail electric service, no electric utility shall engage in 1006
this state, either directly or through an affiliate, in the 1007
businesses of supplying a noncompetitive retail electric service 1008
and supplying a competitive retail electric service, or in the 1009
businesses of supplying a noncompetitive retail electric service 1010
and supplying a product or service other than retail electric 1011
service, unless the utility implements and operates under a 1012
corporate separation plan that is approved by the public 1013
utilities commission under this section, is consistent with the 1014
policy specified in section 4928.02 of the Revised Code, and 1015
achieves all of the following: 1016

H. B. No. 15 Page 36
As Introduced
(1) The plan provides, at minimum, for the provision of 1017
the competitive retail electric service or the nonelectric 1018
product or service through a fully separated affiliate of the 1019
utility, and the plan includes separate accounting requirements, 1020
the code of conduct as ordered by the commission pursuant to a 1021
rule it shall adopt under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the 1022
Revised Code, and such other measures as are necessary to 1023
effectuate the policy specified in section 4928.02 of the 1024
Revised Code. 1025
(2) The plan satisfies the public interest in preventing 1026
unfair competitive advantage and preventing the abuse of market 1027
power. 1028
(3) The plan is sufficient to ensure that the utility will 1029
not extend any undue preference or advantage to any affiliate, 1030
division, or part of its own business engaged in the business of 1031
supplying the competitive retail electric service or nonelectric 1032
product or service, including, but not limited to, utility 1033
resources such as trucks, tools, office equipment, office space, 1034
supplies, customer and marketing information, advertising, 1035
billing and mailing systems, personnel, and training, without 1036
compensation based upon fully loaded embedded costs charged to 1037
the affiliate; and to ensure that any such affiliate, division, 1038
or part will not receive undue preference or advantage from any 1039
affiliate, division, or part of the business engaged in business 1040
of supplying the noncompetitive retail electric service. No such 1041
utility, affiliate, division, or part shall extend such undue 1042
preference. Notwithstanding any other division of this section, 1043
a utility's obligation under division (A)(3) of this section 1044
shall be effective January 1, 2000. 1045
(B) The commission may approve, modify and approve, or 1046

H. B. No. 15 Page 37
As Introduced
disapprove a corporate separation plan filed with the commission 1047
under division (A) of this section. As part of the code of 1048
conduct required under division (A)(1) of this section, the 1049
commission shall adopt rules pursuant to division (A) of section 1050
4928.06 of the Revised Code regarding corporate separation and 1051
procedures for plan filing and approval. The rules shall include 1052
limitations on affiliate practices solely for the purpose of 1053
maintaining a separation of the affiliate's business from the 1054
business of the utility to prevent unfair competitive advantage 1055
abuse of market power by virtue of that relationship. The rules 1056
also shall include an opportunity for any person having a real 1057
and substantial interest in the corporate separation plan to 1058
file specific objections to the plan and propose specific 1059
responses to issues raised in the objections, which objections 1060
and responses the commission shall address in its final order. 1061
Prior to commission approval of the plan, the commission shall 1062
afford a hearing upon those aspects of the plan that the 1063
commission determines reasonably require a hearing. The 1064
commission may reject and require refiling of a substantially 1065
inadequate plan under this section. 1066
(C) The commission shall issue an order approving or 1067
modifying and approving a corporate separation plan under this 1068
section, to be effective on the date specified in the order, 1069
only upon findings that the plan reasonably complies with the 1070
requirements of division (A) of this section and will provide 1071
for ongoing compliance with the policy specified in section 1072
4928.02 of the Revised Code. However, for good cause shown, the 1073
commission may issue an order approving or modifying and 1074
approving a corporate separation plan under this section that 1075
does not comply with division (A)(1) of this section but 1076
complies with such functional separation requirements as the 1077

H. B. No. 15 Page 38
As Introduced
commission authorizes to apply for an interim period prescribed 1078
in the order, upon a finding that such alternative plan will 1079
provide for ongoing compliance with the policy specified in 1080
section 4928.02 of the Revised Code. 1081
(D) Any party may seek an amendment to a corporate 1082
separation plan approved under this section, and the commission, 1083
pursuant to a request from any party or on its own initiative, 1084
may order as it considers necessary the filing of an amended 1085
corporate separation plan to reflect changed circumstances. 1086
(E) No electric distribution utility shall sell or 1087
transfer any generating asset it wholly or partly owns at any 1088
time without obtaining prior commission approval. 1089
Sec. 4928.20. (A) The legislative authority of a municipal 1090
corporation may adopt an ordinance, or the board of township 1091
trustees of a township or the board of county commissioners of a 1092
county may adopt a resolution, under which, on or after the 1093
starting date of competitive retail electric service, it may 1094
aggregate in accordance with this section the retail electrical 1095
loads located, respectively, within the municipal corporation, 1096
township, or unincorporated area of the county and, for that 1097
purpose, may enter into service agreements to facilitate for 1098
those loads the sale and purchase of electricity. The 1099
legislative authority or board also may exercise such authority 1100
jointly with any other such legislative authority or board. For 1101
customers that are not mercantile customers, an ordinance or 1102
resolution under this division shall specify whether the 1103
aggregation will occur only with the prior, affirmative consent 1104
of each person owning, occupying, controlling, or using an 1105
electric load center proposed to be aggregated or will occur 1106
automatically for all such persons pursuant to the opt-out 1107

H. B. No. 15 Page 39
As Introduced
requirements of division (D) of this section. The aggregation of 1108
mercantile customers shall occur only with the prior, 1109
affirmative consent of each such person owning, occupying, 1110
controlling, or using an electric load center proposed to be 1111
aggregated. Nothing in this division, however, authorizes the 1112
aggregation of the retail electric loads of an electric load 1113
center, as defined in section 4933.81 of the Revised Code, that 1114
is located in the certified territory of a nonprofit electric 1115
supplier under sections 4933.81 to 4933.90 of the Revised Code 1116
or an electric load center served by transmission or 1117
distribution facilities of a municipal electric utility. 1118
(B) If an ordinance or resolution adopted under division 1119
(A) of this section specifies that aggregation of customers that 1120
are not mercantile customers will occur automatically as 1121
described in that division, the ordinance or resolution shall 1122
direct the board of elections to submit the question of the 1123
authority to aggregate to the electors of the respective 1124
municipal corporation, township, or unincorporated area of a 1125
county at a special election on the day of the next primary or 1126
general election in the municipal corporation, township, or 1127
county. The legislative authority or board shall certify a copy 1128
of the ordinance or resolution to the board of elections not 1129
less than ninety days before the day of the special election. No 1130
ordinance or resolution adopted under division (A) of this 1131
section that provides for an election under this division shall 1132
take effect unless approved by a majority of the electors voting 1133
upon the ordinance or resolution at the election held pursuant 1134
to this division. 1135
(C) Upon the applicable requisite authority under 1136
divisions (A) and (B) of this section, the legislative authority 1137
or board shall develop a plan of operation and governance for 1138

H. B. No. 15 Page 40
As Introduced
the aggregation program so authorized. Before adopting a plan 1139
under this division, the legislative authority or board shall 1140
hold at least two public hearings on the plan. Before the first 1141
hearing, the legislative authority or board shall publish notice 1142
of the hearings once a week for two consecutive weeks in a 1143
newspaper of general circulation in the jurisdiction or as 1144
provided in section 7.16 of the Revised Code. The notice shall 1145
summarize the plan and state the date, time, and location of 1146
each hearing. 1147
(D) No legislative authority or board, pursuant to an 1148
ordinance or resolution under divisions (A) and (B) of this 1149
section that provides for automatic aggregation of customers 1150
that are not mercantile customers as described in division (A) 1151
of this section, shall aggregate the electrical load of any 1152
electric load center located within its jurisdiction unless it 1153
in advance clearly discloses to the person owning, occupying, 1154
controlling, or using the load center that the person will be 1155
enrolled automatically in the aggregation program and will 1156
remain so enrolled unless the person affirmatively elects by a 1157
stated procedure not to be so enrolled. The disclosure shall 1158
state prominently the rates, charges, and other terms and 1159
conditions of enrollment. The stated procedure shall allow any 1160
person enrolled in the aggregation program the opportunity to 1161
opt out of the program every three years, without paying a 1162
switching fee. Any such person that opts out before the 1163
commencement of the aggregation program pursuant to the stated 1164
procedure shall default to the standard service offer provided 1165
under section 4928.14 or division (D) of section 4928.35 of the 1166
Revised Code until the person chooses an alternative supplier. 1167
(E)(1) With respect to a governmental aggregation for a 1168
municipal corporation that is authorized pursuant to divisions 1169

H. B. No. 15 Page 41
As Introduced
(A) to (D) of this section, resolutions may be proposed by 1170
initiative or referendum petitions in accordance with sections 1171
731.28 to 731.41 of the Revised Code. 1172
(2) With respect to a governmental aggregation for a 1173
township or the unincorporated area of a county, which 1174
aggregation is authorized pursuant to divisions (A) to (D) of 1175
this section, resolutions may be proposed by initiative or 1176
referendum petitions in accordance with sections 731.28 to 1177
731.40 of the Revised Code, except that: 1178
(a) The petitions shall be filed, respectively, with the 1179
township fiscal officer or the board of county commissioners, 1180
who shall perform those duties imposed under those sections upon 1181
the city auditor or village clerk. 1182
(b) The petitions shall contain the signatures of not less 1183
than ten per cent of the total number of electors in, 1184
respectively, the township or the unincorporated area of the 1185
county who voted for the office of governor at the preceding 1186
general election for that office in that area. 1187
(F) A governmental aggregator under division (A) of this 1188
section is not a public utility engaging in the wholesale 1189
purchase and resale of electricity, and provision of the 1190
aggregated service is not a wholesale utility transaction. A 1191
governmental aggregator shall be subject to supervision and 1192
regulation by the public utilities commission only to the extent 1193
of any competitive retail electric service it provides and 1194
commission authority under this chapter. 1195
(G) This section does not apply in the case of a municipal 1196
corporation that supplies such aggregated service to electric 1197
load centers to which its municipal electric utility also 1198

H. B. No. 15 Page 42
As Introduced
supplies a noncompetitive retail electric service through 1199
transmission or distribution facilities the utility singly or 1200
jointly owns or operates. 1201
(H) A governmental aggregator shall not include in its 1202
aggregation the accounts of any of the following: 1203
(1) A customer that has opted out of the aggregation; 1204
(2) A customer in contract with a certified electric 1205
services company; 1206
(3) A customer that has a special contract with an 1207
electric distribution utility; 1208
(4) A customer that is not located within the governmental 1209
aggregator's governmental boundaries; 1210
(5) Subject to division (C) of section 4928.21 of the 1211
Revised Code, a customer who appears on the "do not aggregate" 1212
list maintained under that section. 1213
(I) Customers that are part of a governmental aggregation 1214
under this section shall be responsible only for such portion of 1215
a surcharge under section 4928.144 of the Revised Code that is 1216
proportionate to the benefits, as determined by the commission, 1217
that electric load centers within the jurisdiction of the 1218
governmental aggregation as a group receive. The proportionate 1219
surcharge so established shall apply to each customer of the 1220
governmental aggregation while the customer is part of that 1221
aggregation. If a customer ceases being such a customer, the 1222
otherwise applicable surcharge shall apply. Nothing in this 1223
section shall result in less than full recovery by an electric 1224
distribution utility of any surcharge authorized under section 1225
4928.144 of the Revised Code. Nothing in this section shall 1226
result in less than the full and timely imposition, charging, 1227

H. B. No. 15 Page 43

collection, and adjustment by an electric distribution utility, 1228
its assignee, or any collection agent, of the phase-in-recovery 1229
charges authorized pursuant to a final financing order issued 1230
pursuant to sections 4928.23 to 4928.2318 of the Revised Code. 1231
(J) On behalf of the customers that are part of a 1232
governmental aggregation under this section and by filing 1233
written notice with the public utilities commission, the 1234
legislative authority that formed or is forming that 1235
governmental aggregation may elect not to receive standby 1236
service within the meaning of division (B)(2)(d) of section 1237
4928.143 of the Revised Code from an electric distribution 1238
utility in whose certified territory the governmental 1239
aggregation is located and that operates under an approved 1240
electric security plan under that section. Upon the filing of 1241
that notice, the electric distribution utility shall not charge 1242
any such customer to whom competitive retail electric generation 1243
service is provided by another supplier under the governmental 1244
aggregation for the standby service. Any such consumer that 1245
returns to the utility for competitive retail electric service 1246
shall pay the market price of power incurred by the utility to 1247
serve that consumer plus any amount attributable to the 1248
utility's cost of compliance with the renewable energy resource 1249
provisions of section 4928.64 of the Revised Code to serve the 1250
consumer. Such market price shall include, but not be limited 1251
to, capacity and energy charges; all charges associated with the 1252
provision of that power supply through the regional transmission 1253
organization, including, but not limited to, transmission, 1254
ancillary services, congestion, and settlement and 1255
administrative charges; and all other costs incurred by the 1256
utility that are associated with the procurement, provision, and 1257
administration of that power supply, as such costs may be 1258

H. B. No. 15 Page 44
As Introduced
approved by the commission. The period of time during which the 1259
market price and renewable energy resource amount shall be so 1260
assessed on the consumer shall be from the time the consumer so 1261
returns to the electric distribution utility until the 1262
expiration of the electric security plan. However, if that 1263
period of time is expected to be more than two years, the 1264
commission may reduce the time period to a period of not less 1265
than two years. 1266
(K) The commission shall adopt rules and issue orders in 1267
proceedings under sections 4928.141 and 4928.142 of the Revised 1268
Code to encourage and promote large-scale governmental 1269
aggregation in this state. For that purpose, the commission 1270
shall conduct an immediate review of any rules it has adopted 1271
for the purpose of this section that are in effect on the 1272
effective date of the amendment of this section by S.B. 221 of 1273
the 127th general assembly, July 31, 2008. Further, within the 1274
context of an electric security plan under section 4928.143 of 1275
the Revised Code, the The commission shall consider the effect 1276
on large-scale governmental aggregation of any nonbypassable 1277
generation charges, however collected, that would be established 1278
under that plan, except any nonbypassable generation charges 1279
that relate to any cost incurred by the review each application 1280
filed under section 4928.142 of the Revised Code by an electric 1281
distribution utility, to ensure that the deferral of which has 1282
been authorized by the commission prior to the effective date of 1283
application and the amendment of this section by S.B. 221 of the 1284
127th general assembly, July 31, 2008 resulting market rate 1285
offer shall not contain any rate, price, term, condition, or 1286
provision that would have an adverse effect on large-scale 1287
governmental aggregation in this state. 1288

Code. 1493
(B) When reviewing an application for a financing order 1494
pursuant to sections 4928.23 to 4928.2318 of the Revised Code, 1495
the commission may hold such hearings, make such inquiries or 1496

carry out these sections. Within thirty days after the filing of 1499
an application under section 4928.231 of the Revised Code, the 1500
commission shall publish a schedule of the proceeding. 1501
(C)(1) Not later than one hundred thirty-five days after 1502

of this section if, at the time the financing order is issued, 1522
the commission finds that the issuance of the phase-in-recovery 1523
bonds and the phase-in-recovery charges authorized by the order 1524
results in, consistent with market conditions, both measurably 1525
enhancing cost savings to customers and mitigating rate impacts 1526
to customers as compared with traditional financing mechanisms 1527

divisions (E)(3) to (5) of this section. 1556
(F) The commission may, in a financing order, afford the 1557
electric distribution utility flexibility in establishing the 1558
terms and conditions for the phase-in-recovery bonds to 1559
accommodate changes in market conditions, including repayment 1560
schedules, interest rates, financing costs, collateral 1561
requirements, required debt service and other reserves, and the 1562

Sec. 4928.34. (A) The public utilities commission shall 1583
not approve or prescribe a transition plan under division (A) or 1584
(B) of section 4928.33 of the Revised Code unless the commission 1585
first makes all of the following determinations: 1586
(1) The unbundled components for the electric transmission 1587
component of retail electric service, as specified in the 1588
utility's rate unbundling plan required by division (A)(1) of 1589
section 4928.31 of the Revised Code, equal the tariff rates 1590
determined by the federal energy regulatory commission that are 1591
in effect on the date of the approval of the transition plan 1592
under sections 4928.31 to 4928.40 of the Revised Code, as each 1593
such rate is determined applicable to each particular customer 1594
class and rate schedule by the commission. The unbundled 1595
transmission component shall include a sliding scale of charges 1596
under division (B) of section 4905.31 of the Revised Code to 1597
ensure that refunds determined or approved by the federal energy 1598
regulatory commission are flowed through to retail electric 1599
customers. 1600
(2) The unbundled components for retail electric 1601
distribution service in the rate unbundling plan equal the 1602
difference between the costs attributable to the utility's 1603
transmission and distribution rates and charges under its 1604
schedule of rates and charges in effect on the effective date of 1605
this section, based upon the record in the most recent rate 1606
proceeding of the utility for which the utility's schedule was 1607
established, and the tariff rates for electric transmission 1608
service determined by the federal energy regulatory commission 1609
as described in division (A)(1) of this section. 1610

H. B. No. 15 Page 56
As Introduced
(3) All other unbundled components required by the 1611
commission in the rate unbundling plan equal the costs 1612
attributable to the particular service as reflected in the 1613
utility's schedule of rates and charges in effect on the 1614
effective date of this section. 1615
(4) The unbundled components for retail electric 1616
generation service in the rate unbundling plan equal the 1617
residual amount remaining after the determination of the 1618
transmission, distribution, and other unbundled components, and 1619
after any adjustments necessary to reflect the effects of the 1620
amendment of section 5727.111 of the Revised Code by Sub. S.B. 1621
No. 3 of the 123rd general assembly. 1622
(5) All unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan 1623
have been adjusted to reflect any base rate reductions on file 1624
with the commission and as scheduled to be in effect by December 1625
31, 2005, under rate settlements in effect on the effective date 1626
of this section. However, all earnings obligations, 1627
restrictions, or caps imposed on an electric utility in a 1628
commission order prior to the effective date of this section are 1629
void. 1630
(6) Subject to division (A)(5) of this section, the total 1631
of all unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan are 1632
capped and shall equal during the market development period, 1633
except as specifically provided in this chapter, the total of 1634
all rates and charges in effect under the applicable bundled 1635
schedule of the electric utility pursuant to section 4905.30 of 1636
the Revised Code in effect on the day before the effective date 1637
of this section, including the transition charge determined 1638
under section 4928.40 of the Revised Code, adjusted for any 1639
changes in the taxation of electric utilities and retail 1640

electric service under Sub. S.B. No. 3 of the 123rd General 1641
Assembly, the universal service rider authorized by section 1642
4928.51 of the Revised Code, and the temporary rider authorized 1643
by section 4928.61 of the Revised Code. For the purpose of this 1644
division, the rate cap applicable to a customer receiving 1645
electric service pursuant to an arrangement approved by the 1646
commission under section 4905.31 of the Revised Code is, for the 1647
term of the arrangement, the total of all rates and charges in 1648
effect under the arrangement. For any rate schedule filed 1649
pursuant to section 4905.30 of the Revised Code or any 1650
arrangement subject to approval pursuant to section 4905.31 of 1651
the Revised Code, the initial tax-related adjustment to the rate 1652
cap required by this division shall be equal to the rate of 1653
taxation specified in section 5727.81 of the Revised Code and 1654
applicable to the schedule or arrangement. To the extent such 1655
total annual amount of the tax-related adjustment is greater 1656
than or less than the comparable amount of the total annual tax 1657
reduction experienced by the electric utility as a result of the 1658
provisions of Sub. S.B. No. 3 of the 123rd general assembly, 1659
such difference shall be addressed by the commission through 1660
accounting procedures, refunds, or an annual surcharge or credit 1661
to customers, or through other appropriate means, to avoid 1662
placing the financial responsibility for the difference upon the 1663
electric utility or its shareholders. Any adjustments in the 1664
rate of taxation specified in section 5727.81 of the Revised 1665
Code section shall not occur without a corresponding adjustment 1666
to the rate cap for each such rate schedule or arrangement. The 1667
department of taxation shall advise the commission and self- 1668
assessors under section 5727.81 of the Revised Code prior to the 1669
effective date of any change in the rate of taxation specified 1670
under that section, and the commission shall modify the rate cap 1671
to reflect that adjustment so that the rate cap adjustment is 1672

H. B. No. 15 Page 58

effective as of the effective date of the change in the rate of 1673
taxation. This division shall be applied, to the extent 1674
possible, to eliminate any increase in the price of electricity 1675
for customers that otherwise may occur as a result of 1676
establishing the taxes contemplated in section 5727.81 of the 1677
Revised Code. 1678

adopted by the commission under division (A) of section 4928.06 1680
of the Revised Code. 1681
(8) The corporate separation plan required by division (A) 1682
(2) of section 4928.31 of the Revised Code complies with section 1683
4928.17 of the Revised Code and any rules adopted by the 1684
commission under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the Revised 1685
Code. 1686
(9) Any plan or plans the commission requires to address 1687
operational support systems and any other technical 1688
implementation issues pertaining to competitive retail electric 1689
service comply with any rules adopted by the commission under 1690
division (A) of section 4928.06 of the Revised Code. 1691
(10) The employee assistance plan required by division (A) 1692
(4) of section 4928.31 of the Revised Code sufficiently provides 1693
severance, retraining, early retirement, retention, 1694
outplacement, and other assistance for the utility's employees 1695
whose employment is affected by electric industry restructuring 1696
under this chapter. 1697
(11) The consumer education plan required under division 1698
(A)(5) of section 4928.31 of the Revised Code complies with 1699
former section 4928.42 of the Revised Code and any rules adopted 1700
by the commission under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the 1701

(12) The transition revenues for which an electric utility 1703
is authorized a revenue opportunity under sections 4928.31 to 1704
4928.40 of the Revised Code are the allowable transition costs 1705
of the utility as such costs are determined by the commission 1706
pursuant to section 4928.39 of the Revised Code, and the 1707
transition charges for the customer classes and rate schedules 1708
of the utility are the charges determined pursuant to section 1709
4928.40 of the Revised Code. 1710
(13) Any independent transmission plan included in the 1711
transition plan filed under section 4928.31 of the Revised Code 1712
reasonably complies with section 4928.12 of the Revised Code and 1713

section 4928.06 of the Revised Code, unless the commission, for 1715
good cause shown, authorizes the utility to defer compliance 1716
until an order is issued under division (G) of section 4928.35 1717
of the Revised Code. 1718
(14) The utility is in compliance with sections 4928.01 to 1719
4928.11 of the Revised Code and any rules or orders of the 1720
commission adopted or issued under those sections. 1721
(15) All unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan 1722
have been adjusted to reflect the elimination of the tax on 1723
gross receipts imposed by section 5727.30 of the Revised Code. 1724
In addition, a transition plan approved by the commission 1725
under section 4928.33 of the Revised Code but not containing an 1726
approved independent transmission plan shall contain the express 1727
conditions that the utility will comply with an order issued 1728

Revised Code, if If the commission finds that any part of the 1731
transition plan would constitute an abandonment under sections 1732
4905.20 and 4905.21 of the Revised Code, the commission shall 1733
not approve that part of the transition plan unless it makes the 1734
finding required for approval of an abandonment application 1735
under section 4905.21 of the Revised Code. Sections 4905.20 and 1736
4905.21 of the Revised Code otherwise shall not apply to a 1737

programs as provided under division (A)(2)(c) of section 4928.66 1769
of the Revised Code, including, but not limited to, any of the 1770
following: 1771
(i) A resource that has the effect of improving the 1772
relationship between real and reactive power; 1773
(ii) A resource that makes efficient use of waste heat or 1774
other thermal capabilities owned or controlled by a mercantile 1775
customer; 1776
(iii) Storage technology that allows a mercantile customer 1777
more flexibility to modify its demand or load and usage 1778
characteristics; 1779
(iv) Electric generation equipment owned or controlled by 1780
a mercantile customer that uses a renewable energy resource. 1781
(2) For the purpose of this section and as it considers 1782
appropriate, the public utilities commission may classify any 1783
new technology as such a qualifying renewable energy resource. 1784
(B)(1) By the end of 2026, an electric distribution 1785
utility shall have provided from qualifying renewable energy 1786
resources, including, at its discretion, qualifying renewable 1787

energy resources obtained pursuant to an electricity supply 1788
contract, a portion of the electricity supply required for its 1789
standard service offer under section sections 4928.141 and 1790
4928.142 of the Revised Code, and an electric services company 1791
shall have provided a portion of its electricity supply for 1792
retail consumers in this state from qualifying renewable energy 1793
resources, including, at its discretion, qualifying renewable 1794
energy resources obtained pursuant to an electricity supply 1795
contract. That portion shall equal eight and one-half per cent 1796
of the total number of kilowatt hours of electricity sold by the 1797
subject utility or company to any and all retail electric 1798
consumers whose electric load centers are served by that utility 1799
and are located within the utility's certified territory or, in 1800
the case of an electric services company, are served by the 1801
company and are located within this state. However, nothing in 1802
this section precludes a utility or company from providing a 1803
greater percentage. 1804
(2) Subject to section 4928.642 of the Revised Code, the 1805
The portion required under division (B)(1) of this section shall 1806

(C)(1) The commission annually shall review an electric 1815
distribution utility's or electric services company's compliance 1816
with the most recent applicable benchmark under division (B)(2) 1817
of this section and, in the course of that review, shall 1818
identify any undercompliance or noncompliance of the utility or 1819
company that it determines is weather-related, related to 1820
equipment or resource shortages for qualifying renewable energy 1821
resources as applicable, or is otherwise outside the utility's 1822
or company's control. 1823
(2) Subject to the cost cap provisions of division (C)(3) 1824
of this section, if the commission determines, after notice and 1825
opportunity for hearing, and based upon its findings in that 1826
review regarding avoidable undercompliance or noncompliance, but 1827
subject to division (C)(4) of this section, that the utility or 1828
company has failed to comply with any such benchmark, the 1829
commission shall impose a renewable energy compliance payment on 1830
the utility or company. 1831
(a) The compliance payment pertaining to the solar energy 1832
resource benchmarks under division (B)(2) of this section shall 1833
be an amount per megawatt hour of undercompliance or 1834
noncompliance in the period under review, as follows: 1835
(i) Three hundred dollars for 2014, 2015, and 2016; 1836
(ii) Two hundred fifty dollars for 2017 and 2018; 1837
(iii) Two hundred dollars for 2019. 1838
(b) The compliance payment pertaining to the renewable 1839
energy resource benchmarks under division (B)(2) of this section 1840
shall equal the number of additional renewable energy credits 1841
that the electric distribution utility or electric services 1842
company would have needed to comply with the applicable 1843

H. B. No. 15 Page 65

benchmark in the period under review times an amount that shall 1844
begin at forty-five dollars and shall be adjusted annually by 1845
the commission to reflect any change in the consumer price index 1846
as defined in section 101.27 of the Revised Code, but shall not 1847
be less than forty-five dollars. As used in this division, 1848
"consumer price index" means the consumer price index prepared 1849
by the United States bureau of labor statistics (U.S. city 1850
average for urban wage earners and clerical workers: all items, 1851
1982-1984=100), or, if that index is no longer published, a 1852
generally available comparable index. 1853
(c) The compliance payment shall not be passed through by 1854
the electric distribution utility or electric services company 1855
to consumers. The compliance payment shall be remitted to the 1856
commission, for deposit to the credit of the advanced energy 1857
fund created under section 4928.61 of the Revised Code. Payment 1858
of the compliance payment shall be subject to such collection 1859
and enforcement procedures as apply to the collection of a 1860
forfeiture under sections 4905.55 to 4905.60 and 4905.64 of the 1861
Revised Code. 1862
(3) An electric distribution utility or an electric 1863
services company need not comply with a benchmark under division 1864
(B)(2) of this section to the extent that its reasonably 1865
expected cost of that compliance exceeds its reasonably expected 1866
cost of otherwise producing or acquiring the requisite 1867
electricity by three per cent or more. The cost of compliance 1868
shall be calculated as though any exemption from taxes and 1869
assessments had not been granted under section 5727.75 of the 1870
Revised Code. 1871
(4)(a) An electric distribution utility or electric 1872
services company may request the commission to make a force 1873

majeure determination pursuant to this division regarding all or 1874
part of the utility's or company's compliance with any minimum 1875
benchmark under division (B)(2) of this section during the 1876
period of review occurring pursuant to division (C)(2) of this 1877
section. The commission may require the electric distribution 1878
utility or electric services company to make solicitations for 1879
renewable energy resource credits as part of its default service 1880
before the utility's or company's request of force majeure under 1881
this division can be made. 1882
(b) Within ninety days after the filing of a request by an 1883
electric distribution utility or electric services company under 1884
division (C)(4)(a) of this section, the commission shall 1885
determine if qualifying renewable energy resources are 1886
reasonably available in the marketplace in sufficient quantities 1887
for the utility or company to comply with the subject minimum 1888
benchmark during the review period. In making this 1889
determination, the commission shall consider whether the 1890
electric distribution utility or electric services company has 1891
made a good faith effort to acquire sufficient qualifying 1892
renewable energy or, as applicable, solar energy resources to so 1893
comply, including, but not limited to, by banking or seeking 1894
renewable energy resource credits or by seeking the resources 1895
through long-term contracts. Additionally, the commission shall 1896
consider the availability of qualifying renewable energy or 1897
solar energy resources in this state and other jurisdictions in 1898
the PJM interconnection regional transmission organization, 1899
L.L.C., or its successor and the midcontinent independent system 1900
operator or its successor. 1901
(c) If, pursuant to division (C)(4)(b) of this section, 1902
the commission determines that qualifying renewable energy or 1903
solar energy resources are not reasonably available to permit 1904

the electric distribution utility or electric services company 1905
to comply, during the period of review, with the subject minimum 1906
benchmark prescribed under division (B)(2) of this section, the 1907
commission shall modify that compliance obligation of the 1908
utility or company as it determines appropriate to accommodate 1909
the finding. Commission modification shall not automatically 1910
reduce the obligation for the electric distribution utility's or 1911
electric services company's compliance in subsequent years. If 1912
it modifies the electric distribution utility or electric 1913
services company obligation under division (C)(4)(c) of this 1914
section, the commission may require the utility or company, if 1915
sufficient renewable energy resource credits exist in the 1916
marketplace, to acquire additional renewable energy resource 1917
credits in subsequent years equivalent to the utility's or 1918
company's modified obligation under division (C)(4)(c) of this 1919
section. 1920
(5) The commission shall establish a process to provide 1921
for at least an annual review of the renewable energy resource 1922
market in this state and in the service territories of the 1923
regional transmission organizations that manage transmission 1924
systems located in this state. The commission shall use the 1925
results of this study to identify any needed changes to the 1926
amount of the renewable energy compliance payment specified 1927
under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of this section. Specifically, 1928
the commission may increase the amount to ensure that payment of 1929
compliance payments is not used to achieve compliance with this 1930
section in lieu of actually acquiring or realizing energy 1931
derived from qualifying renewable energy resources. However, if 1932
the commission finds that the amount of the compliance payment 1933
should be otherwise changed, the commission shall present this 1934
finding to the general assembly for legislative enactment. 1935

(D) The commission annually shall submit to the general 1936
assembly in accordance with section 101.68 of the Revised Code a 1937
report describing all of the following: 1938
(1) The compliance of electric distribution utilities and 1939
electric services companies with division (B) of this section; 1940
(2) The average annual cost of renewable energy credits 1941
purchased by utilities and companies for the year covered in the 1942
report; 1943
(3) Any strategy for utility and company compliance or for 1944
encouraging the use of qualifying renewable energy resources in 1945
supplying this state's electricity needs in a manner that 1946
considers available technology, costs, job creation, and 1947
economic impacts. 1948
The commission shall begin providing the information 1949
described in division (D)(2) of this section in each report 1950
submitted after September 10, 2012. The commission shall allow 1951
and consider public comments on the report prior to its 1952
submission to the general assembly. Nothing in the report shall 1953
be binding on any person, including any utility or company for 1954
the purpose of its compliance with any benchmark under division 1955
(B) of this section, or the enforcement of that provision under 1956
division (C) of this section. 1957
(E) All costs incurred by an electric distribution utility 1958
in complying with the requirements of this section shall be 1959
bypassable by any consumer that has exercised choice of supplier 1960
under section 4928.03 of the Revised Code. 1961
Sec. 4928.645. (A) An electric distribution utility or 1962
electric services company may use, for the purpose of complying 1963

4928.64 of the Revised Code, renewable energy credits any time 1965
in the five calendar years following the date of their purchase 1966
or acquisition from any entity, including, but not limited to, 1967
the following: 1968
(1) A mercantile customer; 1969
(2) An owner or operator of a hydroelectric generating 1970
facility that is located at a dam on a river, or on any water 1971
discharged to a river, that is within or bordering this state or 1972
within or bordering an adjoining state, or that produces power 1973
that can be shown to be deliverable into this state; 1974
(3) A seller of compressed natural gas that has been 1975
produced from biologically derived methane gas, provided that 1976
the seller may only provide renewable energy credits for metered 1977
amounts of gas. 1978
(B)(1) The public utilities commission shall adopt rules 1979
specifying that one unit of credit shall equal one megawatt hour 1980
of electricity derived from renewable energy resources, except 1981
that, for a generating facility of seventy-five megawatts or 1982
greater that is situated within this state and has committed by 1983
December 31, 2009, to modify or retrofit its generating unit or 1984
units to enable the facility to generate principally from 1985
biomass energy by June 30, 2013, each megawatt hour of 1986
electricity generated principally from that biomass energy shall 1987
equal, in units of credit, the product obtained by multiplying 1988
the actual percentage of biomass feedstock heat input used to 1989
generate such megawatt hour by the quotient obtained by dividing 1990
the then existing unit dollar amount used to determine a 1991
renewable energy compliance payment as provided under division 1992
(C)(2)(b) of section 4928.64 of the Revised Code by the then 1993
existing market value of one renewable energy credit, but such 1994

H. B. No. 15 Page 70
As Introduced
megawatt hour shall not equal less than one unit of credit. 1995
Renewable energy resources do not have to be converted to 1996
electricity in order to be eligible to receive renewable energy 1997
credits. The rules shall specify that, for purposes of 1998
converting the quantity of energy derived from biologically 1999
derived methane gas to an electricity equivalent, one megawatt 2000
hour equals 3,412,142 British thermal units. 2001
(2) The rules also shall provide for this state a system 2002
of registering renewable energy credits by specifying which of 2003
any generally available registries shall be used for that 2004
purpose and not by creating a registry. That selected system of 2005
registering renewable energy credits shall allow a hydroelectric 2006
generating facility to be eligible for obtaining renewable 2007
energy credits and shall allow customer-sited projects or 2008
actions the broadest opportunities to be eligible for obtaining 2009
renewable energy credits. 2010
(C) Beginning January 1, 2020, a qualifying solar resource 2011
as defined in section 3706.40 of the Revised Code is not 2012
eligible to obtain a renewable energy credit under this section 2013
for any megawatt hour for which the resource has been issued a 2014
solar energy credit under section 3706.45 of the Revised Code. 2015
(D) Except for compressed natural gas that has been 2016
produced from biologically derived methane gas, energy generated 2017
by using natural gas as a resource is not eligible to obtain a 2018
renewable energy credit under this section. 2019
Sec. 4929.20. (A)(A)(1) No governmental aggregator as 2020

by the public utilities commission regarding its managerial, 2026
technical, and financial capability to provide that service and 2027
providing reasonable financial assurances sufficient to protect 2028
customers and natural gas companies from default. In addition, a 2029
retail natural gas supplier may be required to provide a 2030
performance bond sufficient to protect customers and natural gas 2031
companies from default. Certification shall be granted pursuant 2032
to procedures and standards the commission shall prescribe in 2033
accordance with rules adopted under section 4929.10 of the 2034
Revised Code. However, certification or certification renewal 2035
shall be deemed approved thirty days after the filing of an 2036
application with the commission unless the commission suspends 2037
that approval for good cause shown. In the case of such a 2038
suspension, the commission shall act to approve or deny 2039
certification or certification renewal to the applicant not 2040
later than ninety days after the date of the suspension. 2041
(2) The commission shall establish rules to require a 2042
competitive retail natural gas supplier to maintain financial 2043
assurances sufficient to protect customers and natural gas 2044
companies from default. Such rules also shall specifically allow 2045
a natural gas company to set reasonable standards for its 2046
security and the security of its customers through financial 2047
requirements set in its tariffs. 2048
(3) As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "retail 2049
natural gas supplier" has the same meaning as in section 4929.01 2050
of the Revised Code, but excludes a broker or aggregator. 2051
(B) Capability standards adopted in rules pursuant to 2052

minimum service requirements established under section 4929.23 2055
of the Revised Code. The standards shall allow flexibility for 2056
voluntary aggregation, to encourage market creativity in 2057
responding to consumer needs and demands. The rules shall 2058
include procedures for biennially renewing certification. 2059
(C)(1) The commission may suspend, rescind, or 2060
conditionally rescind the certification of any retail natural 2061
gas supplier or governmental aggregator issued under this 2062
section if the commission determines, after reasonable notice 2063
and opportunity for hearing, that the retail natural gas 2064
supplier or governmental aggregator has failed to comply with 2065
any applicable certification standards prescribed in rules 2066
adopted pursuant to this section or section 4929.22 of the 2067
Revised Code. 2068
(2) An affected natural gas company may file an 2069
application with the commission for approval of authority to 2070
recover in accordance with division (C)(2) of this section 2071
incremental costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the 2072
company in connection with the commission's continuation, 2073
suspension, rescission, or conditional rescission of a 2074
particular retail natural gas supplier's certification under 2075
division (C)(1) of this section. Upon the filing of such an 2076
application, the commission shall conduct an audit of such 2077
incremental costs as are specified in the application. Cost 2078
recovery shall be through a rider on the base rates of customers 2079
of the company for which there is a choice of supplier of 2080
commodity sales service as a result of revised schedules 2081
approved under division (C) of section 4929.29 of the Revised 2082

the application's filing unless the commission, based on the 2087
audit results and for good cause shown, sets the matter for 2088
hearing. After the hearing, the commission shall approve the 2089
application, and authorize such cost recovery rider effective on 2090
the date specified in the order, only for such incremental costs 2091
as the commission determines were reasonably and prudently 2092
incurred by the company in connection with the continuation, 2093
suspension, rescission, or conditional rescission of a retail 2094
natural gas supplier's certification under division (C)(1) of 2095
this section. Any proceeding under division (C)(2) of this 2096
section shall be governed by Chapter 4903. of the Revised Code. 2097
(D) No natural gas company, on and after thirteen months 2098
following the effective date of this section June 26, 2001, 2099
shall knowingly distribute natural gas, to a retail consumer in 2100
this state, for any governmental aggregator, as defined in 2101
division (K)(1) of section 4929.01 of the Revised Code, or 2102
retail natural gas supplier, that has not been certified by the 2103
commission pursuant to this section. 2104
(E) Notwithstanding any provision of section 121.95 of the 2105
Revised Code to the contrary, a regulatory restriction contained 2106
in a rule adopted under section 4929.20 of the Revised Code is 2107
not subject to sections 121.95 to 121.953 of the Revised Code. 2108
