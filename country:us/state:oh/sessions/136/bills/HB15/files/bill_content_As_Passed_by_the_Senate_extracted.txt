conservation measures and the savings thereof as described under 306
division (G)(1) of section 133.06 of the Revised Code as a 307
requirement for issuing energy securities, makes a finding that 308
the amount spent on such measures is not likely to exceed the 309
amount of money it would save in energy costs and resultant 310
operational and maintenance costs as described in that division, 311

construction commission for a loan from the school energy 322
performance contracting loan fund, established by section 323

Section 42:
3313.378 of the Revised Code, for purposes of paying for all or 324
part of an installment contract under division (B) of this 325

Section 43:
section. 326
Sec. 3313.373. (A) As used in this section: 327
(1) "Energy saving measure" means both of the following: 328
(a) The acquisition and installation, by purchase, lease, 329
lease purchase, lease with an option to buy, or installment 330
purchase, of an energy conservation measure as defined in 331

related to energy conservation. 335
(2) "Shared-savings contract" means a contract for one or 336
more energy savings measures, which contract provides that all 337
payments, except payments for maintenance and repairs and 338
obligations on termination of the contract prior to its 339
expiration, are to be a stated percentage of calculated savings 340
of energy costs attributable to the energy saving measure over a 341
defined period of time and are to be made only to the extent 342
that such savings occur. A contract that requires any additional 343
capital investment or contribution of funds, other than funds 344
available from state or federal energy grants, or that is for an 345
initial term of longer than ten years is not a shared-savings 346
contract. 347

village, or joint vocational school district may enter into a 349
shared-savings contract with any person experienced in the 350
design and implementation of energy saving measures for 351
buildings owned or rented by the board. Such contract is not 352
subject to section 3313.46 of the Revised Code. If the contract 353
is for a term extending beyond the fiscal year, it shall be 354
considered to be a continuing contract within the meaning of 355
division (D) of section 5705.41 of the Revised Code. A board of 356
education entering into an installment contract under this 357

Section 45:

work in progress, the dollar value of the project or portion 1469
thereof included in the valuation as construction work in 1470
progress shall not be included in the valuation as plant in 1471
service until such time as the total revenue effect of the 1472
construction work in progress allowance is offset by the total 1473
revenue effect of the plant in service exclusion. Carrying 1474
charges calculated in a manner similar to allowance for funds 1475
used during construction shall accrue on that portion of the 1476
project in service but not reflected in rates as plant in 1477
service, and such accrued carrying charges shall be included in 1478
the valuation of the property at the conclusion of the offset 1479
period for purposes of division (C)(9) of section 4909.05 of the 1480
Revised Code. 1481

for construction work in progress as it relates to a particular 1489
construction project shall be tolled if, and to the extent, a 1490
delay in the in-service date of the project is caused by the 1491
action or inaction of any federal, state, county, or municipal 1492
agency having jurisdiction, where such action or inaction 1493
relates to a change in a rule, standard, or approval of such 1494
agency, and where such action or inaction is not the result of 1495
the failure of the utility to reasonably endeavor to comply with 1496
any rule, standard, or approval prior to such change. 1497
Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 53
As Passed by the Senate
In the event that such period expires before the project 1498
goes into service, the commission shall exclude, from the date 1499
of expiration, the allowance for the project as construction 1500
work in progress from rates, except that the commission may 1501
extend the expiration date up to twelve months for good cause 1502
shown. 1503
In the event that a utility has permanently canceled, 1504
abandoned, or terminated construction of a project for which it 1505
was previously permitted a construction work in progress 1506
allowance, the commission immediately shall exclude the 1507
allowance for the project from the valuation. 1508
In the event that a construction work in progress project 1509
previously included in the valuation is removed from the 1510
valuation pursuant to this division, any revenues collected by 1511
the utility from its customers after April 10, 1985, that 1512
resulted from such prior inclusion shall be offset against 1513
future revenues over the same period of time as the project was 1514
included in the valuation as construction work in progress. The 1515
total revenue effect of such offset shall not exceed the total 1516
revenues previously collected. 1517
In no event shall the total revenue effect of any offset 1518
or offsets provided under division (A)(1) of this section exceed 1519
the total revenue effect of any construction work in progress 1520
allowance. 1521
(2) A fair and reasonable rate of return to the utility on 1522
the valuation as determined in division (A)(1) of this section; 1523
(3) The dollar annual return to which the utility is 1524
entitled by applying the fair and reasonable rate of return as 1525

(a) Federal, state, and local taxes imposed on or measured 1535
by net income may, in the discretion of the commission, be 1536
computed by the normalization method of accounting, provided the 1537
utility maintains accounting reserves that reflect differences 1538
between taxes actually payable and taxes on a normalized basis, 1539
provided that no determination as to the treatment in the rate- 1540
making process of such taxes shall be made that will result in 1541
loss of any tax depreciation or other tax benefit to which the 1542
utility would otherwise be entitled, and further provided that 1543
such tax benefit as redounds to the utility as a result of such 1544
a computation may not be retained by the company, used to fund 1545
any dividend or distribution, or utilized for any purpose other 1546

period. If the company proposes a forecasted test period, the 1577
company shall propose annual base rates for three consecutive 1578
twelve-month periods in a single forecasted test period 1579
application. 1580
During the first twelve-month period, the company shall 1581
propose a reasonably forecasted rate base using a thirteen-month 1582
average, revenues, and expenses for the first twelve months that 1583
new base rates will be in effect. 1584

investment, actual revenues, and actual expenses shall be trued 1594
up via a cost recovery mechanism approved by the commission. 1595
Each true-up process shall include an adjustment to actual 1596
for the rate of return that the company is authorized to earn on 1597
the actual investments made. The company shall provide the 1598
commission with actual financial information during the true-up 1599
process to ensure accuracy. As part of the true-up process, the 1600
commission shall include only rate base components that have 1601
been found by the commission to be used and useful in rendering 1602
public utility service. 1603
At the end of the last test period, the company shall file 1604
for a rate case under section 4909.18 of the Revised Code. 1605
(b) All utilities, except for electric light companies 1606

shall propose a test period for this determination that is any 1608
twelve-month period beginning not more than six months prior to 1609
the date the application is filed and ending not more than nine 1610

(3) A standard service offer under section 4928.142 or 2894

Section 129:
4928.143 of the Revised Code shall exclude any previously 2895
authorized allowances for transition costs, with such exclusion 2896
being effective on and after the date that the allowance is 2897
scheduled to end under the utility's rate electric security 2898
plan. 2899
(B) The commission shall set the time for hearing of a 2900
filing under section 4928.142 or 4928.143 of the Revised Code, 2901
send written notice of the hearing to the electric distribution 2902
utility, and publish notice in a newspaper of general 2903
circulation in each county in the utility's certified territory. 2904
The commission shall adopt rules regarding filings under those 2905

As Passed by the Senate
requirement requirements of division (A) of section 4928.141 of 2910
the Revised Code, an electric distribution utility may shall 2911
establish a standard service offer price for retail electric 2912
generation service that is delivered to the utility under a 2913
market-rate offer. 2914
(1) The market-rate offer shall be determined through a 2915
competitive bidding process that provides for all of the 2916
following: 2917
(a) Open, fair, and transparent competitive solicitation; 2918
(b) Clear product definition; 2919
(c) Standardized bid evaluation criteria; 2920
(d) Oversight by an independent third party that shall 2921
design the solicitation, administer the bidding, and ensure that 2922
the criteria specified in division divisions (A)(1)(a) to (c) of 2923
this section are met; 2924
(e) Evaluation of the submitted bids prior to the 2925
selection of the least-cost bid winner or winners. 2926
No generation supplier shall be prohibited from 2927
participating in the bidding process. 2928
(2) The public utilities commission shall modify rules, or 2929
adopt new rules as necessary, concerning the conduct of the 2930
competitive bidding process and the qualifications of bidders, 2931
which rules shall foster supplier participation in the bidding 2932
process and shall be consistent with the requirements of 2933
division (A)(1) of this section. 2934
(B) Prior to initiating a competitive bidding process for 2935
a market-rate offer under division (A) of this section, the 2936
electric distribution utility shall file an application with the 2937
Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 102
As Passed by the Senate
commission. An electric distribution utility may file its 2938
application with the commission prior to the effective date of 2939
the commission rules required under division (A)(2) of this 2940

Section 132:
section, and, as the commission determines necessary, the 2941
utility shall immediately conform its filing to the rules upon 2942
their taking effect. 2943
An application under this division shall detail the 2944
electric distribution utility's proposed compliance with the 2945
requirements of division (A)(1) of this section and with 2946
commission rules under division (A)(2) of this section and 2947
demonstrate that all of the following requirements are met: 2948
(1) The electric distribution utility or its transmission 2949
service affiliate belongs to at least one regional transmission 2950
organization that has been approved by the federal energy 2951
regulatory commission; or there otherwise is comparable and 2952
nondiscriminatory access to the electric transmission grid. 2953
(2) Any such regional transmission organization has a 2954
market-monitor function and the ability to take actions to 2955
identify and mitigate market power or the electric distribution 2956
utility's market conduct; or a similar market monitoring 2957
function exists with commensurate ability to identify and 2958
monitor market conditions and mitigate conduct associated with 2959
the exercise of market power. 2960
(3) A published source of information is available 2961
publicly or through subscription that identifies pricing 2962
information for traded electricity on- and off-peak energy 2963
products that are contracts for delivery beginning at least two 2964
years from the date of the publication and is updated on a 2965
regular basis. 2966
Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 103
As Passed by the Senate
The commission shall initiate a proceeding and, within 2967
ninety days after the application's filing date, shall determine 2968
by order whether the electric distribution utility and its 2969
market-rate offer meet all of the foregoing requirements. If the 2970
finding is positive, the electric distribution utility may shall 2971
initiate its competitive bidding process. If the finding is 2972
negative as to one or more requirements, the commission in the 2973
order shall direct the electric distribution utility regarding 2974
how any deficiency may shall be timely remedied in a timely 2975
manner to the commission's satisfaction; otherwise, the electric 2976
distribution utility shall withdraw the application. However, if 2977
such remedy is made and the subsequent finding is positive and 2978
also if the electric distribution utility made a simultaneous 2979
filing under this section and section 4928.143 of the Revised 2980
Code, the utility shall not initiate its competitive bid until 2981
at least one hundred fifty days after the filing date of those 2982
applications. 2983
(C) Upon the completion of the competitive bidding process 2984
authorized by divisions (A) and (B) of this section, including 2985
for the purpose of division (D) of this section, the commission 2986
shall select the least-cost bid winner or winners of that 2987
process, and such selected bid or bids, as prescribed as retail 2988
rates by the commission, shall be the electric distribution 2989
utility's standard service offer unless the commission, by order 2990
issued before the third calendar day following the conclusion of 2991
the competitive bidding process for the market rate offer, 2992
determines that one or more of the following criteria were not 2993
met: 2994
(1) Each portion of the bidding process was 2995
oversubscribed, such that the amount of supply bid upon was 2996
greater than the amount of the load bid out. 2997
Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 104
As Passed by the Senate
(2) There were four or more bidders. 2998
(3) At least twenty-five per cent of the load is bid upon 2999
by one or more persons other than the electric distribution 3000
utility. 3001
All costs incurred by the electric distribution utility as 3002
a result of or related to the competitive bidding process or to 3003
procuring generation service to provide the standard service 3004
offer, including the costs of energy and capacity and the costs 3005
of all other products and services procured as a result of the 3006
competitive bidding process, shall be timely recovered through 3007
the standard service offer price, and, for that purpose, the 3008
commission shall approve a reconciliation mechanism, other 3009
recovery mechanism, or a combination of such mechanisms for the 3010
utility. 3011
(D) The first application filed under this section by an 3012
electric distribution utility that, as of July 31, 2008, 3013
directly owns, in whole or in part, operating electric 3014
generating facilities that had been used and useful in this 3015
state shall require that a portion of that the utility's 3016
standard service offer load for the first five years of the 3017
market rate offer be competitively bid under division (A) of 3018
this section as follows: ten per cent of the load in year one, 3019
not more than twenty per cent in year two, thirty per cent in 3020
year three, forty per cent in year four, and fifty per cent in 3021
year five. Consistent with those percentages, the commission 3022
shall determine the actual percentages for each year of years 3023
one through five. The standard service offer price for retail 3024
electric generation service under this first application shall 3025
be a proportionate blend of the bid price and the generation 3026
service price for the remaining standard service offer load, 3027
Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 105
As Passed by the Senate
which latter price shall be equal to the electric distribution 3028
utility's most recent standard service offer price, adjusted 3029
upward or downward as the commission determines reasonable, 3030
relative to the jurisdictional portion of any known and 3031
measurable changes from the level of any one or more of the 3032
following costs as reflected in that most recent standard 3033
service offer price: 3034
(1) The electric distribution utility's prudently incurred 3035
cost of fuel used to produce electricity; 3036
(2) Its prudently incurred purchased power costs; 3037
(3) Its prudently incurred costs of satisfying the supply 3038
and demand portfolio requirements of this state, including, but 3039
not limited to, renewable energy resource and energy efficiency 3040
requirements; 3041
(4) Its costs prudently incurred to comply with 3042
environmental laws and regulations, with consideration of the 3043
derating of any facility associated with those costs. 3044
In making any adjustment to the most recent standard 3045
service offer price on the basis of costs described in division 3046
(D) of this section, the commission shall include the benefits 3047
that may become available to the electric distribution utility 3048
as a result of or in connection with the costs included in the 3049
adjustment, including, but not limited to, the utility's receipt 3050
of emissions credits or its receipt of tax benefits or of other 3051
benefits, and, accordingly, the commission may impose such 3052
conditions on the adjustment to ensure that any such benefits 3053
are properly aligned with the associated cost responsibility. 3054
The commission shall also determine how such adjustments will 3055
affect the electric distribution utility's return on common 3056
Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 106
As Passed by the Senate
equity that may be achieved by those adjustments. The commission 3057
shall not apply its consideration of the return on common equity 3058
to reduce any adjustments authorized under this division unless 3059
the adjustments will cause the electric distribution utility to 3060
earn a return on common equity that is significantly in excess 3061
of the return on common equity that is earned by publicly traded 3062
companies, including utilities, that face comparable business 3063
and financial risk, with such adjustments for capital structure 3064
as may be appropriate. The burden of proof for demonstrating 3065
that significantly excessive earnings will not occur shall be on 3066
the electric distribution utility. 3067
Additionally, the commission may adjust the electric 3068
distribution utility's most recent standard service offer price 3069
by such just and reasonable amount that the commission 3070
determines necessary to address any emergency that threatens the 3071
utility's financial integrity or to ensure that the resulting 3072
revenue available to the utility for providing the standard 3073
service offer is not so inadequate as to result, directly or 3074
indirectly, in a taking of property without compensation 3075
pursuant to Section 19 of Article I, Ohio Constitution. The 3076
electric distribution utility has the burden of demonstrating 3077
that any adjustment to its most recent standard service offer 3078
price is proper in accordance with this division. 3079
(E) Beginning in the second year of a blended price under 3080
division (D) of this section and notwithstanding any other 3081
requirement of this section, the commission may alter 3082
prospectively the proportions specified in that division to 3083
mitigate any effect of an abrupt or significant change in the 3084
electric distribution utility's standard service offer price 3085
that would otherwise result in general or with respect to any 3086
rate group or rate schedule but for such alteration. Any such 3087
Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 107
As Passed by the Senate
alteration shall be made not more often than annually, and the 3088
commission shall not, by altering those proportions and in any 3089
event, including because of the length of time, as authorized 3090
under division (C) of this section, taken to approve the market 3091
rate offer, cause the duration of the blending period to exceed 3092
ten years as counted from the effective date of the approved 3093
market rate offer. Additionally, any such alteration shall be 3094
limited to an alteration affecting the prospective proportions 3095
used during the blending period and shall not affect any 3096
blending proportion previously approved and applied by the 3097
commission under this division. 3098
(F) An electric distribution utility that has received 3099
commission approval of its first application under division (C) 3100
of this section shall not, nor ever shall be authorized or 3101
required by the commission to, file an application under section 3102

Section 133:
4928.143 of the Revised Code. 3103
Sec. 4928.144. The public utilities commission by order 3104
may authorize any just and reasonable phase-in of any electric 3105
distribution utility rate or price established under sections 3106

Section 134:
4928.141 to 4928.143 and 4928.142 of the Revised Code, and 3107
inclusive of carrying charges, as the commission considers 3108
necessary to ensure rate or price stability for consumers. If 3109
the commission's order includes such a phase-in, the order also 3110
shall provide for the creation of regulatory assets pursuant to 3111
generally accepted accounting principles, by authorizing the 3112
deferral of incurred costs equal to the amount not collected, 3113
plus carrying charges on that amount. Further, the order shall 3114
authorize the collection of those deferrals through a 3115
nonbypassable surcharge on any such rate or price so established 3116
for the electric distribution utility by the commission. 3117
Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 108
As Passed by the Senate
Sec. 4928.149. No electric distribution utility may use 3118
any electric energy storage system to participate in the 3119
wholesale market, if the utility purchased or acquired that 3120
system for distribution service. 3121
Sec. 4928.1410. If an electric distribution utility has a n 3122
existing electric security plan under which the commission had 3123
authorized the creation or continuation of riders, then, to the 3124
extent those riders will cease to exist after termination of the 3125
electric security plan, the electric distribution utility is 3126
authorized to create necessary regulatory assets or liabilities, 3127
along with carrying costs at the utility's weighted average cost 3128
of debt, for the resolution of any outstanding under-collection 3129
or over-collection of funds under such riders. The resolution of 3130
such regulatory assets or liabilities shall be addressed in the 3131
first distribution rate case under section 4909.18 of the 3132
Revised Code that occurs after the plan's expiration. 3133
Sec. 4928.17. (A) Except as otherwise provided in sections 3134

Section 135:
4928.141 or 4928.142 or 4928.143 or 4928.31 to 4928.40 of the 3135
Revised Code and beginning on the starting date of competitive 3136
retail electric service, no electric utility shall engage in 3137
this state, either directly or through an affiliate, in the 3138
businesses of supplying a noncompetitive retail electric service 3139
and supplying a competitive retail electric service, or in the 3140
businesses of supplying a noncompetitive retail electric service 3141
and supplying a product or service other than retail electric 3142
service, unless the utility implements and operates under a 3143
corporate separation plan that is approved by the public 3144
utilities commission under this section, is consistent with the 3145
policy specified in section 4928.02 of the Revised Code, and 3146
achieves all of the following: 3147
Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 109
As Passed by the Senate
(1) The plan provides, at minimum, for the provision of 3148
the competitive retail electric service or the nonelectric 3149
product or service through a fully separated affiliate of the 3150
utility, and the plan includes separate accounting requirements, 3151
the code of conduct as ordered by the commission pursuant to a 3152
rule it shall adopt under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the 3153
Revised Code, and such other measures as are necessary to 3154
effectuate the policy specified in section 4928.02 of the 3155
Revised Code. 3156
(2) The plan satisfies the public interest in preventing 3157
unfair competitive advantage and preventing the abuse of market 3158
power. 3159
(3) The plan is sufficient to ensure that the utility will 3160
not extend any undue preference or advantage to any affiliate, 3161
division, or part of its own business engaged in the business of 3162
supplying the competitive retail electric service or nonelectric 3163
product or service, including, but not limited to, utility 3164
resources such as trucks, tools, office equipment, office space, 3165
supplies, customer and marketing information, advertising, 3166
billing and mailing systems, personnel, and training, without 3167
compensation based upon fully loaded embedded costs charged to 3168
the affiliate; and to ensure that any such affiliate, division, 3169
or part will not receive undue preference or advantage from any 3170
affiliate, division, or part of the business engaged in business 3171
of supplying the noncompetitive retail electric service. No such 3172
utility, affiliate, division, or part shall extend such undue 3173
preference. Notwithstanding any other division of this section, 3174
a utility's obligation under division (A)(3) of this section 3175
shall be effective January 1, 2000. 3176
(B) The commission may approve, modify and approve, or 3177
Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 110
As Passed by the Senate
disapprove a corporate separation plan filed with the commission 3178
under division (A) of this section. As part of the code of 3179
conduct required under division (A)(1) of this section, the 3180
commission shall adopt rules pursuant to division (A) of section 3181

Section 136:
4928.06 of the Revised Code regarding corporate separation and 3182
procedures for plan filing and approval. The rules shall include 3183
limitations on affiliate practices solely for the purpose of 3184
maintaining a separation of the affiliate's business from the 3185
business of the utility to prevent unfair competitive advantage 3186
abuse of market power by virtue of that relationship. The rules 3187
also shall include an opportunity for any person having a real 3188
and substantial interest in the corporate separation plan to 3189
file specific objections to the plan and propose specific 3190
responses to issues raised in the objections, which objections 3191
and responses the commission shall address in its final order. 3192
Prior to commission approval of the plan, the commission shall 3193
afford a hearing upon those aspects of the plan that the 3194
commission determines reasonably require a hearing. The 3195
commission may reject and require refiling of a substantially 3196
inadequate plan under this section. 3197
(C) The commission shall issue an order approving or 3198
modifying and approving a corporate separation plan under this 3199

Section 137:
section, to be effective on the date specified in the order, 3200
only upon findings that the plan reasonably complies with the 3201
requirements of division (A) of this section and will provide 3202
for ongoing compliance with the policy specified in section 3203

Section 138:
4928.02 of the Revised Code. However, for good cause shown, the 3204
commission may issue an order approving or modifying and 3205
approving a corporate separation plan under this section that 3206
does not comply with division (A)(1) of this section but 3207
complies with such functional separation requirements as the 3208
Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 111
As Passed by the Senate
commission authorizes to apply for an interim period prescribed 3209
in the order, upon a finding that such alternative plan will 3210
provide for ongoing compliance with the policy specified in 3211

Section 139:
section 4928.02 of the Revised Code. 3212
(D) Any party may seek an amendment to a corporate 3213
separation plan approved under this section, and the commission, 3214
pursuant to a request from any party or on its own initiative, 3215
may order as it considers necessary the filing of an amended 3216
corporate separation plan to reflect changed circumstances. 3217
(E) No electric distribution utility shall sell or 3218
transfer any generating asset it wholly or partly owns at any 3219
time without obtaining prior commission approval. 3220
Sec. 4928.20. (A) The legislative authority of a municipal 3221
corporation may adopt an ordinance, or the board of township 3222
trustees of a township or the board of county commissioners of a 3223
county may adopt a resolution, under which, on or after the 3224
starting date of competitive retail electric service, it may 3225
aggregate in accordance with this section the retail electrical 3226
loads located, respectively, within the municipal corporation, 3227
township, or unincorporated area of the county and, for that 3228
purpose, may enter into service agreements to facilitate for 3229
those loads the sale and purchase of electricity. The 3230
legislative authority or board also may exercise such authority 3231
jointly with any other such legislative authority or board. For 3232
customers that are not mercantile customers, an ordinance or 3233
resolution under this division shall specify whether the 3234
aggregation will occur only with the prior, affirmative consent 3235
of each person owning, occupying, controlling, or using an 3236
electric load center proposed to be aggregated or will occur 3237
automatically for all such persons pursuant to the opt-out 3238
Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 112
As Passed by the Senate
requirements of division (D) of this section. The aggregation of 3239
mercantile customers shall occur only with the prior, 3240
affirmative consent of each such person owning, occupying, 3241
controlling, or using an electric load center proposed to be 3242
aggregated. Nothing in this division, however, authorizes the 3243
aggregation of the retail electric loads of an electric load 3244
center, as defined in section 4933.81 of the Revised Code, that 3245
is located in the certified territory of a nonprofit electric 3246
supplier under sections 4933.81 to 4933.90 of the Revised Code 3247
or an electric load center served by transmission or 3248
distribution facilities of a municipal electric utility. 3249
(B) If an ordinance or resolution adopted under division 3250
(A) of this section specifies that aggregation of customers that 3251
are not mercantile customers will occur automatically as 3252
described in that division, the ordinance or resolution shall 3253
direct the board of elections to submit the question of the 3254
authority to aggregate to the electors of the respective 3255
municipal corporation, township, or unincorporated area of a 3256
county at a special election on the day of the next primary or 3257
general election in the municipal corporation, township, or 3258
county. The legislative authority or board shall certify a copy 3259
of the ordinance or resolution to the board of elections not 3260
less than ninety days before the day of the special election. No 3261
ordinance or resolution adopted under division (A) of this 3262

Section 140:
section that provides for an election under this division shall 3263
take effect unless approved by a majority of the electors voting 3264
upon the ordinance or resolution at the election held pursuant 3265
to this division. 3266
(C) Upon the applicable requisite authority under 3267
divisions (A) and (B) of this section, the legislative authority 3268
or board shall develop a plan of operation and governance for 3269
Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 113
As Passed by the Senate
the aggregation program so authorized. Before adopting a plan 3270
under this division, the legislative authority or board shall 3271
hold at least two public hearings on the plan. Before the first 3272
hearing, the legislative authority or board shall publish notice 3273
of the hearings once a week for two consecutive weeks in a 3274
newspaper of general circulation in the jurisdiction or as 3275
provided in section 7.16 of the Revised Code. The notice shall 3276
summarize the plan and state the date, time, and location of 3277
each hearing. 3278
(D) No legislative authority or board, pursuant to an 3279
ordinance or resolution under divisions (A) and (B) of this 3280

Section 141:
section that provides for automatic aggregation of customers 3281
that are not mercantile customers as described in division (A) 3282
of this section, shall aggregate the electrical load of any 3283
electric load center located within its jurisdiction unless it 3284
in advance clearly discloses to the person owning, occupying, 3285
controlling, or using the load center that the person will be 3286
enrolled automatically in the aggregation program and will 3287
remain so enrolled unless the person affirmatively elects by a 3288
stated procedure not to be so enrolled. The disclosure shall 3289
state prominently the rates, charges, and other terms and 3290
conditions of enrollment. The stated procedure shall allow any 3291
person enrolled in the aggregation program the opportunity to 3292
opt out of the program every three years, without paying a 3293
switching fee. Any such person that opts out before the 3294
commencement of the aggregation program pursuant to the stated 3295
procedure shall default to the standard service offer provided 3296
under section 4928.14 or division (D) of section 4928.35 of the 3297
Revised Code until the person chooses an alternative supplier. 3298

(2) With respect to a governmental aggregation for a 3304
township or the unincorporated area of a county, which 3305
aggregation is authorized pursuant to divisions (A) to (D) of 3306
this section, resolutions may be proposed by initiative or 3307
referendum petitions in accordance with sections 731.28 to 3308

Section 143:

(a) The petitions shall be filed, respectively, with the 3310
township fiscal officer or the board of county commissioners, 3311
who shall perform those duties imposed under those sections upon 3312
the city auditor or village clerk. 3313
(b) The petitions shall contain the signatures of not less 3314
than ten per cent of the total number of electors in, 3315
respectively, the township or the unincorporated area of the 3316
county who voted for the office of governor at the preceding 3317
general election for that office in that area. 3318

market price and renewable energy resource amount shall be so 3391
assessed on the consumer shall be from the time the consumer so 3392
returns to the electric distribution utility until the 3393
expiration of the electric security plan. However, if that 3394
period of time is expected to be more than two years, the 3395
commission may reduce the time period to a period of not less 3396
than two years. 3397
(K) The commission shall adopt rules and issue orders in 3398
proceedings under sections 4928.141 and 4928.142 of the Revised 3399

difference between the costs attributable to the utility's 3734
transmission and distribution rates and charges under its 3735
schedule of rates and charges in effect on the effective date of 3736
this section, based upon the record in the most recent rate 3737
proceeding of the utility for which the utility's schedule was 3738
established, and the tariff rates for electric transmission 3739
service determined by the federal energy regulatory commission 3740
as described in division (A)(1) of this section. 3741

(3) All other unbundled components required by the 3742
commission in the rate unbundling plan equal the costs 3743
attributable to the particular service as reflected in the 3744
utility's schedule of rates and charges in effect on the 3745
effective date of this section. 3746
(4) The unbundled components for retail electric 3747
generation service in the rate unbundling plan equal the 3748
residual amount remaining after the determination of the 3749
transmission, distribution, and other unbundled components, and 3750
after any adjustments necessary to reflect the effects of the 3751
amendment of section 5727.111 of the Revised Code by Sub. S.B. 3752
No. 3 of the 123rd general assembly. 3753
(5) All unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan 3754
have been adjusted to reflect any base rate reductions on file 3755
with the commission and as scheduled to be in effect by December 3756
31, 2005, under rate settlements in effect on the effective date 3757
of this section. However, all earnings obligations, 3758

division, the rate cap applicable to a customer receiving 3776
electric service pursuant to an arrangement approved by the 3777
commission under section 4905.31 of the Revised Code is, for the 3778
term of the arrangement, the total of all rates and charges in 3779
effect under the arrangement. For any rate schedule filed 3780
pursuant to section 4905.30 of the Revised Code or any 3781
arrangement subject to approval pursuant to section 4905.31 of 3782
the Revised Code, the initial tax-related adjustment to the rate 3783
cap required by this division shall be equal to the rate of 3784
taxation specified in section 5727.81 of the Revised Code and 3785
applicable to the schedule or arrangement. To the extent such 3786
total annual amount of the tax-related adjustment is greater 3787
than or less than the comparable amount of the total annual tax 3788
reduction experienced by the electric utility as a result of the 3789
provisions of Sub. S.B. No. 3 of the 123rd general assembly, 3790
such difference shall be addressed by the commission through 3791
accounting procedures, refunds, or an annual surcharge or credit 3792
to customers, or through other appropriate means, to avoid 3793
placing the financial responsibility for the difference upon the 3794
electric utility or its shareholders. Any adjustments in the 3795
rate of taxation specified in section 5727.81 of the Revised 3796
Code section shall not occur without a corresponding adjustment 3797
to the rate cap for each such rate schedule or arrangement. The 3798
department of taxation shall advise the commission and self- 3799
assessors under section 5727.81 of the Revised Code prior to the 3800
effective date of any change in the rate of taxation specified 3801
under that section, and the commission shall modify the rate cap 3802
to reflect that adjustment so that the rate cap adjustment is 3803

(C)(1) The commission annually shall review an electric 3946
distribution utility's or electric services company's compliance 3947
with the most recent applicable benchmark under division (B)(2) 3948
of this section and, in the course of that review, shall 3949
identify any undercompliance or noncompliance of the utility or 3950
company that it determines is weather-related, related to 3951
equipment or resource shortages for qualifying renewable energy 3952
resources as applicable, or is otherwise outside the utility's 3953
or company's control. 3954
(2) Subject to the cost cap provisions of division (C)(3) 3955
of this section, if the commission determines, after notice and 3956
opportunity for hearing, and based upon its findings in that 3957
review regarding avoidable undercompliance or noncompliance, but 3958
subject to division (C)(4) of this section, that the utility or 3959
company has failed to comply with any such benchmark, the 3960
commission shall impose a renewable energy compliance payment on 3961
the utility or company. 3962
(a) The compliance payment pertaining to the solar energy 3963
resource benchmarks under division (B)(2) of this section shall 3964
be an amount per megawatt hour of undercompliance or 3965
noncompliance in the period under review, as follows: 3966
(i) Three hundred dollars for 2014, 2015, and 2016; 3967
(ii) Two hundred fifty dollars for 2017 and 2018; 3968
(iii) Two hundred dollars for 2019. 3969
(b) The compliance payment pertaining to the renewable 3970
energy resource benchmarks under division (B)(2) of this section 3971
shall equal the number of additional renewable energy credits 3972
that the electric distribution utility or electric services 3973
company would have needed to comply with the applicable 3974

benchmark in the period under review times an amount that shall 3975
begin at forty-five dollars and shall be adjusted annually by 3976
the commission to reflect any change in the consumer price index 3977
as defined in section 101.27 of the Revised Code, but shall not 3978
be less than forty-five dollars. As used in this division, 3979
"consumer price index" means the consumer price index prepared 3980
by the United States bureau of labor statistics (U.S. city 3981
average for urban wage earners and clerical workers: all items, 3982
1982-1984=100), or, if that index is no longer published, a 3983
generally available comparable index. 3984
(c) The compliance payment shall not be passed through by 3985
the electric distribution utility or electric services company 3986
to consumers. The compliance payment shall be remitted to the 3987
commission, for deposit to the credit of the advanced energy 3988
fund created under section 4928.61 of the Revised Code. Payment 3989
of the compliance payment shall be subject to such collection 3990
and enforcement procedures as apply to the collection of a 3991
forfeiture under sections 4905.55 to 4905.60 and 4905.64 of the 3992
Revised Code. 3993
(3) An electric distribution utility or an electric 3994
services company need not comply with a benchmark under division 3995
(B)(2) of this section to the extent that its reasonably 3996
expected cost of that compliance exceeds its reasonably expected 3997
cost of otherwise producing or acquiring the requisite 3998
electricity by three per cent or more. The cost of compliance 3999
shall be calculated as though any exemption from taxes and 4000
assessments had not been granted under section 5727.75 of the 4001
Revised Code. 4002

part of the utility's or company's compliance with any minimum 4006
benchmark under division (B)(2) of this section during the 4007
period of review occurring pursuant to division (C)(2) of this 4008

Section 174:
section. The commission may require the electric distribution 4009
utility or electric services company to make solicitations for 4010
renewable energy resource credits as part of its default service 4011
before the utility's or company's request of force majeure under 4012
this division can be made. 4013
(b) Within ninety days after the filing of a request by an 4014
electric distribution utility or electric services company under 4015
division (C)(4)(a) of this section, the commission shall 4016
determine if qualifying renewable energy resources are 4017
reasonably available in the marketplace in sufficient quantities 4018
for the utility or company to comply with the subject minimum 4019
benchmark during the review period. In making this 4020
determination, the commission shall consider whether the 4021
electric distribution utility or electric services company has 4022
made a good faith effort to acquire sufficient qualifying 4023
renewable energy or, as applicable, solar energy resources to so 4024
comply, including, but not limited to, by banking or seeking 4025
renewable energy resource credits or by seeking the resources 4026
through long-term contracts. Additionally, the commission shall 4027
consider the availability of qualifying renewable energy or 4028
solar energy resources in this state and other jurisdictions in 4029
the PJM interconnection regional transmission organization, 4030
L.L.C., or its successor and the midcontinent independent system 4031
operator or its successor. 4032

benchmark prescribed under division (B)(2) of this section, the 4038
commission shall modify that compliance obligation of the 4039
utility or company as it determines appropriate to accommodate 4040
the finding. Commission modification shall not automatically 4041
reduce the obligation for the electric distribution utility's or 4042
electric services company's compliance in subsequent years. If 4043
it modifies the electric distribution utility or electric 4044
services company obligation under division (C)(4)(c) of this 4045

Section 175:
section, the commission may require the utility or company, if 4046
sufficient renewable energy resource credits exist in the 4047
marketplace, to acquire additional renewable energy resource 4048
credits in subsequent years equivalent to the utility's or 4049
company's modified obligation under division (C)(4)(c) of this 4050

Section 176:
section. 4051
(5) The commission shall establish a process to provide 4052
for at least an annual review of the renewable energy resource 4053
market in this state and in the service territories of the 4054
regional transmission organizations that manage transmission 4055
systems located in this state. The commission shall use the 4056
results of this study to identify any needed changes to the 4057
amount of the renewable energy compliance payment specified 4058
under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of this section. Specifically, 4059
the commission may increase the amount to ensure that payment of 4060
compliance payments is not used to achieve compliance with this 4061

Section 177:
section in lieu of actually acquiring or realizing energy 4062
derived from qualifying renewable energy resources. However, if 4063
the commission finds that the amount of the compliance payment 4064
should be otherwise changed, the commission shall present this 4065
finding to the general assembly for legislative enactment. 4066

as defined in section 3706.40 of the Revised Code is not 4143
eligible to obtain a renewable energy credit under this section 4144
for any megawatt hour for which the resource has been issued a 4145
solar energy credit under section 3706.45 of the Revised Code. 4146
(D) Except for compressed natural gas that has been 4147
produced from biologically derived methane gas, energy generated 4148
by using natural gas as a resource is not eligible to obtain a 4149
renewable energy credit under this section. 4150

are to be fixed and determined. 1442
(c) The valuation so determined under division (A)(1) of 1443
this section for any public utility shall be the total value as 1444
set forth in division (C)(9)(B)(8) of section 4909.042 of the 1445
Revised Code and division (B)(9) of section 4909.05 of the 1446
Revised Code, and a reasonable allowance for materials and 1447
supplies and a reasonable allowance for cash working capital as 1448
determined by the commission. 1449
The commission, in its discretion, may include in the 1450
valuation a reasonable allowance for construction work in 1451
progress but, in no event, may such an allowance be made by the 1452
commission until it has determined that the particular 1453
construction project is at least seventy-five per cent complete. 1454
In determining the percentage completion of a particular 1455
construction project, the commission shall consider, among other 1456
relevant criteria, the per cent of time elapsed in construction; 1457
the per cent of construction funds, excluding allowance for 1458
funds used during construction, expended, or obligated to such 1459
construction funds budgeted where all such funds are adjusted to 1460
reflect current purchasing power; and any physical inspection 1461
performed by or on behalf of any party, including the 1462
commission's staff. 1463

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 52
As Passed by the Senate
Where the commission permits an allowance for construction 1468
work in progress, the dollar value of the project or portion 1469
thereof included in the valuation as construction work in 1470
progress shall not be included in the valuation as plant in 1471
service until such time as the total revenue effect of the 1472
construction work in progress allowance is offset by the total 1473
revenue effect of the plant in service exclusion. Carrying 1474
charges calculated in a manner similar to allowance for funds 1475
used during construction shall accrue on that portion of the 1476
project in service but not reflected in rates as plant in 1477
service, and such accrued carrying charges shall be included in 1478
the valuation of the property at the conclusion of the offset 1479
period for purposes of division (C)(9) of section 4909.05 of the 1480
Revised Code. 1481
From and after April 10, 1985, no allowance for 1482
construction work in progress as it relates to a particular 1483
construction project shall be reflected in rates for a period 1484
exceeding forty-eight consecutive months commencing on the date 1485
the initial rates reflecting such allowance become effective, 1486
except as otherwise provided in this division. 1487
The applicable maximum period in rates for an allowance 1488
for construction work in progress as it relates to a particular 1489
construction project shall be tolled if, and to the extent, a 1490
delay in the in-service date of the project is caused by the 1491
action or inaction of any federal, state, county, or municipal 1492
agency having jurisdiction, where such action or inaction 1493
relates to a change in a rule, standard, or approval of such 1494
agency, and where such action or inaction is not the result of 1495
the failure of the utility to reasonably endeavor to comply with 1496
any rule, standard, or approval prior to such change. 1497

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 53
As Passed by the Senate
In the event that such period expires before the project 1498
goes into service, the commission shall exclude, from the date 1499
of expiration, the allowance for the project as construction 1500
work in progress from rates, except that the commission may 1501
extend the expiration date up to twelve months for good cause 1502
shown. 1503
In the event that a utility has permanently canceled, 1504
abandoned, or terminated construction of a project for which it 1505
was previously permitted a construction work in progress 1506
allowance, the commission immediately shall exclude the 1507
allowance for the project from the valuation. 1508
In the event that a construction work in progress project 1509
previously included in the valuation is removed from the 1510
valuation pursuant to this division, any revenues collected by 1511
the utility from its customers after April 10, 1985, that 1512
resulted from such prior inclusion shall be offset against 1513
future revenues over the same period of time as the project was 1514
included in the valuation as construction work in progress. The 1515
total revenue effect of such offset shall not exceed the total 1516
revenues previously collected. 1517
In no event shall the total revenue effect of any offset 1518
or offsets provided under division (A)(1) of this section exceed 1519
the total revenue effect of any construction work in progress 1520
allowance. 1521
(2) A fair and reasonable rate of return to the utility on 1522
the valuation as determined in division (A)(1) of this section; 1523
(3) The dollar annual return to which the utility is 1524
entitled by applying the fair and reasonable rate of return as 1525
determined under division (A)(2) of this section to the 1526

utility service for the test period used for the determination 1530
under division (C)(1) of this section, less the total of any 1531
interest on cash or credit refunds paid, pursuant to section 1532
4909.42 of the Revised Code, by the utility during the test 1533
period. 1534
(a) Federal, state, and local taxes imposed on or measured 1535
by net income may, in the discretion of the commission, be 1536
computed by the normalization method of accounting, provided the 1537
utility maintains accounting reserves that reflect differences 1538
between taxes actually payable and taxes on a normalized basis, 1539
provided that no determination as to the treatment in the rate- 1540
making process of such taxes shall be made that will result in 1541
loss of any tax depreciation or other tax benefit to which the 1542
utility would otherwise be entitled, and further provided that 1543
such tax benefit as redounds to the utility as a result of such 1544
a computation may not be retained by the company, used to fund 1545
any dividend or distribution, or utilized for any purpose other 1546
than the defrayal of the operating expenses of the utility and 1547
the defrayal of the expenses of the utility in connection with 1548
construction work. 1549
(b) The amount of any tax credits granted to an electric 1550
light company under section 5727.391 of the Revised Code for 1551
Ohio coal burned prior to January 1, 2000, shall not be retained 1552
by the company, used to fund any dividend or distribution, or 1553
utilized for any purposes other than the defrayal of the 1554
allowable operating expenses of the company and the defrayal of 1555
the allowable expenses of the company in connection with the 1556

facility. The amount of the tax credits granted to an electric 1558
light company under that section for Ohio coal burned prior to 1559
January 1, 2000, shall be returned to its customers within three 1560
years after initially claiming the credit through an offset to 1561
the company's rates or fuel component, as determined by the 1562
commission, as set forth in schedules filed by the company under 1563
section 4905.30 of the Revised Code. As used in division (A)(4) 1564
(b) of this section, "compliance facility" has the same meaning 1565
as in section 5727.391 of the Revised Code. 1566
(B) The commission shall compute the gross annual revenues 1567
to which the utility is entitled by adding the dollar amount of 1568
return under division (A)(3) of this section to the cost, for 1569
the test period used for the determination under division (C)(1) 1570
of this section, of rendering the public utility service under 1571
division (A)(4) of this section. 1572
(C)(1) Except as provided in division (D) of this section, 1573
the revenues and expenses of the utility shall be determined 1574
during a test period. The utility may as follows: 1575
(a) Electric light companies may propose a forecasted test 1576
period. If the company proposes a forecasted test period, the 1577
company shall propose annual base rates for three consecutive 1578
twelve-month periods in a single forecasted test period 1579
application. 1580
During the first twelve-month period, the company shall 1581
propose a reasonably forecasted rate base using a thirteen-month 1582
average, revenues, and expenses for the first twelve months that 1583
new base rates will be in effect. 1584
During the second twelve-month period, the base rate 1585

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 56
As Passed by the Senate
revenue requirement shall be adjusted for the return of, and 1586
return on, incremental rate base additions approved by the 1587
commission in the initial application. During the third twelve- 1588
month period, the base rate revenue requirement shall be 1589
adjusted for the return of and return on incremental rate base 1590
additions approved by the commission in the initial application. 1591
For each twelve-month period, forecasted plant investment, 1592
forecasted revenues, and forecasted expenses versus actual 1593
investment, actual revenues, and actual expenses shall be trued 1594
up via a cost recovery mechanism approved by the commission. 1595
Each true-up process shall include an adjustment to actual 1596
for the rate of return that the company is authorized to earn on 1597
the actual investments made. The company shall provide the 1598
commission with actual financial information during the true-up 1599
process to ensure accuracy. As part of the true-up process, the 1600

utility's first standard service offer application at minimum 2867
shall include a filing under section 4928.143 of the Revised 2868
Code. Only Except as provided in division (A)(2) of this 2869
section, a standard service offer authorized in accordance with 2870
section 4928.142 or 4928.143 of the Revised Code, shall serve as 2871
the utility's standard service offer for the purpose of 2872
compliance with this section;, and that standard service offer 2873
shall serve as the utility's default standard service offer for 2874
the purpose of section 4928.14 of the Revised Code. 2875
Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, the rate 2876

prior to the amendments to this section by this act shall 2880
continue for the purpose of the utility's compliance with this 2881
division (A)(1) of this section until a standard service offer 2882
is first authorized to be effective under section 4928.142 or 2883
4928.143 of the Revised Code, and, as applicable, pursuant to 2884
division (D) of section 4928.143 of the Revised Code, any rate . 2885
Each security plan that extends approved before the effective 2886
date of the amendments to this section by this act shall extend 2887
beyond December 31, 2008, shall continue to be in effect for the 2888
subject electric distribution utility for the duration of the 2889
plan's termthrough the final standard service offer auction 2890
delivery period approved by the public utilities commission 2891
under the plan as of the effective date of the amendments to 2892
this section by this act and thereafter shall terminate. 2893
(3) A standard service offer under section 4928.142 or 2894
4928.143 of the Revised Code shall exclude any previously 2895
authorized allowances for transition costs, with such exclusion 2896
being effective on and after the date that the allowance is 2897
scheduled to end under the utility's rate electric security 2898
plan. 2899
(B) The commission shall set the time for hearing of a 2900
filing under section 4928.142 or 4928.143 of the Revised Code, 2901
send written notice of the hearing to the electric distribution 2902
utility, and publish notice in a newspaper of general 2903
circulation in each county in the utility's certified territory. 2904
The commission shall adopt rules regarding filings under those 2905
sections the section. 2906
Sec. 4928.142. (A) For the purpose of complying with 2907
section 4928.141 of the Revised Code and subject to division (D) 2908
of this section and, as applicable, subject to the rate plan 2909

requirement requirements of division (A) of section 4928.141 of 2910
the Revised Code, an electric distribution utility may shall 2911
establish a standard service offer price for retail electric 2912
generation service that is delivered to the utility under a 2913
market-rate offer. 2914
(1) The market-rate offer shall be determined through a 2915
competitive bidding process that provides for all of the 2916
following: 2917
(a) Open, fair, and transparent competitive solicitation; 2918
(b) Clear product definition; 2919
(c) Standardized bid evaluation criteria; 2920
(d) Oversight by an independent third party that shall 2921
design the solicitation, administer the bidding, and ensure that 2922
the criteria specified in division divisions (A)(1)(a) to (c) of 2923
this section are met; 2924
(e) Evaluation of the submitted bids prior to the 2925
selection of the least-cost bid winner or winners. 2926
No generation supplier shall be prohibited from 2927
participating in the bidding process. 2928
(2) The public utilities commission shall modify rules, or 2929
adopt new rules as necessary, concerning the conduct of the 2930
competitive bidding process and the qualifications of bidders, 2931
which rules shall foster supplier participation in the bidding 2932
process and shall be consistent with the requirements of 2933
division (A)(1) of this section. 2934
(B) Prior to initiating a competitive bidding process for 2935
a market-rate offer under division (A) of this section, the 2936
electric distribution utility shall file an application with the 2937

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 102
As Passed by the Senate
commission. An electric distribution utility may file its 2938
application with the commission prior to the effective date of 2939
the commission rules required under division (A)(2) of this 2940
section, and, as the commission determines necessary, the 2941
utility shall immediately conform its filing to the rules upon 2942
their taking effect. 2943
An application under this division shall detail the 2944
electric distribution utility's proposed compliance with the 2945
requirements of division (A)(1) of this section and with 2946
commission rules under division (A)(2) of this section and 2947
demonstrate that all of the following requirements are met: 2948
(1) The electric distribution utility or its transmission 2949
service affiliate belongs to at least one regional transmission 2950
organization that has been approved by the federal energy 2951
regulatory commission; or there otherwise is comparable and 2952
nondiscriminatory access to the electric transmission grid. 2953
(2) Any such regional transmission organization has a 2954
market-monitor function and the ability to take actions to 2955
identify and mitigate market power or the electric distribution 2956
utility's market conduct; or a similar market monitoring 2957
function exists with commensurate ability to identify and 2958
monitor market conditions and mitigate conduct associated with 2959
the exercise of market power. 2960
(3) A published source of information is available 2961
publicly or through subscription that identifies pricing 2962
information for traded electricity on- and off-peak energy 2963
products that are contracts for delivery beginning at least two 2964
years from the date of the publication and is updated on a 2965
regular basis. 2966

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 103
As Passed by the Senate
The commission shall initiate a proceeding and, within 2967
ninety days after the application's filing date, shall determine 2968
by order whether the electric distribution utility and its 2969
market-rate offer meet all of the foregoing requirements. If the 2970
finding is positive, the electric distribution utility may shall 2971
initiate its competitive bidding process. If the finding is 2972
negative as to one or more requirements, the commission in the 2973
order shall direct the electric distribution utility regarding 2974
how any deficiency may shall be timely remedied in a timely 2975
manner to the commission's satisfaction; otherwise, the electric 2976
distribution utility shall withdraw the application. However, if 2977
such remedy is made and the subsequent finding is positive and 2978
also if the electric distribution utility made a simultaneous 2979
filing under this section and section 4928.143 of the Revised 2980
Code, the utility shall not initiate its competitive bid until 2981
at least one hundred fifty days after the filing date of those 2982
applications. 2983
(C) Upon the completion of the competitive bidding process 2984
authorized by divisions (A) and (B) of this section, including 2985
for the purpose of division (D) of this section, the commission 2986
shall select the least-cost bid winner or winners of that 2987
process, and such selected bid or bids, as prescribed as retail 2988
rates by the commission, shall be the electric distribution 2989
utility's standard service offer unless the commission, by order 2990
issued before the third calendar day following the conclusion of 2991
the competitive bidding process for the market rate offer, 2992
determines that one or more of the following criteria were not 2993
met: 2994
(1) Each portion of the bidding process was 2995
oversubscribed, such that the amount of supply bid upon was 2996
greater than the amount of the load bid out. 2997

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 104
As Passed by the Senate
(2) There were four or more bidders. 2998
(3) At least twenty-five per cent of the load is bid upon 2999
by one or more persons other than the electric distribution 3000
utility. 3001
All costs incurred by the electric distribution utility as 3002
a result of or related to the competitive bidding process or to 3003
procuring generation service to provide the standard service 3004
offer, including the costs of energy and capacity and the costs 3005
of all other products and services procured as a result of the 3006
competitive bidding process, shall be timely recovered through 3007
the standard service offer price, and, for that purpose, the 3008
commission shall approve a reconciliation mechanism, other 3009
recovery mechanism, or a combination of such mechanisms for the 3010
utility. 3011
(D) The first application filed under this section by an 3012
electric distribution utility that, as of July 31, 2008, 3013
directly owns, in whole or in part, operating electric 3014
generating facilities that had been used and useful in this 3015
state shall require that a portion of that the utility's 3016
standard service offer load for the first five years of the 3017
market rate offer be competitively bid under division (A) of 3018
this section as follows: ten per cent of the load in year one, 3019
not more than twenty per cent in year two, thirty per cent in 3020
year three, forty per cent in year four, and fifty per cent in 3021
year five. Consistent with those percentages, the commission 3022
shall determine the actual percentages for each year of years 3023
one through five. The standard service offer price for retail 3024
electric generation service under this first application shall 3025
be a proportionate blend of the bid price and the generation 3026
service price for the remaining standard service offer load, 3027

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 105
As Passed by the Senate
which latter price shall be equal to the electric distribution 3028
utility's most recent standard service offer price, adjusted 3029
upward or downward as the commission determines reasonable, 3030
relative to the jurisdictional portion of any known and 3031
measurable changes from the level of any one or more of the 3032
following costs as reflected in that most recent standard 3033
service offer price: 3034
(1) The electric distribution utility's prudently incurred 3035
cost of fuel used to produce electricity; 3036
(2) Its prudently incurred purchased power costs; 3037
(3) Its prudently incurred costs of satisfying the supply 3038
and demand portfolio requirements of this state, including, but 3039
not limited to, renewable energy resource and energy efficiency 3040
requirements; 3041
(4) Its costs prudently incurred to comply with 3042
environmental laws and regulations, with consideration of the 3043
derating of any facility associated with those costs. 3044
In making any adjustment to the most recent standard 3045
service offer price on the basis of costs described in division 3046
(D) of this section, the commission shall include the benefits 3047
that may become available to the electric distribution utility 3048
as a result of or in connection with the costs included in the 3049
adjustment, including, but not limited to, the utility's receipt 3050
of emissions credits or its receipt of tax benefits or of other 3051
benefits, and, accordingly, the commission may impose such 3052
conditions on the adjustment to ensure that any such benefits 3053
are properly aligned with the associated cost responsibility. 3054
The commission shall also determine how such adjustments will 3055
affect the electric distribution utility's return on common 3056

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 106
As Passed by the Senate
equity that may be achieved by those adjustments. The commission 3057
shall not apply its consideration of the return on common equity 3058
to reduce any adjustments authorized under this division unless 3059
the adjustments will cause the electric distribution utility to 3060
earn a return on common equity that is significantly in excess 3061
of the return on common equity that is earned by publicly traded 3062
companies, including utilities, that face comparable business 3063
and financial risk, with such adjustments for capital structure 3064
as may be appropriate. The burden of proof for demonstrating 3065
that significantly excessive earnings will not occur shall be on 3066
the electric distribution utility. 3067
Additionally, the commission may adjust the electric 3068
distribution utility's most recent standard service offer price 3069
by such just and reasonable amount that the commission 3070
determines necessary to address any emergency that threatens the 3071
utility's financial integrity or to ensure that the resulting 3072
revenue available to the utility for providing the standard 3073
service offer is not so inadequate as to result, directly or 3074
indirectly, in a taking of property without compensation 3075
pursuant to Section 19 of Article I, Ohio Constitution. The 3076
electric distribution utility has the burden of demonstrating 3077
that any adjustment to its most recent standard service offer 3078
price is proper in accordance with this division. 3079
(E) Beginning in the second year of a blended price under 3080
division (D) of this section and notwithstanding any other 3081
requirement of this section, the commission may alter 3082
prospectively the proportions specified in that division to 3083
mitigate any effect of an abrupt or significant change in the 3084
electric distribution utility's standard service offer price 3085
that would otherwise result in general or with respect to any 3086
rate group or rate schedule but for such alteration. Any such 3087

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 107
As Passed by the Senate
alteration shall be made not more often than annually, and the 3088
commission shall not, by altering those proportions and in any 3089
event, including because of the length of time, as authorized 3090
under division (C) of this section, taken to approve the market 3091
rate offer, cause the duration of the blending period to exceed 3092
ten years as counted from the effective date of the approved 3093
market rate offer. Additionally, any such alteration shall be 3094
limited to an alteration affecting the prospective proportions 3095
used during the blending period and shall not affect any 3096
blending proportion previously approved and applied by the 3097
commission under this division. 3098
(F) An electric distribution utility that has received 3099
commission approval of its first application under division (C) 3100
of this section shall not, nor ever shall be authorized or 3101
required by the commission to, file an application under section 3102
4928.143 of the Revised Code. 3103
Sec. 4928.144. The public utilities commission by order 3104
may authorize any just and reasonable phase-in of any electric 3105
distribution utility rate or price established under sections 3106
4928.141 to 4928.143 and 4928.142 of the Revised Code, and 3107
inclusive of carrying charges, as the commission considers 3108
necessary to ensure rate or price stability for consumers. If 3109
the commission's order includes such a phase-in, the order also 3110
shall provide for the creation of regulatory assets pursuant to 3111
generally accepted accounting principles, by authorizing the 3112
deferral of incurred costs equal to the amount not collected, 3113
plus carrying charges on that amount. Further, the order shall 3114
authorize the collection of those deferrals through a 3115
nonbypassable surcharge on any such rate or price so established 3116
for the electric distribution utility by the commission. 3117

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 108
As Passed by the Senate
Sec. 4928.149. No electric distribution utility may use 3118
any electric energy storage system to participate in the 3119
wholesale market, if the utility purchased or acquired that 3120
system for distribution service. 3121
Sec. 4928.1410. If an electric distribution utility has a n 3122
existing electric security plan under which the commission had 3123
authorized the creation or continuation of riders, then, to the 3124
extent those riders will cease to exist after termination of the 3125
electric security plan, the electric distribution utility is 3126
authorized to create necessary regulatory assets or liabilities, 3127
along with carrying costs at the utility's weighted average cost 3128
of debt, for the resolution of any outstanding under-collection 3129
or over-collection of funds under such riders. The resolution of 3130
such regulatory assets or liabilities shall be addressed in the 3131
first distribution rate case under section 4909.18 of the 3132
Revised Code that occurs after the plan's expiration. 3133
Sec. 4928.17. (A) Except as otherwise provided in sections 3134
4928.141 or 4928.142 or 4928.143 or 4928.31 to 4928.40 of the 3135
Revised Code and beginning on the starting date of competitive 3136
retail electric service, no electric utility shall engage in 3137
this state, either directly or through an affiliate, in the 3138
businesses of supplying a noncompetitive retail electric service 3139
and supplying a competitive retail electric service, or in the 3140
businesses of supplying a noncompetitive retail electric service 3141
and supplying a product or service other than retail electric 3142
service, unless the utility implements and operates under a 3143
corporate separation plan that is approved by the public 3144
utilities commission under this section, is consistent with the 3145
policy specified in section 4928.02 of the Revised Code, and 3146
achieves all of the following: 3147

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 109
As Passed by the Senate
(1) The plan provides, at minimum, for the provision of 3148
the competitive retail electric service or the nonelectric 3149
product or service through a fully separated affiliate of the 3150
utility, and the plan includes separate accounting requirements, 3151
the code of conduct as ordered by the commission pursuant to a 3152
rule it shall adopt under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the 3153
Revised Code, and such other measures as are necessary to 3154
effectuate the policy specified in section 4928.02 of the 3155
Revised Code. 3156
(2) The plan satisfies the public interest in preventing 3157
unfair competitive advantage and preventing the abuse of market 3158
power. 3159
(3) The plan is sufficient to ensure that the utility will 3160
not extend any undue preference or advantage to any affiliate, 3161
division, or part of its own business engaged in the business of 3162
supplying the competitive retail electric service or nonelectric 3163
product or service, including, but not limited to, utility 3164
resources such as trucks, tools, office equipment, office space, 3165
supplies, customer and marketing information, advertising, 3166
billing and mailing systems, personnel, and training, without 3167
compensation based upon fully loaded embedded costs charged to 3168
the affiliate; and to ensure that any such affiliate, division, 3169
or part will not receive undue preference or advantage from any 3170
affiliate, division, or part of the business engaged in business 3171
of supplying the noncompetitive retail electric service. No such 3172
utility, affiliate, division, or part shall extend such undue 3173
preference. Notwithstanding any other division of this section, 3174
a utility's obligation under division (A)(3) of this section 3175
shall be effective January 1, 2000. 3176
(B) The commission may approve, modify and approve, or 3177

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 110
As Passed by the Senate
disapprove a corporate separation plan filed with the commission 3178
under division (A) of this section. As part of the code of 3179
conduct required under division (A)(1) of this section, the 3180
commission shall adopt rules pursuant to division (A) of section 3181
4928.06 of the Revised Code regarding corporate separation and 3182
procedures for plan filing and approval. The rules shall include 3183
limitations on affiliate practices solely for the purpose of 3184
maintaining a separation of the affiliate's business from the 3185
business of the utility to prevent unfair competitive advantage 3186
abuse of market power by virtue of that relationship. The rules 3187
also shall include an opportunity for any person having a real 3188
and substantial interest in the corporate separation plan to 3189
file specific objections to the plan and propose specific 3190
responses to issues raised in the objections, which objections 3191
and responses the commission shall address in its final order. 3192
Prior to commission approval of the plan, the commission shall 3193
afford a hearing upon those aspects of the plan that the 3194
commission determines reasonably require a hearing. The 3195
commission may reject and require refiling of a substantially 3196
inadequate plan under this section. 3197
(C) The commission shall issue an order approving or 3198
modifying and approving a corporate separation plan under this 3199
section, to be effective on the date specified in the order, 3200
only upon findings that the plan reasonably complies with the 3201
requirements of division (A) of this section and will provide 3202
for ongoing compliance with the policy specified in section 3203
4928.02 of the Revised Code. However, for good cause shown, the 3204
commission may issue an order approving or modifying and 3205
approving a corporate separation plan under this section that 3206
does not comply with division (A)(1) of this section but 3207
complies with such functional separation requirements as the 3208

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 111
As Passed by the Senate
commission authorizes to apply for an interim period prescribed 3209
in the order, upon a finding that such alternative plan will 3210
provide for ongoing compliance with the policy specified in 3211
section 4928.02 of the Revised Code. 3212
(D) Any party may seek an amendment to a corporate 3213
separation plan approved under this section, and the commission, 3214
pursuant to a request from any party or on its own initiative, 3215
may order as it considers necessary the filing of an amended 3216
corporate separation plan to reflect changed circumstances. 3217
(E) No electric distribution utility shall sell or 3218
transfer any generating asset it wholly or partly owns at any 3219
time without obtaining prior commission approval. 3220
Sec. 4928.20. (A) The legislative authority of a municipal 3221
corporation may adopt an ordinance, or the board of township 3222
trustees of a township or the board of county commissioners of a 3223
county may adopt a resolution, under which, on or after the 3224
starting date of competitive retail electric service, it may 3225
aggregate in accordance with this section the retail electrical 3226
loads located, respectively, within the municipal corporation, 3227
township, or unincorporated area of the county and, for that 3228
purpose, may enter into service agreements to facilitate for 3229
those loads the sale and purchase of electricity. The 3230
legislative authority or board also may exercise such authority 3231
jointly with any other such legislative authority or board. For 3232
customers that are not mercantile customers, an ordinance or 3233
resolution under this division shall specify whether the 3234
aggregation will occur only with the prior, affirmative consent 3235
of each person owning, occupying, controlling, or using an 3236
electric load center proposed to be aggregated or will occur 3237
automatically for all such persons pursuant to the opt-out 3238

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 112
As Passed by the Senate
requirements of division (D) of this section. The aggregation of 3239
mercantile customers shall occur only with the prior, 3240
affirmative consent of each such person owning, occupying, 3241
controlling, or using an electric load center proposed to be 3242
aggregated. Nothing in this division, however, authorizes the 3243
aggregation of the retail electric loads of an electric load 3244
center, as defined in section 4933.81 of the Revised Code, that 3245
is located in the certified territory of a nonprofit electric 3246
supplier under sections 4933.81 to 4933.90 of the Revised Code 3247
or an electric load center served by transmission or 3248
distribution facilities of a municipal electric utility. 3249
(B) If an ordinance or resolution adopted under division 3250
(A) of this section specifies that aggregation of customers that 3251
are not mercantile customers will occur automatically as 3252
described in that division, the ordinance or resolution shall 3253
direct the board of elections to submit the question of the 3254
authority to aggregate to the electors of the respective 3255
municipal corporation, township, or unincorporated area of a 3256
county at a special election on the day of the next primary or 3257
general election in the municipal corporation, township, or 3258
county. The legislative authority or board shall certify a copy 3259
of the ordinance or resolution to the board of elections not 3260
less than ninety days before the day of the special election. No 3261
ordinance or resolution adopted under division (A) of this 3262
section that provides for an election under this division shall 3263
take effect unless approved by a majority of the electors voting 3264
upon the ordinance or resolution at the election held pursuant 3265
to this division. 3266
(C) Upon the applicable requisite authority under 3267
divisions (A) and (B) of this section, the legislative authority 3268
or board shall develop a plan of operation and governance for 3269

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 113
As Passed by the Senate
the aggregation program so authorized. Before adopting a plan 3270
under this division, the legislative authority or board shall 3271
hold at least two public hearings on the plan. Before the first 3272
hearing, the legislative authority or board shall publish notice 3273
of the hearings once a week for two consecutive weeks in a 3274
newspaper of general circulation in the jurisdiction or as 3275
provided in section 7.16 of the Revised Code. The notice shall 3276
summarize the plan and state the date, time, and location of 3277
each hearing. 3278
(D) No legislative authority or board, pursuant to an 3279
ordinance or resolution under divisions (A) and (B) of this 3280
section that provides for automatic aggregation of customers 3281
that are not mercantile customers as described in division (A) 3282
of this section, shall aggregate the electrical load of any 3283
electric load center located within its jurisdiction unless it 3284
in advance clearly discloses to the person owning, occupying, 3285
controlling, or using the load center that the person will be 3286
enrolled automatically in the aggregation program and will 3287
remain so enrolled unless the person affirmatively elects by a 3288
stated procedure not to be so enrolled. The disclosure shall 3289
state prominently the rates, charges, and other terms and 3290
conditions of enrollment. The stated procedure shall allow any 3291
person enrolled in the aggregation program the opportunity to 3292
opt out of the program every three years, without paying a 3293
switching fee. Any such person that opts out before the 3294

market price and renewable energy resource amount shall be so 3391
assessed on the consumer shall be from the time the consumer so 3392
returns to the electric distribution utility until the 3393
expiration of the electric security plan. However, if that 3394
period of time is expected to be more than two years, the 3395
commission may reduce the time period to a period of not less 3396
than two years. 3397
(K) The commission shall adopt rules and issue orders in 3398
proceedings under sections 4928.141 and 4928.142 of the Revised 3399
Code to encourage and promote large-scale governmental 3400

on large-scale governmental aggregation of any nonbypassable 3408
generation charges, however collected, that would be established 3409
under that plan, except any nonbypassable generation charges 3410
that relate to any cost incurred by the review each application 3411
filed under section 4928.142 of the Revised Code by an electric 3412
distribution utility, to ensure that the deferral of which has 3413
been authorized by the commission prior to the effective date of 3414

bonds have been established, and prior to the issuance of those 3707
bonds, the electric distribution utility shall determine the 3708
resulting phase-in-recovery charges in accordance with the 3709
adjustment mechanism described in the financing order. These 3710
phase-in-recovery charges shall be final and effective upon the 3711

Sec. 4928.34. (A) The public utilities commission shall 3714
not approve or prescribe a transition plan under division (A) or 3715
(B) of section 4928.33 of the Revised Code unless the commission 3716
first makes all of the following determinations: 3717
(1) The unbundled components for the electric transmission 3718
component of retail electric service, as specified in the 3719
utility's rate unbundling plan required by division (A)(1) of 3720
section 4928.31 of the Revised Code, equal the tariff rates 3721
determined by the federal energy regulatory commission that are 3722
in effect on the date of the approval of the transition plan 3723
under sections 4928.31 to 4928.40 of the Revised Code, as each 3724
such rate is determined applicable to each particular customer 3725
class and rate schedule by the commission. The unbundled 3726
transmission component shall include a sliding scale of charges 3727
under division (B) of section 4905.31 of the Revised Code to 3728
ensure that refunds determined or approved by the federal energy 3729
regulatory commission are flowed through to retail electric 3730
customers. 3731
(2) The unbundled components for retail electric 3732
distribution service in the rate unbundling plan equal the 3733
difference between the costs attributable to the utility's 3734
transmission and distribution rates and charges under its 3735
schedule of rates and charges in effect on the effective date of 3736
this section, based upon the record in the most recent rate 3737
proceeding of the utility for which the utility's schedule was 3738
established, and the tariff rates for electric transmission 3739
service determined by the federal energy regulatory commission 3740
as described in division (A)(1) of this section. 3741

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 129
As Passed by the Senate
(3) All other unbundled components required by the 3742
commission in the rate unbundling plan equal the costs 3743
attributable to the particular service as reflected in the 3744
utility's schedule of rates and charges in effect on the 3745
effective date of this section. 3746
(4) The unbundled components for retail electric 3747
generation service in the rate unbundling plan equal the 3748
residual amount remaining after the determination of the 3749
transmission, distribution, and other unbundled components, and 3750
after any adjustments necessary to reflect the effects of the 3751
amendment of section 5727.111 of the Revised Code by Sub. S.B. 3752
No. 3 of the 123rd general assembly. 3753
(5) All unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan 3754
have been adjusted to reflect any base rate reductions on file 3755
with the commission and as scheduled to be in effect by December 3756
31, 2005, under rate settlements in effect on the effective date 3757
of this section. However, all earnings obligations, 3758
restrictions, or caps imposed on an electric utility in a 3759
commission order prior to the effective date of this section are 3760
void. 3761
(6) Subject to division (A)(5) of this section, the total 3762
of all unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan are 3763
capped and shall equal during the market development period, 3764
except as specifically provided in this chapter, the total of 3765
all rates and charges in effect under the applicable bundled 3766
schedule of the electric utility pursuant to section 4905.30 of 3767
the Revised Code in effect on the day before the effective date 3768
of this section, including the transition charge determined 3769
under section 4928.40 of the Revised Code, adjusted for any 3770
changes in the taxation of electric utilities and retail 3771

electric service under Sub. S.B. No. 3 of the 123rd General 3772
Assembly, the universal service rider authorized by section 3773
4928.51 of the Revised Code, and the temporary rider authorized 3774
by section 4928.61 of the Revised Code. For the purpose of this 3775
division, the rate cap applicable to a customer receiving 3776
electric service pursuant to an arrangement approved by the 3777
commission under section 4905.31 of the Revised Code is, for the 3778
term of the arrangement, the total of all rates and charges in 3779
effect under the arrangement. For any rate schedule filed 3780
pursuant to section 4905.30 of the Revised Code or any 3781
arrangement subject to approval pursuant to section 4905.31 of 3782
the Revised Code, the initial tax-related adjustment to the rate 3783
cap required by this division shall be equal to the rate of 3784
taxation specified in section 5727.81 of the Revised Code and 3785
applicable to the schedule or arrangement. To the extent such 3786
total annual amount of the tax-related adjustment is greater 3787
than or less than the comparable amount of the total annual tax 3788
reduction experienced by the electric utility as a result of the 3789
provisions of Sub. S.B. No. 3 of the 123rd general assembly, 3790
such difference shall be addressed by the commission through 3791
accounting procedures, refunds, or an annual surcharge or credit 3792
to customers, or through other appropriate means, to avoid 3793
placing the financial responsibility for the difference upon the 3794
electric utility or its shareholders. Any adjustments in the 3795
rate of taxation specified in section 5727.81 of the Revised 3796
Code section shall not occur without a corresponding adjustment 3797
to the rate cap for each such rate schedule or arrangement. The 3798
department of taxation shall advise the commission and self- 3799
assessors under section 5727.81 of the Revised Code prior to the 3800
effective date of any change in the rate of taxation specified 3801
under that section, and the commission shall modify the rate cap 3802
to reflect that adjustment so that the rate cap adjustment is 3803

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 131
As Passed by the Senate
effective as of the effective date of the change in the rate of 3804
taxation. This division shall be applied, to the extent 3805
possible, to eliminate any increase in the price of electricity 3806
for customers that otherwise may occur as a result of 3807
establishing the taxes contemplated in section 5727.81 of the 3808
Revised Code. 3809
(7) The rate unbundling plan complies with any rules 3810
adopted by the commission under division (A) of section 4928.06 3811
of the Revised Code. 3812
(8) The corporate separation plan required by division (A) 3813
(2) of section 4928.31 of the Revised Code complies with section 3814
4928.17 of the Revised Code and any rules adopted by the 3815
commission under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the Revised 3816
Code. 3817
(9) Any plan or plans the commission requires to address 3818
operational support systems and any other technical 3819
implementation issues pertaining to competitive retail electric 3820
service comply with any rules adopted by the commission under 3821
division (A) of section 4928.06 of the Revised Code. 3822
(10) The employee assistance plan required by division (A) 3823
(4) of section 4928.31 of the Revised Code sufficiently provides 3824
severance, retraining, early retirement, retention, 3825
outplacement, and other assistance for the utility's employees 3826
whose employment is affected by electric industry restructuring 3827
under this chapter. 3828
(11) The consumer education plan required under division 3829
(A)(5) of section 4928.31 of the Revised Code complies with 3830
former section 4928.42 of the Revised Code and any rules adopted 3831
by the commission under division (A) of section 4928.06 of the 3832

Revised Code. 3833
(12) The transition revenues for which an electric utility 3834
is authorized a revenue opportunity under sections 4928.31 to 3835
4928.40 of the Revised Code are the allowable transition costs 3836
of the utility as such costs are determined by the commission 3837
pursuant to section 4928.39 of the Revised Code, and the 3838
transition charges for the customer classes and rate schedules 3839
of the utility are the charges determined pursuant to section 3840
4928.40 of the Revised Code. 3841
(13) Any independent transmission plan included in the 3842
transition plan filed under section 4928.31 of the Revised Code 3843
reasonably complies with section 4928.12 of the Revised Code and 3844
any rules adopted by the commission under division (A) of 3845
section 4928.06 of the Revised Code, unless the commission, for 3846
good cause shown, authorizes the utility to defer compliance 3847
until an order is issued under division (G) of section 4928.35 3848
of the Revised Code. 3849
(14) The utility is in compliance with sections 4928.01 to 3850
4928.11 of the Revised Code and any rules or orders of the 3851
commission adopted or issued under those sections. 3852
(15) All unbundled components in the rate unbundling plan 3853
have been adjusted to reflect the elimination of the tax on 3854
gross receipts imposed by section 5727.30 of the Revised Code. 3855
In addition, a transition plan approved by the commission 3856
under section 4928.33 of the Revised Code but not containing an 3857
approved independent transmission plan shall contain the express 3858
conditions that the utility will comply with an order issued 3859

Revised Code, if If the commission finds that any part of the 3862
transition plan would constitute an abandonment under sections 3863
4905.20 and 4905.21 of the Revised Code, the commission shall 3864
not approve that part of the transition plan unless it makes the 3865
finding required for approval of an abandonment application 3866
under section 4905.21 of the Revised Code. Sections 4905.20 and 3867
4905.21 of the Revised Code otherwise shall not apply to a 3868
transition plan under sections 4928.31 to 4928.40 of the Revised 3869

energy resources obtained pursuant to an electricity supply 3919
contract, a portion of the electricity supply required for its 3920
standard service offer under section sections 4928.141 and 3921
4928.142 of the Revised Code, and an electric services company 3922
shall have provided a portion of its electricity supply for 3923
retail consumers in this state from qualifying renewable energy 3924
resources, including, at its discretion, qualifying renewable 3925
energy resources obtained pursuant to an electricity supply 3926
contract. That portion shall equal eight and one-half per cent 3927
of the total number of kilowatt hours of electricity sold by the 3928
subject utility or company to any and all retail electric 3929
consumers whose electric load centers are served by that utility 3930
and are located within the utility's certified territory or, in 3931
the case of an electric services company, are served by the 3932
company and are located within this state. However, nothing in 3933
this section precludes a utility or company from providing a 3934
greater percentage. 3935
(2) Subject to section 4928.642 of the Revised Code, the 3936
The portion required under division (B)(1) of this section shall 3937

As Passed by the Senate
(C)(1) The commission annually shall review an electric 3946
distribution utility's or electric services company's compliance 3947
with the most recent applicable benchmark under division (B)(2) 3948
of this section and, in the course of that review, shall 3949
identify any undercompliance or noncompliance of the utility or 3950
company that it determines is weather-related, related to 3951
equipment or resource shortages for qualifying renewable energy 3952
resources as applicable, or is otherwise outside the utility's 3953
or company's control. 3954
(2) Subject to the cost cap provisions of division (C)(3) 3955
of this section, if the commission determines, after notice and 3956
opportunity for hearing, and based upon its findings in that 3957
review regarding avoidable undercompliance or noncompliance, but 3958
subject to division (C)(4) of this section, that the utility or 3959
company has failed to comply with any such benchmark, the 3960
commission shall impose a renewable energy compliance payment on 3961
the utility or company. 3962
(a) The compliance payment pertaining to the solar energy 3963
resource benchmarks under division (B)(2) of this section shall 3964
be an amount per megawatt hour of undercompliance or 3965
noncompliance in the period under review, as follows: 3966
(i) Three hundred dollars for 2014, 2015, and 2016; 3967
(ii) Two hundred fifty dollars for 2017 and 2018; 3968
(iii) Two hundred dollars for 2019. 3969
(b) The compliance payment pertaining to the renewable 3970
energy resource benchmarks under division (B)(2) of this section 3971
shall equal the number of additional renewable energy credits 3972
that the electric distribution utility or electric services 3973
company would have needed to comply with the applicable 3974

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 138
As Passed by the Senate
benchmark in the period under review times an amount that shall 3975
begin at forty-five dollars and shall be adjusted annually by 3976
the commission to reflect any change in the consumer price index 3977
as defined in section 101.27 of the Revised Code, but shall not 3978
be less than forty-five dollars. As used in this division, 3979
"consumer price index" means the consumer price index prepared 3980
by the United States bureau of labor statistics (U.S. city 3981
average for urban wage earners and clerical workers: all items, 3982
1982-1984=100), or, if that index is no longer published, a 3983
generally available comparable index. 3984
(c) The compliance payment shall not be passed through by 3985
the electric distribution utility or electric services company 3986
to consumers. The compliance payment shall be remitted to the 3987
commission, for deposit to the credit of the advanced energy 3988
fund created under section 4928.61 of the Revised Code. Payment 3989
of the compliance payment shall be subject to such collection 3990
and enforcement procedures as apply to the collection of a 3991
forfeiture under sections 4905.55 to 4905.60 and 4905.64 of the 3992
Revised Code. 3993
(3) An electric distribution utility or an electric 3994
services company need not comply with a benchmark under division 3995
(B)(2) of this section to the extent that its reasonably 3996
expected cost of that compliance exceeds its reasonably expected 3997
cost of otherwise producing or acquiring the requisite 3998
electricity by three per cent or more. The cost of compliance 3999
shall be calculated as though any exemption from taxes and 4000
assessments had not been granted under section 5727.75 of the 4001
Revised Code. 4002
(4)(a) An electric distribution utility or electric 4003
services company may request the commission to make a force 4004

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 139
As Passed by the Senate
majeure determination pursuant to this division regarding all or 4005
part of the utility's or company's compliance with any minimum 4006
benchmark under division (B)(2) of this section during the 4007
period of review occurring pursuant to division (C)(2) of this 4008
section. The commission may require the electric distribution 4009
utility or electric services company to make solicitations for 4010
renewable energy resource credits as part of its default service 4011
before the utility's or company's request of force majeure under 4012
this division can be made. 4013
(b) Within ninety days after the filing of a request by an 4014
electric distribution utility or electric services company under 4015
division (C)(4)(a) of this section, the commission shall 4016
determine if qualifying renewable energy resources are 4017
reasonably available in the marketplace in sufficient quantities 4018
for the utility or company to comply with the subject minimum 4019
benchmark during the review period. In making this 4020
determination, the commission shall consider whether the 4021
electric distribution utility or electric services company has 4022
made a good faith effort to acquire sufficient qualifying 4023
renewable energy or, as applicable, solar energy resources to so 4024
comply, including, but not limited to, by banking or seeking 4025
renewable energy resource credits or by seeking the resources 4026
through long-term contracts. Additionally, the commission shall 4027
consider the availability of qualifying renewable energy or 4028
solar energy resources in this state and other jurisdictions in 4029
the PJM interconnection regional transmission organization, 4030
L.L.C., or its successor and the midcontinent independent system 4031
operator or its successor. 4032
(c) If, pursuant to division (C)(4)(b) of this section, 4033
the commission determines that qualifying renewable energy or 4034
solar energy resources are not reasonably available to permit 4035

Sub. H. B. No. 15 Page 140
As Passed by the Senate
the electric distribution utility or electric services company 4036
to comply, during the period of review, with the subject minimum 4037
benchmark prescribed under division (B)(2) of this section, the 4038
commission shall modify that compliance obligation of the 4039
utility or company as it determines appropriate to accommodate 4040
the finding. Commission modification shall not automatically 4041
reduce the obligation for the electric distribution utility's or 4042
electric services company's compliance in subsequent years. If 4043
it modifies the electric distribution utility or electric 4044
services company obligation under division (C)(4)(c) of this 4045
section, the commission may require the utility or company, if 4046
sufficient renewable energy resource credits exist in the 4047
marketplace, to acquire additional renewable energy resource 4048
credits in subsequent years equivalent to the utility's or 4049
company's modified obligation under division (C)(4)(c) of this 4050
section. 4051
(5) The commission shall establish a process to provide 4052
for at least an annual review of the renewable energy resource 4053
market in this state and in the service territories of the 4054
regional transmission organizations that manage transmission 4055
systems located in this state. The commission shall use the 4056
results of this study to identify any needed changes to the 4057
amount of the renewable energy compliance payment specified 4058
under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of this section. Specifically, 4059
the commission may increase the amount to ensure that payment of 4060
compliance payments is not used to achieve compliance with this 4061
section in lieu of actually acquiring or realizing energy 4062
derived from qualifying renewable energy resources. However, if 4063
the commission finds that the amount of the compliance payment 4064
should be otherwise changed, the commission shall present this 4065
finding to the general assembly for legislative enactment. 4066

As Passed by the Senate
(D) The commission annually shall submit to the general 4067
assembly in accordance with section 101.68 of the Revised Code a 4068
report describing all of the following: 4069
(1) The compliance of electric distribution utilities and 4070
electric services companies with division (B) of this section; 4071
(2) The average annual cost of renewable energy credits 4072
purchased by utilities and companies for the year covered in the 4073
report; 4074
(3) Any strategy for utility and company compliance or for 4075
encouraging the use of qualifying renewable energy resources in 4076
supplying this state's electricity needs in a manner that 4077
considers available technology, costs, job creation, and 4078
economic impacts. 4079
The commission shall begin providing the information 4080
described in division (D)(2) of this section in each report 4081
submitted after September 10, 2012. The commission shall allow 4082
and consider public comments on the report prior to its 4083
submission to the general assembly. Nothing in the report shall 4084
be binding on any person, including any utility or company for 4085
the purpose of its compliance with any benchmark under division 4086
(B) of this section, or the enforcement of that provision under 4087
division (C) of this section. 4088
(E) All costs incurred by an electric distribution utility 4089
in complying with the requirements of this section shall be 4090
bypassable by any consumer that has exercised choice of supplier 4091
under section 4928.03 of the Revised Code. 4092
Sec. 4928.645. (A) An electric distribution utility or 4093

project for which certification has been revoked is ineligible 5089
for further exemption under this section. Revocation does not 5090
affect the tax-exempt status of the project's tangible personal 5091
property for the tax year in which revocation occurs or any 5092
prior tax year. 5093
(C) Tangible personal property of a qualified energy 5094
project using clean coal technology, advanced nuclear 5095

division (E)(1)(b) or (c) of this section to approve the 5108
application submitted under division (E) of this section to 5109
exempt the property located in that county from taxation. A 5110
board's adoption of a resolution rejecting the application or 5111
its failure to adopt a resolution approving the application does 5112
not affect the tax-exempt status of the qualified energy 5113
project's property that is located in another county. 5114
(3) The certification for the qualified energy project 5115
issued under division (E)(2) of this section has not been 5116
revoked. An energy project for which certification has been 5117
revoked is ineligible for exemption under this section. 5118
Revocation does not affect the tax-exempt status of the 5119
project's tangible personal property for the tax year in which 5120
revocation occurs or any prior tax year. 5121
(D) Except as otherwise provided in this section, real 5122
property of a qualified energy project is exempt from taxation 5123
for any tax year for which the tangible personal property of the 5124
qualified energy project is exempted under this section. 5125
