Section 1:
(136th General Assembly)
(House Resolution Number 147)
A RESOLUTION
Ohio train derailment and the federal Environmental Protection Agency's
response to it.
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of Ohio:
WHEREAS, On February 3, 2023, a freight train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, while carrying
hazardous materials, including vinyl chloride, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, ethyl-hexyl acrylate,
butyl acrylates, benzene residue, and isobutylene. In response, officials evacuated a one-mile radius
around the derailment location and then extended it to two miles a few days later; and
WHEREAS, The force of the crash caused several rail cars to catch fire and others to spill their
toxic loads onto the soil, causing hazardous substances to travel into local waterways; and
WHEREAS, Emergency crews were forced to conduct controlled burns of five vinyl chloride tank
rail cars to limit potential explosions. But as a result of the controlled burning, plumes of black
smoke containing hazardous chemicals were released into the air; and
WHEREAS, In September 2023, President Biden issued Executive Order 14108, "ensuring the
people of East Palestine are protected now and in the future." This Executive Order also states, in
pertinent part, that "available data show that no contaminants of concern have been detected at levels
of concern in the air in the affected communities at sustained levels since the evacuation order was
lifted"; and
WHEREAS, The Executive Order also directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) to "oversee long-term recovery efforts in the affected communities and conduct a
comprehensive assessment of unmet needs of the affected communities in recovering from the
derailment beyond the cleanup work directed by EPA"; and
WHEREAS, Newly-obtained documents acquired through a Freedom of Information Act request
show that officials from FEMA voiced concerns that the chemical spill and the plume of smoke set
off by the controlled burn could cause "cancer clusters"; now therefore be it
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the House of Representatives of the 136th General
Assembly of the State of Ohio, in adopting this resolution, urge Congress to establish a special
committee to investigate the East Palestine train derailment and the United States Environmental
Protection Agency's response to it; and be it further
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the House of Representatives of the 136th General
Assembly of the State of Ohio, in adopting this resolution, urge Congress to appoint members of the
Ohio Congressional delegation to the special committee; and be it further
H. R. No. 147 136th G.A.

RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives transmit duly authenticated copies of
this resolution to the President of the United States, the Speaker and Clerk of the United States House
of Representatives, the President Pro Tempore and Secretary of the United States Senate, each
