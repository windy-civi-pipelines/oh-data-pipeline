WHEREAS, On February 3, 2023, a freight train derailed in 5
East Palestine, Ohio, while carrying hazardous materials, 6
including vinyl chloride, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, 7
ethyl-hexyl acrylate, butyl acrylates, benzene residue, and 8
isobutylene. In response, officials evacuated a one-mile radius 9
around the derailment location and then extended it to two miles 10
a few days later; and 11
WHEREAS, The force of the crash caused several rail cars to 12
catch fire and others to spill their toxic loads onto the soil, 13
causing hazardous substances to travel into local waterways; and 14
WHEREAS, Emergency crews were forced to conduct controlled 15
burns of five vinyl chloride tank rail cars to limit potential 16
explosions. But as a result of the controlled burning, plumes of 17
black smoke containing hazardous chemicals were released into 18

work directed by EPA"; and 32
WHEREAS, Newly-obtained documents acquired through a 33
