public employment covered by the agreement. If the agreement 114
provides for a final and binding arbitration of grievances, 115
public employers, employees, and employee organizations are 116

matters that were the subject of a final and binding grievance 120
procedure. Where no agreement exists or where an agreement makes 121

employees are subject to all applicable state or local laws or 123

3301.07 of the Revised Code. 144
(2) The law pertaining to the leave of absence and 145
compensation provided under section 5923.05 of the Revised Code, 146
if the terms of the agreement contain benefits which are less 147
than those contained in that section or the agreement contains 148
no such terms and the public authority is the state or any 149
agency, authority, commission, or board of the state or if the 150
public authority is another entity listed in division (B) of 151
section 4117.01 of the Revised Code that elects to provide leave 152
of absence and compensation as provided in section 5923.05 of 153
the Revised Code; 154

agreement contain benefits that are less than those contained in 157
section 5906.02 of the Revised Code; 158

Code that a peace officer or corrections officer submit to a 164
chemical test after an incident involving the use of force, as 165
defined in that section, and that the officer's employer report 166
the results and take appropriate corrective or disciplinary 167
actions. 168
Except for sections 306.08, 306.12, 306.35, and 4981.22 of 169
the Revised Code and arrangements entered into thereunder, and 170
section 4981.21 of the Revised Code as necessary to comply with 171
section 13(c) of the "Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964," 87 172
Stat. 295, 49 U.S.C.A. 1609(c), as amended, and arrangements 173
entered into thereunder, this chapter prevails over any and all 174
other conflicting laws, resolutions, provisions, present or 175
future, except as otherwise specified in this chapter or as 176
otherwise specified by the general assembly. Nothing in this 177
section prohibits or shall be construed to invalidate the 178
provisions of an agreement establishing supplemental workers' 179
compensation or unemployment compensation benefits or exceeding 180
minimum requirements contained in the Revised Code pertaining to 181

legislative body to the legislative body within fourteen days of 188
the date on which the parties finalize the agreement, unless 189
otherwise specified, but if the appropriate legislative body is 190
not in session at the time, then within fourteen days after it 191
convenes. The legislative body must approve or reject the 192
submission as a whole, and the submission is deemed approved if 193
the legislative body fails to act within thirty days after the 194

H. B. No. 548 Page 8
As Introduced
public employer submits the agreement. The parties may specify 195
that those provisions of the agreement not requiring action by a 196
legislative body are effective and operative in accordance with 197
the terms of the agreement, provided there has been compliance 198
with division (C) of this section. If the legislative body 199
rejects the submission of the public employer, either party may 200
reopen all or part of the entire agreement. 201
As used in this section, "legislative body" includes the 202
governing board of a municipal corporation, school district, 203
college or university, village, township, or board of county 204
commissioners or any other body that has authority to approve 205
the budget of their public jurisdiction and, with regard to the 206
state, "legislative body" means the controlling board. 207
(C) The chief executive officer, or the chief executive 208
officer's representative, of each municipal corporation, the 209
designated representative of the board of education of each 210
school district, college or university, or any other body that 211
has authority to approve the budget of their public 212
jurisdiction, the designated representative of the board of 213
county commissioners and of each elected officeholder of the 214

or the board of township trustees of each township is 217
responsible for negotiations in the collective bargaining 218
process; except that the legislative body may accept or reject a 219
proposed collective bargaining agreement. When the matters about 220
which there is agreement are reduced to writing and approved by 221
the employee organization and the legislative body, the 222
agreement is binding upon the legislative body, the employer, 223
and the employee organization and employees covered by the 224
agreement. 225

(D) There is hereby established an office of collective 226
bargaining in the department of administrative services for the 227
purpose of negotiating with and entering into written agreements 228
between state agencies, departments, boards, and commissions and 229
the exclusive representative on matters of wages, hours, terms 230
and other conditions of employment and the continuation, 231
modification, or deletion of an existing provision of a 232
collective bargaining agreement. Nothing in any provision of law 233
to the contrary shall be interpreted as excluding the bureau of 234
workers' compensation and the industrial commission from the 235
preceding sentence. This office shall not negotiate on behalf of 236
other statewide elected officials or boards of trustees of state 237
institutions of higher education who shall be considered as 238
separate public employers for the purposes of this chapter; 239
however, the office may negotiate on behalf of these officials 240
or trustees where authorized by the officials or trustees. The 241
staff of the office of collective bargaining are in the 242
unclassified service. The director of administrative services 243
shall fix the compensation of the staff. 244

philosophy for public collective bargaining as well as planning 247
bargaining strategies; 248
(2) Conduct negotiations with the exclusive 249

the Revised Code are hereby repealed. 263
Section 3. Section 1 of this act applies to collective 264
bargaining agreements entered into on or after the effective 265
date of this section. 266
Section 4. Section 3701.143 of the Revised Code is 267
presented in this act as a composite of the section as amended 268
by both H.B. 37 and S.B. 100 of the 135th General Assembly. The 269
General Assembly, applying the principle stated in division (B) 270
of section 1.52 of the Revised Code that amendments are to be 271
harmonized and reconciled if reasonably capable of simultaneous 272
operation, finds that the composite is the resulting version of 273
the section in effect prior to the effective date of the section 274
as presented in this act. 275
