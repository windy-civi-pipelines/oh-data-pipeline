of total service credit and disability coverage for on-duty 286
illness or injury to each member who is a PERS law enforcement 287

The coverage shall extend only to illness or injury that 290

in the case of illness or injury that results from contributing 292
service, becomes evident not later than two years after the date 293
the contributing service ends. The coverage shall not extend to 294

29, 1992, the opportunity to elect disability coverage either 299

election, accompanied by an explanation of the coverage under 302
each of the Revised Code sections and a form on which the 303
election is to be made, to each member at the member's last 304
known address. The board shall also provide the explanation and 305
form to any member on request. 306
Regardless of whether the member actually receives notice 307
of the right to make an election, a member who fails to file a 308

H. B. No. 73 Page 12
As Introduced
valid election under this section shall be considered to have 309
elected disability coverage under section 145.36 of the Revised 310

the board not later than one hundred eighty days after the date 313
the notice was mailed, or, in the case of a form provided at the 314
request of a member, a date specified by rule of the retirement 315
board. Once made, an election is irrevocable, but if the member 316
ceases to be a member of the retirement system, the election is 317
void. If a person who makes an election under this section also 318
makes an election under section 3307.62 or 3309.39 of the 319
Revised Code, the election made for the system that pays a 320
disability benefit to that person shall govern the benefit. 321

The retirement board may adopt rules governing elections 326
made under this division. 327
(C) Application for a disability benefit may be made by a 328
member, by a person acting in the member's behalf, or by the 329
member's employer, provided the member has disability coverage 330
under section 145.36 or 145.361 of the Revised Code and is not 331
receiving a disability benefit under any other Ohio state or 332
municipal retirement program. Application must be made within 333
two years from the date the member's contributing service under 334
the PERS defined benefit plan terminated or the date the member 335
ceased to make contributions to the PERS defined benefit plan 336
under section 145.814 of the Revised Code, unless the board's 337
medical consultant determines that the member's medical records 338

H. B. No. 73 Page 13
As Introduced
demonstrate conclusively that at the time the two-year period 339
expired, the member was physically or mentally incapacitated for 340
duty and unable to make an application. Application may not be 341
made by or for any person receiving age and service retirement 342
benefits under section 145.33, 145.331, 145.332, 145.335, or 343
145.37 or former section 145.34 of the Revised Code or any 344
person who, pursuant to section 145.40 of the Revised Code, has 345
been paid the accumulated contributions standing to the credit 346
of the person's individual account in the employees' savings 347
fund. The application shall be made on a form provided by the 348
retirement board. 349
(D) The benefit payable to any member who is approved for 350
a disability benefit shall become effective on the first day of 351
the month immediately following the later of the following: 352
(1) The last day for which compensation was paid; 353
(2) The attainment of eligibility for a disability 354
benefit. 355
(E) Medical examination of a member who has applied for a 356
disability benefit shall be conducted by a competent 357
disinterested examining physician to determine whether the 358
member is mentally or physically incapacitated for the 359
performance of duty by a disabling condition either permanent or 360
presumed to be permanent. The disability must have occurred 361
since last becoming a member or have increased since last 362
becoming a member to such extent as to make the disability 363
permanent or presumed to be permanent. A disability is presumed 364
to be permanent if it is expected to last for a continuous 365
period of not less than twelve months following the filing of 366
the application. 367

H. B. No. 73 Page 14
As Introduced
The standard used to determine whether a member is 368
incapacitated for duty is that the member is mentally or 369
physically incapable of performing the duties of the most recent 370
public position held by the member. 371
A Except as provided in section 145.76 of the Revised 372
Code, a member shall receive a disability benefit under section 373
145.36 or 145.361 of the Revised Code if all of the following 374
apply: 375
(1) The board's examining physician determines that the 376
member qualifies for a disability benefit and the board's 377
medical consultant concurs with the determination; 378
(2) The board concurs with the medical consultant's 379
determination; 380
(3) The member agrees to medical treatment as specified in 381
division (F) of this section. 382
A disability benefit described in this division may be 383
commenced prior to the board's concurrence with the 384
determination if the conditions specified in divisions (E)(1) 385
and (3) of this section are met. 386
The action of the board shall be final. 387
(F) The public employees retirement board shall adopt 388
rules requiring a disability benefit recipient, as a condition 389
of continuing to receive a disability benefit, to agree in 390
writing to obtain any medical treatment recommended by the 391
board's medical consultant and submit medical reports regarding 392
the treatment. If the board determines that a disability benefit 393
recipient is not obtaining the medical treatment or the board 394
does not receive a required medical report, the disability 395
benefit shall be suspended until the treatment is obtained, the 396

H. B. No. 73 Page 15
As Introduced
report is received by the board, or the board's medical 397
consultant certifies that the treatment is no longer helpful or 398
advisable. Should the recipient's failure to obtain treatment or 399
submit a medical report continue for one year, the recipient's 400
right to the disability benefit shall be terminated as of the 401
effective date of the original suspension. 402
The board shall require the recipient of a disability 403
benefit who is described in section 145.363 of the Revised Code 404
to comply with that section. 405
(G) A disability benefit that has been granted a member 406
but has not commenced shall not be paid if the member continues 407
in or returns to employment with the same employer in the same 408
position or in a position with duties similar to those of the 409
position the member held at the time the benefit was granted. 410
(H) In the event an employer files an application for a 411
disability benefit as a result of a member having been separated 412
from service because the member is considered to be mentally or 413
physically incapacitated for the performance of the member's 414
present duty, and the board's medical consultant reports to the 415
board that the member is physically and mentally capable of 416
performing service similar to that from which the member was 417
separated and the board concurs in the report, the board shall 418
so certify to the employer and the employer shall restore the 419
member to the member's previous position and salary or to a 420
similar position and salary. 421
Sec. 145.46. (A) A retirement allowance calculated under 422
section 145.33, 145.331, 145.332, or 145.335 of the Revised Code 423

by the public employees retirement board. A plan of payment 432
elected under this section shall be effective only if approved 433
by the board, which shall approve it only if it is certified by 434
an actuary engaged by the board to be the actuarial equivalent 435
of the retirement allowance calculated under section 145.33, 436
145.331, 145.332, or 145.335 of the Revised Code. 437
(B) The following plans of payment shall be offered by the 438
public employees retirement system: 439
(1) "Joint-life plan," an allowance that consists of the 440
actuarial equivalent of the member's retirement allowance 441
determined under section 145.33, 145.331, 145.332, or 145.335 of 442
the Revised Code in a lesser amount payable for life and one- 443
half or some other portion equal to ten per cent or more of the 444
allowance continuing after death to the member's designated 445
beneficiary for the beneficiary's life. The beneficiary shall be 446
nominated by written designation filed with the retirement 447
