well-informed public body reasonably would believe that the 496
public body was not violating or threatening to violate this 497

Section 41:
section; 498
(ii) That a well-informed public body reasonably would 499
believe that the conduct or threatened conduct that was the 500
basis of the injunction would serve the public policy that 501
underlies the authority that is asserted as permitting that 502
conduct or threatened conduct. 503
(b) If the court of common pleas does not issue an 504
injunction pursuant to division (I)(1) of this section and the 505
court determines at that time that the bringing of the action 506
was frivolous conduct, as defined in division (A) of section 507

counties shall investigate organized criminal activity within 551
the county or counties in accordance with the scope and limits 552
established by the organized crime investigations commission and 553
the task force director. For purposes of the investigation, the 554
task force director and investigatory staff shall have the 555
powers of a peace officer throughout the county or counties in 556
which the investigation is to be undertaken. However, the 557
authority and powers granted to the director and investigatory 558
staff under this section do not supplant or diminish the 559
authority and power provided by the Revised Code to other law 560
enforcement agencies or their officers or investigators. 561
An organized crime task force, in the conduct of its 562
investigation, may issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum. 563
The task force may compel the attendance of witnesses and the 564
production of records and papers of all kinds and description 565
that are relevant to the investigation, including, but not 566
limited to, any books, accounts, documents, and memoranda 567

the task force may apply to the court of common pleas of the 570
proper county for a contempt order, as in the case of 571
disobedience of the requirements of a subpoena issued from the 572
court of common pleas, or a refusal to testify thereon. 573
(B) This section and section 177.02 of the Revised Code do 574
not prevent an organized crime task force from cooperating with 575
other law enforcement agencies of this state, a political 576

(C)(1) If an organized crime task force, either prior to 581
the commencement of or during the course of its investigation of 582
organized criminal activity in a single county or in two or more 583
counties, has reason to believe that the investigation will 584
require it to engage in substantial investigative activities in 585
a particular municipal corporation or township in the county or 586
any of the counties, the task force director shall notify the 587
commission chairperson of that belief and the reasons for that 588
belief. The chairperson shall present that belief and those 589
reasons to the commission, and, if the commission determines 590
that there is a compelling reason to notify a local law 591
enforcement agency that has jurisdiction within that municipal 592
corporation or township that the task force will be engaging in 593
investigative activities in the municipal corporation or 594
township, the commission, subject to division (C)(2) of this 595

Section 44:
section, shall provide written notice of that fact as follows: 596
(a) If the investigative activities will be engaged in in 597
a township or in a municipal corporation that does not have a 598
police department or similar law enforcement agency, the 599
commission shall provide the notice to the sheriff of the county 600
in which the township or municipal corporation is located. 601
(b) If the investigative activities will be engaged in in 602
a municipal corporation that has a police department or similar 603
law enforcement agency, the commission shall provide the notice 604
to the chief law enforcement officer of the department or 605
agency. 606
(2) The notice described in division (C)(1) of this 607

Section 45:
section shall not be provided to a sheriff or chief law 608
enforcement officer if it appears to the commission, based upon 609
the complaint filed and any information relative to it or based 610
H. B. No. 527 Page 22

upon any information that the commission may have received, that 611
there is reason to believe that the office of that sheriff or 612
chief law enforcement officer is implicated in the organized 613
criminal activity being investigated. 614
(D)(1) If an organized crime task force determines, 615
pursuant to its investigation of organized criminal activity in 616
a single county or in two or more counties, that there is not 617
reasonable cause to believe that organized criminal activity has 618
occurred or is occurring in the county or in any of the 619
counties, it shall report its determination to the commission, 620
terminate its task force activities, and disband. 621
(2)(a) If a task force determines, pursuant to its 622
investigation of organized criminal activity in a single county 623
or in two or more counties, that there is reasonable cause to 624
believe that organized criminal activity has occurred or is 625
occurring in the county or in any of the counties, it shall 626
report its determination to the commission and, except as 627
provided in division (D)(3) of this section, shall refer a copy 628
of all of the information gathered during the course of the 629
investigation to the prosecuting attorney who has jurisdiction 630
over the matter and inform the prosecuting attorney that the 631
prosecuting attorney has thirty days to decide whether the 632
prosecuting attorney should present the information to a secret 633
grand jury and that, if the prosecuting attorney intends to make 634
a presentation of the information to the secret grand jury, the 635
prosecuting attorney has to give the commission written notice 636
of that intention. If the organized criminal activity occurred 637
or is occurring in two or more counties, the referral of the 638
information shall be to the prosecuting attorney of the county 639
in which the most significant portion of the activity occurred 640
or is occurring or, if it is not possible to determine that 641

prosecuting attorney will present the information to the secret 646
grand jury of the prosecuting attorney's county, the task force, 647
except as provided in division (D)(2)(b) of this section, shall 648
refer a copy of all of the information to the attorney general, 649
who shall proceed according to division (B) of section 109.83 of 650
the Revised Code. If the prosecuting attorney fails to notify 651
the commission in writing within that time that the prosecuting 652
attorney will present the information to the secret grand jury, 653
the prosecuting attorney promptly shall return all of the 654
information that the task force referred to the prosecuting 655
attorney under this division. 656
If a prosecuting attorney who has been referred 657
information under this division notifies the commission in 658
writing, within thirty days after the referral, of the 659
prosecuting attorney's intention to present the information 660
referred to the prosecuting attorney to the secret grand jury of 661
the prosecuting attorney's county, the prosecuting attorney 662
shall proceed promptly to present the information as evidence to 663
the secret grand jury and shall notify the commission of the 664
secret grand jury's final actions, findings of indictments, or 665
reports. The prosecuting attorney may disclose to the attorney 666
general any matters occurring before the secret grand jury that 667
are disclosed to the prosecuting attorney for use in the 668
performance of the prosecuting attorney's duties. The 669
prosecuting attorney shall present the information as evidence 670
to the secret grand jury prior to the discharge of the next 671
regular secret grand jury. If the prosecuting attorney fails to 672

section, shall notify the attorney general, the task force shall 675
refer a copy of all of the information to the attorney general, 676
and the attorney general may proceed as if the prosecuting 677
attorney had declined under this division to accept the matter. 678
If the prosecuting attorney fails to present the information as 679
evidence within that time, the prosecuting attorney promptly 680
shall return to the task force all of the information that the 681
task force had referred to the prosecuting attorney under this 682
division. 683
(b) If a prosecuting attorney who has been referred 684
information under division (D)(2)(a) of this section fails to 685
notify the commission in accordance with that division that the 686
prosecuting attorney will present the information to the secret 687
grand jury, and the task force that conducted the investigation 688
determines, pursuant to its investigation, that the office of 689
the attorney general is implicated in organized criminal 690
activity, the task force shall not contact or refer any 691
information to the attorney general but shall report its 692
determinations and refer all of the information to the 693
commission. If a prosecuting attorney who has been referred 694
information under division (D)(2)(a) of this section notifies 695
the commission in accordance with that division that the 696
prosecuting attorney intends to present the information to the 697
secret grand jury but fails to do so prior to the discharge of 698
the next regular secret grand jury, and the task force that 699
conducted the investigation determines, pursuant to the 700
investigation, that the office of the attorney general is 701
implicated in organized criminal activity, neither the 702
commission nor the task force shall contact or refer any 703

commission. 707
In either such case, the commission shall review the 708
information, and, if a majority of the members of the commission 709
determine that the office of the attorney general is implicated, 710
the chairperson of the commission shall appear before the 711
presiding judge of the court of common pleas or of the court of 712
appeals for the county in which the prosecuting attorney who was 713
referred the information serves and request the appointment of a 714

finds that there is reasonable cause to believe that organized 716
criminal activity has occurred or is occurring in the county or 717
in any of the counties served by the task force and that the 718
office of the attorney general is implicated, the judge shall 719
appoint a special prosecutor to perform the functions of 720
prosecuting attorney of the county in relation to the matter. 721
The commission shall refer a copy of all of the information 722
gathered during the course of the investigation to the special 723
prosecutor. The special prosecutor shall review the information 724
so referred and, upon a determination that there is cause to 725
prosecute for the commission of a crime, the special prosecutor 726
shall proceed promptly to present the information so referred to 727
the secret grand jury and shall notify the commission of the 728
secret grand jury's final actions, findings of indictments, or 729
reports. A special prosecutor appointed under this division 730

office of a prosecuting attorney who normally would be referred 739
the information gathered during the course of the investigation 740
pursuant to division (D)(2) of this section is implicated by the 741

not contact or refer any information to the prosecuting 743
attorney. Instead it shall report its determinations and refer 744
all of the information gathered during the course of the 745
investigation to the commission. The commission shall review the 746
information, and if a majority of the members of the commission 747
determine that the office of the prosecuting attorney is 748

the commission shall appear before the presiding judge of the 750
court of common pleas or of the court of appeals for the county 751
in which that prosecuting attorney serves and request the 752

presiding judge finds that there is reasonable cause to believe 754
that organized criminal activity has occurred or is occurring in 755
the county or in any of the counties served by the task force 756
and that the office of the prosecuting attorney in question is 757
implicated in organized criminal activity, the judge shall 758
appoint a special prosecutor to perform the functions of 759
prosecuting attorney of the county in relation to the matter, 760
and the commission shall refer a copy of all of the information 761
gathered during the course of the investigation to the special 762
prosecutor. It shall inform the special prosecutor that the 763
special prosecutor has thirty days to decide whether the special 764

youthful dispositional sentence on a child when required under 1039
division (B)(3) of section 2152.121 of the Revised Code. In such 1040
a case, the remaining provisions of this division and divisions 1041
(B) and (C) do not apply to the child, and the court shall 1042
impose the mandatory serious youthful dispositional sentence 1043
under division (D)(1) of this section. 1044
In all other cases, a juvenile court may impose a serious 1045
youthful offender dispositional sentence on a child only if the 1046
prosecuting attorney of the county in which the delinquent act 1047
allegedly occurred initiates the process against the child in 1048
accordance with this division, and the child is an alleged 1049
delinquent child who is eligible for the dispositional sentence. 1050
The prosecuting attorney may initiate the process in any of the 1051
following ways: 1052
(1) Obtaining an indictment of the child as a serious 1053
youthful offender; 1054
(2) The child waives the right to indictment, charging the 1055
child in a bill of information as a serious youthful offender; 1056
(3) Until an indictment or information is obtained, 1057
requesting a serious youthful offender dispositional sentence in 1058
the original complaint alleging that the child is a delinquent 1059
child; 1060
(4) Until an indictment or information is obtained, if the 1061
original complaint does not request a serious youthful offender 1062
dispositional sentence, filing with the juvenile court a written 1063
notice of intent to seek a serious youthful offender 1064
dispositional sentence within twenty days after the later of the 1065
following, unless the time is extended by the juvenile court for 1066

regarding the complaint; 1069
(b) The date the juvenile court determines not to transfer 1070
the case under section 2152.12 of the Revised Code. 1071
After a written notice is filed under division (A)(4) of 1072
this section, the juvenile court shall serve a copy of the 1073
notice on the child and advise the child of the prosecuting 1074
attorney's intent to seek a serious youthful offender 1075
dispositional sentence in the case. 1076
(B) If an alleged delinquent child is not indicted or 1077
charged by information as described in division (A)(1) or (2) of 1078
this section and if a notice or complaint as described in 1079
division (A)(3) or (4) of this section indicates that the 1080
prosecuting attorney intends to pursue a serious youthful 1081
offender dispositional sentence in the case, the juvenile court 1082
shall hold a preliminary hearing to determine if there is 1083
probable cause that the child committed the act charged and is 1084
by age eligible for, or required to receive, a serious youthful 1085
offender dispositional sentence. 1086
(C)(1) A child for whom a serious youthful offender 1087
dispositional sentence is sought by a prosecuting attorney has 1088
the right to a secret grand jury determination of probable cause 1089
that the child committed the act charged and that the child is 1090
eligible by age for a serious youthful offender dispositional 1091
sentence. The secret grand jury may be impaneled by the court of 1092
common pleas or the juvenile court. 1093
Once a child is indicted, or charged by information or the 1094
juvenile court determines that the child is eligible for a 1095

entitled to an open and speedy trial by jury in juvenile court 1097

time within which the trial is to be held under Title XXIX of 1099
the Revised Code commences on whichever of the following dates 1100
is applicable: 1101

the date of the filing of the indictment or information. 1103

requests a serious youthful offender dispositional sentence, on 1105
the date of the filing of the complaint. 1106
(c) If the child is not charged by an original complaint 1107
that requests a serious youthful offender dispositional 1108
sentence, on the date that the prosecuting attorney files the 1109
written notice of intent to seek a serious youthful offender 1110
dispositional sentence. 1111
(2) If the child is detained awaiting adjudication, upon 1112
indictment or being charged by information, the child has the 1113
same right to bail as an adult charged with the offense the 1114
alleged delinquent act would be if committed by an adult. Except 1115
as provided in division (D) of section 2152.14 of the Revised 1116
Code, all provisions of Title XXIX of the Revised Code and the 1117
Criminal Rules shall apply in the case and to the child. The 1118
juvenile court shall afford the child all rights afforded a 1119
person who is prosecuted for committing a crime including the 1120
right to counsel and the right to raise the issue of competency. 1121
The child may not waive the right to counsel. 1122

successful completion of the traditional juvenile dispositions 1139
imposed. 1140

committing an act under circumstances that allow, but do not 1142
require, the juvenile court to impose on the child a serious 1143
youthful offender dispositional sentence under section 2152.11 1144
of the Revised Code, all of the following apply: 1145
(i) If the juvenile court on the record makes a finding 1146
that, given the nature and circumstances of the violation and 1147
the history of the child, the length of time, level of security, 1148
and types of programming and resources available in the juvenile 1149
system alone are not adequate to provide the juvenile court with 1150
a reasonable expectation that the purposes set forth in section 1151

Section 52:
2152.01 of the Revised Code will be met, the juvenile court may 1152
impose upon the child a sentence available for the violation, as 1153

discipline, promotion, demotion, or compensation of a public 377

public body purporting to convey, lease, or otherwise dispose of 411
any right, title, or interest in any public property shall be 412

this section insofar as title or other interest of any bona fide 414

(H) A resolution, rule, or formal action of any kind is 464
invalid unless adopted in an open meeting of the public body. A 465
resolution, rule, or formal action adopted in an open meeting 466
that results from deliberations in a meeting not open to the 467
public is invalid unless the deliberations were for a purpose 468
specifically authorized in division (G) or (J) of this section 469
and conducted at an executive session held in compliance with 470
this section. A resolution, rule, or formal action adopted in an 471

As Introduced
(i) That, based on the ordinary application of statutory 493
law and case law as it existed at the time of violation or 494
threatened violation that was the basis of the injunction, a 495
well-informed public body reasonably would believe that the 496
public body was not violating or threatening to violate this 497
section; 498
(ii) That a well-informed public body reasonably would 499
believe that the conduct or threatened conduct that was the 500
basis of the injunction would serve the public policy that 501
underlies the authority that is asserted as permitting that 502
conduct or threatened conduct. 503
(b) If the court of common pleas does not issue an 504
injunction pursuant to division (I)(1) of this section and the 505
court determines at that time that the bringing of the action 506
was frivolous conduct, as defined in division (A) of section 507
2323.51 of the Revised Code, the court shall award to the public 508
body all court costs and reasonable attorney's fees, as 509
determined by the court. 510

assistance under sections 5901.01 to 5901.15 of the Revised 534
Code, and shall not exclude representatives selected by the 535
applicant, recipient, or former recipient, from a meeting that 536
the commission conducts as an executive session that pertains to 537
the applicant's, recipient's, or former recipient's application 538
for financial assistance. 539
(3) A veterans service commission shall vote on the grant 540
or denial of financial assistance under sections 5901.01 to 541
5901.15 of the Revised Code only in an open meeting of the 542
commission. The minutes of the meeting shall indicate the name, 543

H. B. No. 527 Page 20
As Introduced
counties shall investigate organized criminal activity within 551
the county or counties in accordance with the scope and limits 552
established by the organized crime investigations commission and 553
the task force director. For purposes of the investigation, the 554
task force director and investigatory staff shall have the 555
powers of a peace officer throughout the county or counties in 556
which the investigation is to be undertaken. However, the 557
authority and powers granted to the director and investigatory 558
staff under this section do not supplant or diminish the 559
authority and power provided by the Revised Code to other law 560
enforcement agencies or their officers or investigators. 561
An organized crime task force, in the conduct of its 562
investigation, may issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum. 563
The task force may compel the attendance of witnesses and the 564
production of records and papers of all kinds and description 565
that are relevant to the investigation, including, but not 566
limited to, any books, accounts, documents, and memoranda 567
pertaining to the subject of the investigation. Upon the failure 568
of any person to comply with any lawful order of the task force, 569
the task force may apply to the court of common pleas of the 570
proper county for a contempt order, as in the case of 571
disobedience of the requirements of a subpoena issued from the 572
court of common pleas, or a refusal to testify thereon. 573
(B) This section and section 177.02 of the Revised Code do 574
not prevent an organized crime task force from cooperating with 575
other law enforcement agencies of this state, a political 576
subdivision of this state, another state, a political 577
subdivision of another state, or the United States, or their 578
officers or investigators in the investigation and prosecution 579
of any offenses comprising organized criminal activity. 580

As Introduced
(C)(1) If an organized crime task force, either prior to 581
the commencement of or during the course of its investigation of 582
organized criminal activity in a single county or in two or more 583
counties, has reason to believe that the investigation will 584
require it to engage in substantial investigative activities in 585
a particular municipal corporation or township in the county or 586
any of the counties, the task force director shall notify the 587
commission chairperson of that belief and the reasons for that 588
belief. The chairperson shall present that belief and those 589
reasons to the commission, and, if the commission determines 590
that there is a compelling reason to notify a local law 591
enforcement agency that has jurisdiction within that municipal 592
corporation or township that the task force will be engaging in 593
investigative activities in the municipal corporation or 594
township, the commission, subject to division (C)(2) of this 595
section, shall provide written notice of that fact as follows: 596
(a) If the investigative activities will be engaged in in 597
a township or in a municipal corporation that does not have a 598
police department or similar law enforcement agency, the 599
commission shall provide the notice to the sheriff of the county 600
in which the township or municipal corporation is located. 601
(b) If the investigative activities will be engaged in in 602
a municipal corporation that has a police department or similar 603
law enforcement agency, the commission shall provide the notice 604
to the chief law enforcement officer of the department or 605
agency. 606
(2) The notice described in division (C)(1) of this 607
section shall not be provided to a sheriff or chief law 608
enforcement officer if it appears to the commission, based upon 609
the complaint filed and any information relative to it or based 610

H. B. No. 527 Page 22
As Introduced
upon any information that the commission may have received, that 611
there is reason to believe that the office of that sheriff or 612
chief law enforcement officer is implicated in the organized 613
criminal activity being investigated. 614
(D)(1) If an organized crime task force determines, 615
pursuant to its investigation of organized criminal activity in 616
a single county or in two or more counties, that there is not 617
reasonable cause to believe that organized criminal activity has 618
occurred or is occurring in the county or in any of the 619
counties, it shall report its determination to the commission, 620
terminate its task force activities, and disband. 621
(2)(a) If a task force determines, pursuant to its 622
investigation of organized criminal activity in a single county 623
or in two or more counties, that there is reasonable cause to 624
believe that organized criminal activity has occurred or is 625
occurring in the county or in any of the counties, it shall 626
report its determination to the commission and, except as 627
provided in division (D)(3) of this section, shall refer a copy 628
of all of the information gathered during the course of the 629
investigation to the prosecuting attorney who has jurisdiction 630
over the matter and inform the prosecuting attorney that the 631
prosecuting attorney has thirty days to decide whether the 632
prosecuting attorney should present the information to a secret 633
grand jury and that, if the prosecuting attorney intends to make 634
a presentation of the information to the secret grand jury, the 635
prosecuting attorney has to give the commission written notice 636
of that intention. If the organized criminal activity occurred 637
or is occurring in two or more counties, the referral of the 638
information shall be to the prosecuting attorney of the county 639
in which the most significant portion of the activity occurred 640
or is occurring or, if it is not possible to determine that 641

If a prosecuting attorney who has been referred 643
information under this division fails to notify the commission 644
in writing, within thirty days after the referral, that the 645
prosecuting attorney will present the information to the secret 646
grand jury of the prosecuting attorney's county, the task force, 647
except as provided in division (D)(2)(b) of this section, shall 648
refer a copy of all of the information to the attorney general, 649
who shall proceed according to division (B) of section 109.83 of 650
the Revised Code. If the prosecuting attorney fails to notify 651
the commission in writing within that time that the prosecuting 652
attorney will present the information to the secret grand jury, 653
the prosecuting attorney promptly shall return all of the 654
information that the task force referred to the prosecuting 655
attorney under this division. 656
If a prosecuting attorney who has been referred 657
information under this division notifies the commission in 658
writing, within thirty days after the referral, of the 659
prosecuting attorney's intention to present the information 660
referred to the prosecuting attorney to the secret grand jury of 661
the prosecuting attorney's county, the prosecuting attorney 662
shall proceed promptly to present the information as evidence to 663
the secret grand jury and shall notify the commission of the 664
secret grand jury's final actions, findings of indictments, or 665
reports. The prosecuting attorney may disclose to the attorney 666
general any matters occurring before the secret grand jury that 667
are disclosed to the prosecuting attorney for use in the 668
performance of the prosecuting attorney's duties. The 669
prosecuting attorney shall present the information as evidence 670
to the secret grand jury prior to the discharge of the next 671
regular secret grand jury. If the prosecuting attorney fails to 672

commission, except as provided in division (D)(2)(b) of this 674
section, shall notify the attorney general, the task force shall 675
refer a copy of all of the information to the attorney general, 676
and the attorney general may proceed as if the prosecuting 677
attorney had declined under this division to accept the matter. 678
If the prosecuting attorney fails to present the information as 679
evidence within that time, the prosecuting attorney promptly 680
shall return to the task force all of the information that the 681
task force had referred to the prosecuting attorney under this 682
division. 683
(b) If a prosecuting attorney who has been referred 684
information under division (D)(2)(a) of this section fails to 685
notify the commission in accordance with that division that the 686
prosecuting attorney will present the information to the secret 687
grand jury, and the task force that conducted the investigation 688
determines, pursuant to its investigation, that the office of 689
the attorney general is implicated in organized criminal 690
activity, the task force shall not contact or refer any 691
information to the attorney general but shall report its 692
determinations and refer all of the information to the 693
commission. If a prosecuting attorney who has been referred 694
information under division (D)(2)(a) of this section notifies 695
the commission in accordance with that division that the 696
prosecuting attorney intends to present the information to the 697
secret grand jury but fails to do so prior to the discharge of 698
the next regular secret grand jury, and the task force that 699
conducted the investigation determines, pursuant to the 700
investigation, that the office of the attorney general is 701
implicated in organized criminal activity, neither the 702
commission nor the task force shall contact or refer any 703

information to the attorney general. Instead, the task force 704
shall report its determinations and refer all of the information 705
gathered during the course of the investigation to the 706
commission. 707
In either such case, the commission shall review the 708
information, and, if a majority of the members of the commission 709
determine that the office of the attorney general is implicated, 710
the chairperson of the commission shall appear before the 711
presiding judge of the court of common pleas or of the court of 712
appeals for the county in which the prosecuting attorney who was 713
referred the information serves and request the appointment of a 714
special prosecutor to handle the matter. If the presiding judge 715
finds that there is reasonable cause to believe that organized 716
criminal activity has occurred or is occurring in the county or 717
in any of the counties served by the task force and that the 718
office of the attorney general is implicated, the judge shall 719
appoint a special prosecutor to perform the functions of 720
prosecuting attorney of the county in relation to the matter. 721
The commission shall refer a copy of all of the information 722
gathered during the course of the investigation to the special 723
prosecutor. The special prosecutor shall review the information 724
so referred and, upon a determination that there is cause to 725
prosecute for the commission of a crime, the special prosecutor 726
shall proceed promptly to present the information so referred to 727
the secret grand jury and shall notify the commission of the 728
secret grand jury's final actions, findings of indictments, or 729
reports. A special prosecutor appointed under this division 730
shall not inform the attorney general of the investigation or 731
referral of information and shall not cooperate with the 732
attorney general on the matter. 733

investigation of organized criminal activity in a single county 735
or in two or more counties, that there is reasonable cause to 736

office of a prosecuting attorney who normally would be referred 739
the information gathered during the course of the investigation 740
pursuant to division (D)(2) of this section is implicated by the 741
information in organized criminal activity, the task force shall 742
not contact or refer any information to the prosecuting 743
attorney. Instead it shall report its determinations and refer 744
all of the information gathered during the course of the 745
investigation to the commission. The commission shall review the 746
information, and if a majority of the members of the commission 747
determine that the office of the prosecuting attorney is 748
implicated in organized criminal activity, the chairperson of 749
the commission shall appear before the presiding judge of the 750
court of common pleas or of the court of appeals for the county 751
in which that prosecuting attorney serves and request the 752
appointment of a special prosecutor to handle the matter. If the 753
presiding judge finds that there is reasonable cause to believe 754
that organized criminal activity has occurred or is occurring in 755
the county or in any of the counties served by the task force 756
and that the office of the prosecuting attorney in question is 757
implicated in organized criminal activity, the judge shall 758
appoint a special prosecutor to perform the functions of 759
prosecuting attorney of the county in relation to the matter, 760
and the commission shall refer a copy of all of the information 761
gathered during the course of the investigation to the special 762
prosecutor. It shall inform the special prosecutor that the 763
special prosecutor has thirty days to decide whether the special 764
prosecutor should present the information to a secret grand jury 765
and that if the special prosecutor intends to make a 766

to this division to appoint a special prosecutor but the judge 778
does not do so, the commission shall refer a copy of all of the 779
information to the attorney general, who shall proceed according 780
to division (B) of section 109.83 of the Revised Code. Upon such 781
a failure of a special prosecutor to notify the commission, the 782
special prosecutor promptly shall return to the commission all 783
of the information that the commission had referred to the 784
special prosecutor under this division. 785
If a special prosecutor who has been referred information 786
under this division notifies the commission in writing, within 787
thirty days after the referral, of the special prosecutor's 788

commission of the secret grand jury's final actions, findings of 793
indictments, or reports. The special prosecutor may disclose to 794
the attorney general any matters occurring before the secret 795

as evidence within that time, the commission shall notify the 801
attorney general and refer a copy of all of the information to 802
the attorney general, the attorney general may proceed as if the 803
special prosecutor had declined under this division to accept 804

youthful dispositional sentence on a child when required under 1039
division (B)(3) of section 2152.121 of the Revised Code. In such 1040

(B) and (C) do not apply to the child, and the court shall 1042
impose the mandatory serious youthful dispositional sentence 1043
under division (D)(1) of this section. 1044
In all other cases, a juvenile court may impose a serious 1045
youthful offender dispositional sentence on a child only if the 1046
prosecuting attorney of the county in which the delinquent act 1047
allegedly occurred initiates the process against the child in 1048
accordance with this division, and the child is an alleged 1049
delinquent child who is eligible for the dispositional sentence. 1050
The prosecuting attorney may initiate the process in any of the 1051
following ways: 1052
(1) Obtaining an indictment of the child as a serious 1053
youthful offender; 1054
(2) The child waives the right to indictment, charging the 1055
child in a bill of information as a serious youthful offender; 1056
(3) Until an indictment or information is obtained, 1057
requesting a serious youthful offender dispositional sentence in 1058
the original complaint alleging that the child is a delinquent 1059
child; 1060
(4) Until an indictment or information is obtained, if the 1061
original complaint does not request a serious youthful offender 1062
dispositional sentence, filing with the juvenile court a written 1063
notice of intent to seek a serious youthful offender 1064
dispositional sentence within twenty days after the later of the 1065

regarding the complaint; 1069
(b) The date the juvenile court determines not to transfer 1070
the case under section 2152.12 of the Revised Code. 1071
After a written notice is filed under division (A)(4) of 1072
this section, the juvenile court shall serve a copy of the 1073
notice on the child and advise the child of the prosecuting 1074
attorney's intent to seek a serious youthful offender 1075
dispositional sentence in the case. 1076
(B) If an alleged delinquent child is not indicted or 1077
charged by information as described in division (A)(1) or (2) of 1078
this section and if a notice or complaint as described in 1079
division (A)(3) or (4) of this section indicates that the 1080
prosecuting attorney intends to pursue a serious youthful 1081
offender dispositional sentence in the case, the juvenile court 1082
shall hold a preliminary hearing to determine if there is 1083
probable cause that the child committed the act charged and is 1084
by age eligible for, or required to receive, a serious youthful 1085
offender dispositional sentence. 1086
(C)(1) A child for whom a serious youthful offender 1087
dispositional sentence is sought by a prosecuting attorney has 1088
the right to a secret grand jury determination of probable cause 1089
that the child committed the act charged and that the child is 1090
eligible by age for a serious youthful offender dispositional 1091
sentence. The secret grand jury may be impaneled by the court of 1092
common pleas or the juvenile court. 1093
Once a child is indicted, or charged by information or the 1094
juvenile court determines that the child is eligible for a 1095

requests a serious youthful offender dispositional sentence, on 1105
the date of the filing of the complaint. 1106
(c) If the child is not charged by an original complaint 1107
that requests a serious youthful offender dispositional 1108
sentence, on the date that the prosecuting attorney files the 1109
written notice of intent to seek a serious youthful offender 1110
dispositional sentence. 1111
(2) If the child is detained awaiting adjudication, upon 1112
indictment or being charged by information, the child has the 1113
same right to bail as an adult charged with the offense the 1114
alleged delinquent act would be if committed by an adult. Except 1115
as provided in division (D) of section 2152.14 of the Revised 1116
Code, all provisions of Title XXIX of the Revised Code and the 1117
Criminal Rules shall apply in the case and to the child. The 1118
juvenile court shall afford the child all rights afforded a 1119
person who is prosecuted for committing a crime including the 1120
right to counsel and the right to raise the issue of competency. 1121
The child may not waive the right to counsel. 1122

successful completion of the traditional juvenile dispositions 1139
imposed. 1140

committing an act under circumstances that allow, but do not 1142
require, the juvenile court to impose on the child a serious 1143
youthful offender dispositional sentence under section 2152.11 1144
of the Revised Code, all of the following apply: 1145
(i) If the juvenile court on the record makes a finding 1146
that, given the nature and circumstances of the violation and 1147
the history of the child, the length of time, level of security, 1148
and types of programming and resources available in the juvenile 1149
system alone are not adequate to provide the juvenile court with 1150
a reasonable expectation that the purposes set forth in section 1151
2152.01 of the Revised Code will be met, the juvenile court may 1152
impose upon the child a sentence available for the violation, as 1153
