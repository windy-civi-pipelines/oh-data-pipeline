criteria established by an engineering study, as defined by the 1784
director, that any speed limit set forth in divisions (B)(1)(a) 1785
to (D) of this section is greater or less than is reasonable or 1786
safe under the conditions found to exist at any portion of a 1787
street or highway under the jurisdiction of the director, the 1788
director shall determine and declare a reasonable and safe 1789
prima-facie speed limit, which shall be effective when 1790
appropriate signs giving notice of it are erected at the 1791
location. 1792
(2) Whenever the director determines upon the basis of 1793
criteria established by an engineering study, as defined by the 1794
director, that the speed limit of fifty-five miles per hour on a 1795
two-lane state route outside a municipal corporation is less 1796
than is reasonable or safe under the conditions found to exist 1797
at that portion of the state route, the director may determine 1798
and declare a speed limit of sixty miles per hour for that 1799
portion of the state route, which shall be effective when 1800
appropriate signs giving notice of it are erected at the 1801

interstate six hundred seventy, interstate two hundred seventy- 1808
five, and interstate ninety commencing at the intersection of 1809
that interstate with interstate seventy-one and continuing to 1810
the border of the state of Ohio with the state of Pennsylvania. 1811
The director shall establish criteria for determining the 1812
appropriate use of variable speed limits and shall establish 1813
variable speed limits in accordance with the criteria. The 1814
director may establish variable speed limits based upon the time 1815
of day, weather conditions, traffic incidents, or other factors 1816
that affect the safe speed on a street or highway. The director 1817
shall not establish a variable speed limit that is based on a 1818
particular type or class of vehicle. A variable speed limit 1819
established by the director under this section is effective when 1820
appropriate signs giving notice of the speed limit are displayed 1821
at the location. 1822
(b) Except for variable speed limits established under 1823
division (H)(3)(a) of this section, the director shall establish 1824
a variable speed limit under the authority granted to the 1825
director by this section on not more than two additional 1826
highways and only pursuant to criteria established in rules 1827
adopted in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code. The 1828
rules shall be based on the criteria described in division (H) 1829
(3)(a) of this section. The rules also shall establish the 1830
parameters of any engineering study necessary for determining 1831
when variable speed limits are appropriate. 1832
(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit 1833
the authority of the director to establish speed limits within a 1834
construction zone as authorized under section 4511.98 of the 1835
Revised Code. 1836

as defined by the director, that the speed permitted by 1840
divisions (B)(1)(a) to (D) of this section, on any part of a 1841
highway under their jurisdiction, is greater than is reasonable 1842
and safe under the conditions found to exist at such location, 1843
the local authorities may by resolution request the director to 1844
determine and declare a reasonable and safe prima-facie speed 1845
limit. Upon receipt of such request the director may determine 1846
and declare a reasonable and safe prima-facie speed limit at 1847
such location, and if the director does so, then such declared 1848
speed limit shall become effective only when appropriate signs 1849
giving notice thereof are erected at such location by the local 1850
authorities. The director may withdraw the declaration of a 1851
prima-facie speed limit whenever in the director's opinion the 1852
altered prima-facie speed limit becomes unreasonable. Upon such 1853
withdrawal, the declared prima-facie speed limit shall become 1854

removed by the local authorities. 1856
(2) A local authority may determine on the basis of 1857
criteria established by an engineering study, as defined by the 1858
director, that the speed limit of sixty-five or seventy miles 1859
per hour on a portion of a freeway under its jurisdiction is 1860
greater than is reasonable or safe under the conditions found to 1861
exist at that portion of the freeway. If the local authority 1862
makes such a determination, the local authority by resolution 1863
may request the director to determine and declare a reasonable 1864
and safe speed limit of not less than fifty-five miles per hour 1865
for that portion of the freeway. If the director takes such 1866
action, the declared speed limit becomes effective only when 1867

location by the local authority. 1869
(J) Local authorities in their respective jurisdictions 1870
may authorize by ordinance higher prima-facie speeds than those 1871
stated in this section upon through highways, or upon highways 1872
or portions thereof where there are no intersections, or between 1873
widely spaced intersections, provided signs are erected giving 1874
notice of the authorized speed, but local authorities shall not 1875
modify or alter the basic rule set forth in division (A) of this 1876

Section 88:
section or in any event authorize by ordinance a speed in excess 1877
of the maximum speed permitted by division (D) of this section 1878
for the specified type of highway. 1879
Alteration of prima-facie limits on state routes by local 1880
authorities shall not be effective until the alteration has been 1881
approved by the director. The director may withdraw approval of 1882
any altered prima-facie speed limits whenever in the director's 1883
opinion any altered prima-facie speed becomes unreasonable, and 1884
upon such withdrawal, the altered prima-facie speed shall become 1885

unimproved highway under its jurisdiction and in the 1899
unincorporated territory of the township is greater than is 1900
reasonable or safe under the conditions found to exist at the 1901
location, the board may by resolution declare a reasonable and 1902
safe prima-facie speed limit of fifty-five but not less than 1903
twenty-five miles per hour. An altered speed limit adopted by a 1904
board of township trustees under this division becomes effective 1905
when appropriate traffic control devices, as prescribed in 1906

(3)(a) Whenever, in the opinion of a board of township 1910
trustees, any altered prima-facie speed limit established by the 1911
board under this division becomes unreasonable, the board may 1912
adopt a resolution withdrawing the altered prima-facie speed 1913
limit. Upon the adoption of such a resolution, the altered 1914
prima-facie speed limit becomes ineffective and the traffic 1915
control devices relating thereto shall be immediately removed. 1916
(b) Whenever a highway ceases to be an unimproved highway 1917
and the board has adopted an altered prima-facie speed limit 1918
pursuant to division (K)(2) of this section, the board shall, by 1919
resolution, withdraw the altered prima-facie speed limit as soon 1920
as the highway ceases to be unimproved. Upon the adoption of 1921
such a resolution, the altered prima-facie speed limit becomes 1922

has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one prior violation 1371
of this section or a substantially equivalent municipal 1372

not more than two hundred fifty dollars. 1374
(c) If, within two years of the violation, the offender 1375
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more prior 1376

the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, 1388
shall impose upon the offender a fine of two times the amount 1389

driver's license if the offender submits the written evidence to 1403
the court within 90 days of the violation of division (A) of 1404
this section. However, successful completion of the course does 1405
not result in a dismissal of the charges for the violation, and 1406
the violation is a prior offense under divisions (D)(1)(b) and 1407
(c) of this section if the offender commits a subsequent 1408
violation or violations of division (A) of this section within 1409
two years of the offense for which the course was completed. 1410
This division does not apply with respect to any offender in the 1411

if the offender commits a violation of this section in an active 1423
school zone, the court, in addition to all other penalties 1424
provided by law, shall impose a fine of two times the usual 1425
amount imposed for the violation. 1426
(6) The offense established under this section is a strict 1427
liability offense and section 2901.20 of the Revised Code does 1428
not apply. The designation of this offense as a strict liability 1429
offense shall not be construed to imply that any other offense, 1430

ordinance that are greater than the penalties prescribed in this 1436
section for violations of this section. 1437

section does not preclude a prosecution for an offense in 1439
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance 1440
based on the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied 1441
offenses of similar import under section 2941.25 of the Revised 1442

criteria established by an engineering study, as defined by the 1784
director, that any speed limit set forth in divisions (B)(1)(a) 1785
to (D) of this section is greater or less than is reasonable or 1786
safe under the conditions found to exist at any portion of a 1787
street or highway under the jurisdiction of the director, the 1788
director shall determine and declare a reasonable and safe 1789
prima-facie speed limit, which shall be effective when 1790
appropriate signs giving notice of it are erected at the 1791
location. 1792
(2) Whenever the director determines upon the basis of 1793
criteria established by an engineering study, as defined by the 1794
director, that the speed limit of fifty-five miles per hour on a 1795
two-lane state route outside a municipal corporation is less 1796
than is reasonable or safe under the conditions found to exist 1797
at that portion of the state route, the director may determine 1798

interstate six hundred seventy, interstate two hundred seventy- 1808
five, and interstate ninety commencing at the intersection of 1809
that interstate with interstate seventy-one and continuing to 1810
the border of the state of Ohio with the state of Pennsylvania. 1811
The director shall establish criteria for determining the 1812
appropriate use of variable speed limits and shall establish 1813
variable speed limits in accordance with the criteria. The 1814
director may establish variable speed limits based upon the time 1815
of day, weather conditions, traffic incidents, or other factors 1816
that affect the safe speed on a street or highway. The director 1817
shall not establish a variable speed limit that is based on a 1818
particular type or class of vehicle. A variable speed limit 1819

(b) Except for variable speed limits established under 1823
division (H)(3)(a) of this section, the director shall establish 1824
a variable speed limit under the authority granted to the 1825
director by this section on not more than two additional 1826
highways and only pursuant to criteria established in rules 1827
adopted in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code. The 1828
rules shall be based on the criteria described in division (H) 1829
(3)(a) of this section. The rules also shall establish the 1830
parameters of any engineering study necessary for determining 1831
when variable speed limits are appropriate. 1832
(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit 1833
the authority of the director to establish speed limits within a 1834

as defined by the director, that the speed permitted by 1840
divisions (B)(1)(a) to (D) of this section, on any part of a 1841
highway under their jurisdiction, is greater than is reasonable 1842
and safe under the conditions found to exist at such location, 1843
the local authorities may by resolution request the director to 1844
determine and declare a reasonable and safe prima-facie speed 1845
limit. Upon receipt of such request the director may determine 1846

such location, and if the director does so, then such declared 1848
speed limit shall become effective only when appropriate signs 1849
giving notice thereof are erected at such location by the local 1850
authorities. The director may withdraw the declaration of a 1851
prima-facie speed limit whenever in the director's opinion the 1852
altered prima-facie speed limit becomes unreasonable. Upon such 1853
withdrawal, the declared prima-facie speed limit shall become 1854

criteria established by an engineering study, as defined by the 1858
director, that the speed limit of sixty-five or seventy miles 1859
per hour on a portion of a freeway under its jurisdiction is 1860
greater than is reasonable or safe under the conditions found to 1861
exist at that portion of the freeway. If the local authority 1862
makes such a determination, the local authority by resolution 1863
may request the director to determine and declare a reasonable 1864

section or in any event authorize by ordinance a speed in excess 1877
of the maximum speed permitted by division (D) of this section 1878
for the specified type of highway. 1879
Alteration of prima-facie limits on state routes by local 1880
authorities shall not be effective until the alteration has been 1881
approved by the director. The director may withdraw approval of 1882
any altered prima-facie speed limits whenever in the director's 1883
opinion any altered prima-facie speed becomes unreasonable, and 1884
upon such withdrawal, the altered prima-facie speed shall become 1885
