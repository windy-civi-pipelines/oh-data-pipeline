it is truly deserving of high praise; and 13

Library has fostered education, culture, and individual growth by 15

example of excellence that is worthy of emulation; and 20
WHEREAS, Public libraries play an important role in today’s 21
society, serving as receptacles of shared knowledge, information, and 22
ideas. They offer a means of enjoyment, self-advancement, and 23
intellectual development for all individuals, and as repositories for 24
the best of our nation’s intellectual endeavors, they are vital to the 25
preservation of our country’s heritage, principles, and ideals. We are 26
