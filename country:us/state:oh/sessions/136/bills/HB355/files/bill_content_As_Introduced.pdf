governor at the most recent general election for that office, 710
submit a petition to the board requesting that the election 711

the same form of government and the same elected board of 784
trustees as its governing body. The township shall continue to 785
receive all of its tax levies and sources of income as a 786

the district. The income tax shall follow the provisions of 1064
Chapter 718. of the Revised Code, except that a vote shall be 1065
required by the electors residing in the district to approve the 1066
rate of income tax. If no electors reside within the district, 1067
then division (F)(4) of this section applies. The rate of the 1068
income tax shall be no higher than the highest rate being levied 1069
by a municipal corporation that is a party to the contract. 1070
(1) Within one hundred eighty days after the first meeting 1071

district. Any increase in the rate of an income tax that was 1081
first levied within one hundred eighty days after the first 1082
meeting of the board of directors shall be approved by a vote of 1083
the electors of the district, shall be in force for the 1084
remaining period of the contract establishing the district, and 1085
shall not be subject to division (F)(2) of this section. 1086
(2) Any resolution of the board of directors levying an 1087

subject to a referendum as provided in division (F)(2) of this 1090
section. Any resolution of the board of directors levying an 1091
income tax that is adopted subsequent to one hundred eighty days 1092
after the first meeting of the board of directors shall be 1093
subject to an initiative proceeding to amend or repeal the 1094
resolution levying the income tax as provided in division (F)(2) 1095
of this section. When a referendum petition, signed by ten per 1096
cent of the number of electors in the district who voted for the 1097
office of governor at the most recent general election for the 1098
office of governor, is filed with the county auditor of each 1099
county within which a party to the contract is located within 1100
thirty days after the resolution is adopted by the board or when 1101
an initiative petition, signed by ten per cent of the number of 1102
electors in the district who voted for the office of governor at 1103
the most recent general election for the office of governor, is 1104
filed with the county auditor of each such county ordering that 1105
a resolution to amend or repeal a prior resolution levying an 1106
income tax be submitted to the electors within the district for 1107
their approval or rejection, the county auditor of each such 1108
county, after ten days and not later than four p.m. of the 1109
ninetieth day before the election, shall certify the text of the 1110
resolution to the board of elections of that county. The county 1111
auditor of each such county shall retain the petition. The board 1112
of elections shall submit the resolution to such electors, for 1113
their approval or rejection, at the next general, primary, or 1114
special election occurring subsequent to ninety days after the 1115
certifying of such petition to the board of elections. 1116

required before it may be imposed pursuant to this division. 1122
(4) If there are no electors residing in the district, no 1123
election for the approval or rejection of an income tax shall be 1124
held pursuant to this section, provided that where no electors 1125
reside in the district, the maximum rate of the income tax that 1126
may be levied shall not exceed one per cent. 1127
(5) The board of directors of a district levying an income 1128
tax shall enter into an agreement with one of the municipal 1129
corporations that is a party to the contract to administer, 1130
collect, and enforce the income tax on behalf of the district. 1131
The resolution levying the income tax shall provide the same 1132
credits, if any, to residents of the district for income taxes 1133
paid to other such districts or municipal corporations where the 1134
residents work, as credits provided to residents of the 1135
municipal corporation administering the income tax. 1136
(6)(a) The board shall publish or post public notice of 1137
any resolution adopted levying an income tax in a newspaper of 1138
general circulation within the district once a week for two 1139
consecutive weeks or as provided in section 7.16 of the Revised 1140
Code, before the resolution takes effect. In districts in which 1141
no newspaper is generally circulated, notice shall be 1142
accomplished by posting copies in not less than five of the most 1143
public places in the district, as determined by the board, for a 1144
period of not less than fifteen days before the effective date 1145
of the resolution. 1146

within a municipal corporation pursuant to sections 731.28 to 1150

H. B. No. 355 Page 40

731.40 of the Revised Code. 1151
(G) Membership on the board of directors does not 1152
constitute the holding of a public office or employment within 1153
the meaning of any section of the Revised Code or any charter 1154
provision prohibiting the holding of other public office or 1155
employment, and shall not constitute an interest, either direct 1156
or indirect, in a contract or expenditure of money by any 1157
municipal corporation, township, county, or other political 1158
subdivision with which the member may be connected. No member of 1159
a board of directors shall be disqualified from holding any 1160
public office or employment, nor shall such member forfeit or be 1161
disqualified from holding any such office or employment, by 1162
reason of the member's membership on the board of directors, 1163
notwithstanding any law or charter provision to the contrary. 1164
(H) The powers and authorizations granted pursuant to this 1165
section or section 715.71 of the Revised Code are in addition to 1166
and not in derogation of all other powers granted to municipal 1167
corporations and townships pursuant to law. When exercising a 1168
power or performing a function or duty under a contract 1169
authorized pursuant to this section or section 715.71 of the 1170
Revised Code, a municipal corporation may exercise all of the 1171
powers of a municipal corporation, and may perform all the 1172
functions and duties of a municipal corporation, within the 1173
district, pursuant to and to the extent consistent with the 1174

section 715.71 of the Revised Code, a township may exercise all 1177
of the powers of a township, and may perform all the functions 1178
and duties of a township, within the district, pursuant to and 1179

of directors has no powers except those specifically set forth 1181

or 5709.632 of the Revised Code on any property located within 1185
the district without the consent of the contracting parties. The 1186
prohibition for any tax exemption pursuant to this division 1187
shall not apply to any exemption filed, pending, or approved, or 1188
for which an agreement has been entered into, before the 1189
effective date of the contract entered into by the parties. 1190

other regulatory and proprietary matters that are determined, 1196
pursuant to the contract, to be for a public purpose and to be 1197
desirable with respect to the operation of the district or to 1198
facilitate new or expanded economic development in the state or 1199
the district, provided that no contract shall exempt the 1200

Code may designate property as a community entertainment 1207
district or may be amended to designate property as a community 1208

documentation described in divisions (B)(1) through (6) of 1213
section 4301.80 of the Revised Code. The public notice required 1214

section 715.71 of the Revised Code shall specify that the 1216
contract designates a community entertainment district and 1217

division (F) of section 4301.80 of the Revised Code, an area 1219
designated as a community entertainment district under a joint 1220
economic development district contract shall not lose its 1221
designation even if the contract is canceled or terminated. 1222
(K) A contract entered into pursuant to this section or 1223
section 715.71 of the Revised Code may be amended and it may be 1224
renewed, canceled, or terminated as provided in or pursuant to 1225
the contract. The contract may be amended to add property owned 1226
by one of the contracting parties to the district, or may be 1227
amended to delete property from the district whether or not one 1228
of the contracting parties owns the deleted property. The 1229
contract shall continue in existence throughout its term and 1230
shall be binding on the contracting parties and on any entities 1231
succeeding to such parties, whether by annexation, merger, or 1232
otherwise. The income tax levied by the board pursuant to this 1233
section or section 715.71 of the Revised Code shall apply in the 1234
entire district throughout the term of the contract, 1235
notwithstanding that all or a portion of the district becomes 1236
subject to annexation, merger, or incorporation. No township or 1237
municipal corporation is divested of its rights or obligations 1238
under the contract because of annexation, merger, or succession 1239
of interests. 1240
(L) After the creation of a joint economic development 1241
district described in division (A)(2) of this section, a 1242
municipal corporation that is a contracting party may cease to 1243

procedures and requirements to those set forth in section 715.70 1248

development district. Divisions (B), (C), (D)(1) to (3), and (F) 1250
of section 715.70 of the Revised Code do not apply to a joint 1251
economic development district established under this section. 1252
However, divisions (A), (D)(4), (E), (G), (H), (I), (J), (K), 1253
and (L) of section 715.70 of the Revised Code do apply to a 1254

townships may enter into a contract approved by the legislative 1257
authority of each contracting party pursuant to which they 1258
create as a joint economic development district one or more 1259
areas for the purpose of facilitating economic development to 1260
create or preserve jobs and employment opportunities and to 1261
improve the economic welfare of the people in this state and in 1262
the area of the contracting parties. The district created shall 1263
be located within the territory of one or more of the 1264
contracting parties and may consist of all or a portion of that 1265
territory. The boundaries of the district shall be described in 1266
the contract or in an addendum to the contract. The area or 1267
areas of land to be included in the district shall not include 1268
any parcel of land owned in fee by or leased to a municipal 1269
corporation or township, unless the municipal corporation or 1270
township is a party to the contract or has given its consent to 1271
have its parcel of land included in the district by the adoption 1272
of a resolution. As used in this division, "parcel of land" has 1273

Revised Code. 1275
(C) Before the legislative authority of a municipal 1276

development district under this section, it shall hold a public 1279
hearing concerning the joint economic development district 1280
contract and shall provide thirty days' public notice of the 1281

A contract creating a joint economic development district 1666
that violates this division is void and unenforceable. 1667

contracting parties adopts an ordinance or resolution approving 1669
a contract to create a district, the legislative authority of 1670
each of the contracting parties shall hold a public hearing 1671

(c) If the contract authorizes the board of directors of 1698
the district to adopt a resolution to levy an income tax within 1699
the district or within portions of the district, a schedule for 1700
the collection of the tax. 1701
(2) At least thirty days before the first public hearing 1702
is to be held by one or more legislative authorities on a 1703
proposed district, notice shall be sent in writing to each non- 1704
contracting municipal corporation that is located within one- 1705
half of one mile of the proposed district or that is identified 1706
in a water or sewer service plan or agreement as a future 1707
provider of water or sewer services to all or part of the 1708

economic development district. 1727
A contracting party may send written notice of the 1728
petitions by certified mail with return receipt requested to the 1729
last known mailing addresses of any or all of the record owners 1730
of real property located within the proposed district or the 1731

a resolution of the board of county commissioners. The 2943
resolution shall state the purpose for which the tax is to be 2944
levied and the number of years for which the tax is to be 2945
levied, or that it is for a continuing period of time. If the 2946
tax is to be levied for the purpose of providing additional 2947
general revenues and for the purpose of supporting criminal and 2948
administrative justice services, the resolution shall state the 2949
rate or amount of the tax to be apportioned to each such 2950
purpose. The rate or amount may be different for each year the 2951
tax is to be levied, but the rates or amounts actually 2952
apportioned each year shall not be different from that stated in 2953
the resolution for that year. Any amount by which the rate of 2954
the tax exceeds one per cent shall be apportioned exclusively 2955
for the construction, operation, acquisition, equipping, or 2956
repair of a detention facility in the county. 2957

one per cent may not be adopted as an emergency measure. 2968
Prior to the adoption of any resolution under this 2969
section, the board of county commissioners shall conduct two 2970

If the question submitted to electors proposes a school 5461
district income tax only on the taxable income of individuals as 5462
defined in division (E)(1)(b) of section 5748.01 of the Revised 5463
Code, the form of the ballot shall be modified by stating that 5464
the tax is to be levied on the "earned income of individuals 5465
residing in the school district" in lieu of the "school district 5466
income of individuals and of estates." 5467
(J)(1) If the electors of the school district approve a 5468
question under this section, and if the last calendar year the 5469
school district income tax is in effect and the last calendar 5470
year in which the property tax is collected are the same, the 5471
board of education of the school district may propose to submit 5472
under this section the combined question of all of the 5473
following: 5474
(a) The renewal of the school district income tax levied 5475

As Introduced
under this section, to take effect upon the expiration of the 5476
existing income tax; 5477
(b) The renewal of the property tax levied under this 5478
section, to be levied beginning in the tax year after the tax 5479
year in which the existing property tax expires; 5480
(c) The renewal of a property tax levied under section 5481
5705.194 of the Revised Code, regardless of the year it expires, 5482
to be levied beginning in the same tax year that the tax 5483
described in division (J)(1)(b) of this section is first levied. 5484
If the combined question is approved, the existing tax 5485
levied under section 5705.194 of the Revised Code may not be 5486
levied for the first tax year the renewal tax is levied or any 5487
following tax year. 5488
(2) In its resolution to be submitted to the tax 5489
commissioner and county auditor, the board of education shall 5490
include, in addition to the applicable requirements of division 5491
(A) of this section, a declaration of the necessity for the 5492
renewal of the property tax levied under section 5705.194 of the 5493
Revised Code, the purpose of the tax as specified under that 5494
section, and the necessity of the submission of the question of 5495
the renewal of the school district income tax and both property 5496
taxes to the electors of the district at a special election. Not 5497
later than ten days after receipt of the resolution, the county 5498
auditor shall make a separate calculation and certification with 5499
respect to the renewal tax described in division (J)(1)(c) of 5500
this section in the same manner as required by section 5705.195 5501
of the Revised Code. 5502

education shall include, in addition to the applicable 5505
requirements of division (B) of this section, a declaration that 5506
the amount of taxes that can be raised by all tax levies the 5507
district is authorized to impose, when combined with state and 5508
federal revenues, will be insufficient to provide an adequate 5509
amount for the present and future requirements of the school 5510
district, and that it is therefore necessary to renew the 5511
existing property tax being levied in excess of the ten-mill 5512
limitation under section 5705.194 of the Revised Code for the 5513
purpose as specified in that section, for a specified number of 5514
years not exceeding ten or for a continuing period of time, and 5515
that the question of the renewal of the school district income 5516
tax and of both property taxes shall be submitted to the 5517
electors of the school district at a special election as 5518
described in division (B) of this section. With respect to the 5519
renewal tax described in division (J)(1)(c) of this section, the 5520
resolution shall specify the amount of money it is necessary to 5521
raise for the specified purpose for each calendar year the 5522
millage is to be imposed, the tax year that tax is to be first 5523
levied, and the estimated rate of that tax, expressed in dollars 5524
for each one hundred thousand dollars of the county auditor's 5525
appraised value as well as in mills for each one dollar of 5526
taxable value, as certified by the county auditor. 5527
(3) In addition to the requirements of division (C) of 5528

with respect to the renewal tax described in division (J)(1)(c) 5530
of this section, the annual proceeds of the proposed levy for 5531
the specified purpose; the number of years the proposed tax will 5532

auditor's appraised value as well as in mills for each one 5536
dollar of taxable value, as certified by the county auditor. 5537
(4) The form of the ballot on a question submitted to the 5538
electors under division (J) of this section shall be identical 5539
to the form of the ballot prescribed in division (I) of this 5540
section, except that the following shall be added after the 5541
