waived all objections to the admissibility of testimony or 3481
examination reports that constitute privileged communications. 3482
If it has reason to believe that any individual authorized 3483
to practice by this chapter or any applicant for licensure or 3484
certification to practice suffers such impairment, the board 3485
shall refer the individual to the monitoring organization that 3486
conducts the confidential monitoring program established under 3487

Section 224:
section 4731.25 of the Revised Code. The board also may compel 3488
the individual to submit to a mental or physical examination, or 3489
both. The expense of the examination is the responsibility of 3490
the individual compelled to be examined. Any mental or physical 3491
examination required under this division shall be undertaken by 3492
a treatment provider or physician who is qualified to conduct 3493
the examination and who is approved under section 4731.251 of 3494
the Revised Code. 3495
Failure to submit to a mental or physical examination 3496
ordered by the board constitutes an admission of the allegations 3497
against the individual unless the failure is due to 3498
circumstances beyond the individual's control, and a default and 3499
final order may be entered without the taking of testimony or 3500
presentation of evidence. If the board determines that the 3501
individual's ability to practice is impaired, the board shall 3502
suspend the individual's license or certificate or deny the 3503
individual's application and shall require the individual, as a 3504
condition for initial, continued, reinstated, or renewed 3505
licensure or certification to practice, to submit to treatment. 3506
Before being eligible to apply for reinstatement of a 3507

license or certificate suspended under this division, the 3508
impaired practitioner shall demonstrate to the board the ability 3509
to resume practice in compliance with acceptable and prevailing 3510
standards of care under the provisions of the practitioner's 3511
license or certificate. The demonstration shall include, but 3512
shall not be limited to, the following: 3513
(a) Certification from a treatment provider approved under 3514

Section 225:

aftercare contract or consent agreement; 3518
(c) Two written reports indicating that the individual's 3519
ability to practice has been assessed and that the individual 3520
has been found capable of practicing according to acceptable and 3521
prevailing standards of care. The reports shall be made by 3522
individuals or providers approved by the board for making the 3523
assessments and shall describe the basis for their 3524
determination. 3525
The board may reinstate a license or certificate suspended 3526
under this division after that demonstration and after the 3527
individual has entered into a written consent agreement. 3528
When the impaired practitioner resumes practice, the board 3529
shall require continued monitoring of the individual. The 3530
monitoring shall include, but not be limited to, compliance with 3531
the written consent agreement entered into before reinstatement 3532
or with conditions imposed by board order after a hearing, and, 3533
upon termination of the consent agreement, submission to the 3534
board for at least two years of annual written progress reports 3535

this section, the commission of the act may be established by a 3683
finding by the board, pursuant to an adjudication under Chapter 3684

Section 239:
119. of the Revised Code, that the individual committed the act. 3685
The board does not have jurisdiction under those divisions if 3686
the trial court renders a final judgment in the individual's 3687
favor and that judgment is based upon an adjudication on the 3688
merits. The board has jurisdiction under those divisions if the 3689
trial court issues an order of dismissal upon technical or 3690
procedural grounds. 3691
(E) The sealing or expungement of conviction records by 3692
any court shall have no effect upon a prior board order entered 3693
under this section or upon the board's jurisdiction to take 3694
action under this section if, based upon a plea of guilty, a 3695
judicial finding of guilt, or a judicial finding of eligibility 3696
for intervention in lieu of conviction, the board issued a 3697
notice of opportunity for a hearing prior to the court's order 3698
to seal or expunge the records. The board shall not be required 3699
to seal, expunge, destroy, redact, or otherwise modify its 3700
records to reflect the court's sealing of conviction records. 3701
(F)(1) The board shall investigate evidence that appears 3702
to show that a person has violated any provision of this chapter 3703
or any rule adopted under it. Any person may report to the board 3704
in a signed writing any information that the person may have 3705
that appears to show a violation of any provision of this 3706
chapter or any rule adopted under it. In the absence of bad 3707
faith, any person who reports information of that nature or who 3708
testifies before the board in any adjudication conducted under 3709
Chapter 119. of the Revised Code shall not be liable in damages 3710
in a civil action as a result of the report or testimony. Each 3711
complaint or allegation of a violation received by the board 3712

shall be assigned a case number and shall be recorded by the 3713
board. 3714

or any rule adopted under it shall be supervised by the 3716
supervising member elected by the board in accordance with 3717

Section 240:
section 4731.02 of the Revised Code and by the secretary as 3718
provided in section 4731.39 of the Revised Code. The president 3719
may designate another member of the board to supervise the 3720
investigation in place of the supervising member. No member of 3721
the board who supervises the investigation of a case shall 3722
participate in further adjudication of the case. 3723
(3) In investigating a possible violation of this chapter 3724
or any rule adopted under this chapter, or in conducting an 3725
inspection under division (E) of section 4731.054 of the Revised 3726
Code, the board may question witnesses, conduct interviews, 3727
administer oaths, order the taking of depositions, inspect and 3728
copy any books, accounts, papers, records, or documents, issue 3729
subpoenas, and compel the attendance of witnesses and production 3730
of books, accounts, papers, records, documents, and testimony, 3731
except that a subpoena for patient record information shall not 3732
be issued without consultation with the attorney general's 3733
office and approval of the secretary of the board. 3734
(a) Before issuance of a subpoena for patient record 3735
information, the secretary shall determine whether there is 3736
probable cause to believe that the complaint filed alleges a 3737
violation of this chapter or any rule adopted under it and that 3738
the records sought are relevant to the alleged violation and 3739
material to the investigation. The subpoena may apply only to 3740
records that cover a reasonable period of time surrounding the 3741
alleged violation. 3742
H. B. No. 128 Page 129
As Introduced
(b) On failure to comply with any subpoena issued by the 3743
board and after reasonable notice to the person being 3744
subpoenaed, the board may move for an order compelling the 3745
production of persons or records pursuant to the Rules of Civil 3746
Procedure. 3747
(c) A subpoena issued by the board may be served by a 3748
sheriff, the sheriff's deputy, or a board employee or agent 3749
designated by the board. Service of a subpoena issued by the 3750
board may be made by delivering a copy of the subpoena to the 3751
person named therein, reading it to the person, or leaving it at 3752
the person's usual place of residence, usual place of business, 3753
or address on file with the board. When serving a subpoena to an 3754
applicant for or the holder of a license or certificate issued 3755
under this chapter, service of the subpoena may be made by 3756
certified mail, return receipt requested, and the subpoena shall 3757
be deemed served on the date delivery is made or the date the 3758
person refuses to accept delivery. If the person being served 3759
refuses to accept the subpoena or is not located, service may be 3760
made to an attorney who notifies the board that the attorney is 3761
representing the person. 3762
(d) A sheriff's deputy who serves a subpoena shall receive 3763
the same fees as a sheriff. Each witness who appears before the 3764
board in obedience to a subpoena shall receive the fees and 3765
mileage provided for under section 119.094 of the Revised Code. 3766
(4) All hearings, investigations, and inspections of the 3767
board shall be considered civil actions for the purposes of 3768

Section 241:

division (E) of section 4731.054 of the Revised Code is 3773
confidential and not subject to discovery in any civil action. 3774
The board shall conduct all investigations or inspections 3775
and proceedings in a manner that protects the confidentiality of 3776
patients and persons who file complaints with the board. The 3777
board shall not make public the names or any other identifying 3778
information about patients or complainants unless proper consent 3779
is given or, in the case of a patient, a waiver of the patient 3780
privilege exists under division (B) of section 2317.02 of the 3781
Revised Code, except that consent or a waiver of that nature is 3782
not required if the board possesses reliable and substantial 3783
evidence that no bona fide physician-patient relationship 3784
exists. 3785
The board may share any information it receives pursuant 3786
to an investigation or inspection, including patient records and 3787
patient record information, with law enforcement agencies, other 3788
licensing boards, and other governmental agencies that are 3789
prosecuting, adjudicating, or investigating alleged violations 3790
of statutes or administrative rules. An agency or board that 3791
receives the information shall comply with the same requirements 3792
regarding confidentiality as those with which the state medical 3793
board must comply, notwithstanding any conflicting provision of 3794
the Revised Code or procedure of the agency or board that 3795
applies when it is dealing with other information in its 3796
possession. In a judicial proceeding, the information may be 3797
admitted into evidence only in accordance with the Rules of 3798
Evidence, but the court shall require that appropriate measures 3799
are taken to ensure that confidentiality is maintained with 3800
respect to any part of the information that contains names or 3801
other identifying information about patients or complainants 3802
whose confidentiality was protected by the state medical board 3803
H. B. No. 128 Page 131
As Introduced
when the information was in the board's possession. Measures to 3804
ensure confidentiality that may be taken by the court include 3805
sealing its records or deleting specific information from its 3806
records. 3807
(6) On a quarterly basis, the board shall prepare a report 3808
that documents the disposition of all cases during the preceding 3809
three months. The report shall contain the following information 3810
for each case with which the board has completed its activities: 3811
(a) The case number assigned to the complaint or alleged 3812
violation; 3813
(b) The type of license or certificate to practice, if 3814
any, held by the individual against whom the complaint is 3815
directed; 3816
(c) A description of the allegations contained in the 3817
complaint; 3818
(d) The disposition of the case. 3819
The report shall state how many cases are still pending 3820
and shall be prepared in a manner that protects the identity of 3821
each person involved in each case. The report shall be a public 3822
record under section 149.43 of the Revised Code. 3823
(G) If the secretary and supervising member determine both 3824
of the following, they may recommend that the board suspend an 3825
individual's license or certificate to practice or certificate 3826
to recommend without a prior hearing: 3827
(1) That there is clear and convincing evidence that an 3828
individual has violated division (B) of this section; 3829
(2) That the individual's continued practice presents a 3830
danger of immediate and serious harm to the public. 3831

As Introduced
Written allegations shall be prepared for consideration by 3832
the board. The board, upon review of those allegations and by an 3833
affirmative vote of not fewer than six of its members, excluding 3834
the secretary and supervising member, may suspend a license or 3835
certificate without a prior hearing. A telephone conference call 3836
may be utilized for reviewing the allegations and taking the 3837
vote on the summary suspension. 3838
The board shall serve a written order of suspension in 3839
accordance with sections 119.05 and 119.07 of the Revised Code. 3840
The order shall not be subject to suspension by the court during 3841
pendency of any appeal filed under section 119.12 of the Revised 3842
Code. If the individual subject to the summary suspension 3843
requests an adjudicatory hearing by the board, the date set for 3844
the hearing shall be within fifteen days, but not earlier than 3845
seven days, after the individual requests the hearing, unless 3846
otherwise agreed to by both the board and the individual. 3847
Any summary suspension imposed under this division shall 3848
remain in effect, unless reversed on appeal, until a final 3849
adjudicative order issued by the board pursuant to this section 3850
and Chapter 119. of the Revised Code becomes effective. The 3851
board shall issue its final adjudicative order within seventy- 3852
five days after completion of its hearing. A failure to issue 3853
the order within seventy-five days shall result in dissolution 3854
of the summary suspension order but shall not invalidate any 3855
subsequent, final adjudicative order. 3856
(H) If the board takes action under division (B)(9), (11), 3857
or (13) of this section and the judicial finding of guilt, 3858
guilty plea, or judicial finding of eligibility for intervention 3859
in lieu of conviction is overturned on appeal, upon exhaustion 3860
of the criminal appeal, a petition for reconsideration of the 3861

order may be filed with the board along with appropriate court 3862
documents. Upon receipt of a petition of that nature and 3863
supporting court documents, the board shall reinstate the 3864
individual's license or certificate to practice. The board may 3865
then hold an adjudication under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code 3866
to determine whether the individual committed the act in 3867
question. Notice of an opportunity for a hearing shall be given 3868
in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code. If the 3869
board finds, pursuant to an adjudication held under this 3870
division, that the individual committed the act or if no hearing 3871
is requested, the board may order any of the sanctions 3872
identified under division (B) of this section. 3873
(I) The license or certificate to practice issued to an 3874
individual under this chapter and the individual's practice in 3875
this state are automatically suspended as of the date of the 3876
individual's second or subsequent plea of guilty to, or judicial 3877
finding of guilt of, a violation of section 2919.123 or 2919.124 3878
of the Revised Code. In addition, the license or certificate to 3879
practice or certificate to recommend issued to an individual 3880
under this chapter and the individual's practice in this state 3881
are automatically suspended as of the date the individual pleads 3882
guilty to, is found by a judge or jury to be guilty of, or is 3883
subject to a judicial finding of eligibility for intervention in 3884
lieu of conviction in this state or treatment or intervention in 3885

unemancipated, to believe that the age of a brother or sister to 1397
whom she requested notice be given as a specified relative 1398
instead of to one of her parents, her guardian, or her custodian 1399
was not twenty-one years of age, or to believe that the last 1400
known address of either of her parents, her guardian, her 1401
custodian, or a specified brother, sister, stepparent, or 1402
grandparent to whom she requested notice be given was incorrect. 1403
(2) It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this 1404
section that compliance with the requirements of this section 1405

continuation of her pregnancy created an emergency necessitating 1408
the immediate performance or inducement of an abortion. 1409

preponderance of the evidence that the person having hiring and 1815
firing responsibility for the employer had actual knowledge that 1816
the employee was dangerous or had been convicted of or pleaded 1817
guilty to the felony and was willful in retaining the individual 1818

correction or court. 1843
(J) The division of parole and community services shall 1844
adopt rules in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code 1845

professional organizations that the board specifies by rule. The 3360
state medical board shall obtain and keep on file current copies 3361
of the codes of ethics of the various national professional 3362
organizations. The individual whose license or certificate is 3363
being suspended or revoked shall not be found to have violated 3364
any provision of a code of ethics of an organization not 3365
appropriate to the individual's profession. 3366

ethics of a national professional organization" does not include 3368
any provision that would preclude the making of a report by a 3369
physician of an employee's use of a drug of abuse, or of a 3370
condition of an employee other than one involving the use of a 3371
drug of abuse, to the employer of the employee as described in 3372
division (B) of section 2305.33 of the Revised Code. Nothing in 3373
this division affects the immunity from civil liability 3374
conferred by that section upon a physician who makes either type 3375
of report in accordance with division (B) of that section. As 3376
used in this division, "employee," "employer," and "physician" 3377

prevailing standards of care by reason of mental illness or 3381

possible violation, shall refer any individual who is authorized 3386
to practice by this chapter or who has submitted an application 3387

pursuant to this chapter to the monitoring organization that 3388
conducts the confidential monitoring program established under 3389
section 4731.25 of the Revised Code. The board also may compel 3390
the individual to submit to a mental examination, physical 3391
examination, including an HIV test, or both a mental and a 3392
physical examination. The expense of the examination is the 3393
responsibility of the individual compelled to be examined. 3394
Failure to submit to a mental or physical examination or consent 3395
to an HIV test ordered by the board constitutes an admission of 3396
the allegations against the individual unless the failure is due 3397
to circumstances beyond the individual's control, and a default 3398
and final order may be entered without the taking of testimony 3399
or presentation of evidence. If the board finds an individual 3400
unable to practice because of the reasons set forth in this 3401
division, the board shall require the individual to submit to 3402
care, counseling, or treatment by physicians approved or 3403
designated by the board, as a condition for initial, continued, 3404
reinstated, or renewed authority to practice. An individual 3405
affected under this division shall be afforded an opportunity to 3406
demonstrate to the board the ability to resume practice in 3407
compliance with acceptable and prevailing standards under the 3408
provisions of the individual's license or certificate. For the 3409
purpose of this division, any individual who applies for or 3410
receives a license or certificate to practice under this chapter 3411
accepts the privilege of practicing in this state and, by so 3412
doing, shall be deemed to have given consent to submit to a 3413
mental or physical examination when directed to do so in writing 3414
by the board, and to have waived all objections to the 3415
admissibility of testimony or examination reports that 3416
constitute a privileged communication. 3417

condition of an employee other than one involving the use of a 3430
drug of abuse, to the employer of the employee as described in 3431
division (B) of section 2305.33 of the Revised Code. Nothing in 3432
this division affects the immunity from civil liability 3433
conferred by that section upon a physician who makes either type 3434

acceptable and prevailing standards of care because of substance 3471

For the purposes of this division, any individual 3474

examination reports that constitute privileged communications. 3482
If it has reason to believe that any individual authorized 3483
to practice by this chapter or any applicant for licensure or 3484
certification to practice suffers such impairment, the board 3485
shall refer the individual to the monitoring organization that 3486
conducts the confidential monitoring program established under 3487
section 4731.25 of the Revised Code. The board also may compel 3488
the individual to submit to a mental or physical examination, or 3489
both. The expense of the examination is the responsibility of 3490
the individual compelled to be examined. Any mental or physical 3491
examination required under this division shall be undertaken by 3492
a treatment provider or physician who is qualified to conduct 3493
the examination and who is approved under section 4731.251 of 3494
the Revised Code. 3495
Failure to submit to a mental or physical examination 3496
ordered by the board constitutes an admission of the allegations 3497
against the individual unless the failure is due to 3498
circumstances beyond the individual's control, and a default and 3499
final order may be entered without the taking of testimony or 3500
presentation of evidence. If the board determines that the 3501
individual's ability to practice is impaired, the board shall 3502
suspend the individual's license or certificate or deny the 3503
individual's application and shall require the individual, as a 3504
condition for initial, continued, reinstated, or renewed 3505
licensure or certification to practice, to submit to treatment. 3506

individuals or providers approved by the board for making the 3523

individual has entered into a written consent agreement. 3528
When the impaired practitioner resumes practice, the board 3529
shall require continued monitoring of the individual. The 3530
monitoring shall include, but not be limited to, compliance with 3531
the written consent agreement entered into before reinstatement 3532

supervising member elected by the board in accordance with 3717
section 4731.02 of the Revised Code and by the secretary as 3718
provided in section 4731.39 of the Revised Code. The president 3719

the board who supervises the investigation of a case shall 3722
participate in further adjudication of the case. 3723

Code, the board may question witnesses, conduct interviews, 3727
administer oaths, order the taking of depositions, inspect and 3728

except that a subpoena for patient record information shall not 3732
be issued without consultation with the attorney general's 3733
office and approval of the secretary of the board. 3734
(a) Before issuance of a subpoena for patient record 3735
information, the secretary shall determine whether there is 3736
probable cause to believe that the complaint filed alleges a 3737
violation of this chapter or any rule adopted under it and that 3738
the records sought are relevant to the alleged violation and 3739
material to the investigation. The subpoena may apply only to 3740

subpoenaed, the board may move for an order compelling the 3745
production of persons or records pursuant to the Rules of Civil 3746
Procedure. 3747
(c) A subpoena issued by the board may be served by a 3748
sheriff, the sheriff's deputy, or a board employee or agent 3749
designated by the board. Service of a subpoena issued by the 3750
board may be made by delivering a copy of the subpoena to the 3751
person named therein, reading it to the person, or leaving it at 3752
the person's usual place of residence, usual place of business, 3753
or address on file with the board. When serving a subpoena to an 3754
applicant for or the holder of a license or certificate issued 3755
under this chapter, service of the subpoena may be made by 3756
certified mail, return receipt requested, and the subpoena shall 3757
be deemed served on the date delivery is made or the date the 3758
person refuses to accept delivery. If the person being served 3759
refuses to accept the subpoena or is not located, service may be 3760
made to an attorney who notifies the board that the attorney is 3761
representing the person. 3762
(d) A sheriff's deputy who serves a subpoena shall receive 3763
the same fees as a sheriff. Each witness who appears before the 3764
board in obedience to a subpoena shall receive the fees and 3765
mileage provided for under section 119.094 of the Revised Code. 3766
(4) All hearings, investigations, and inspections of the 3767

division (E) of section 4731.054 of the Revised Code is 3773
confidential and not subject to discovery in any civil action. 3774
The board shall conduct all investigations or inspections 3775
and proceedings in a manner that protects the confidentiality of 3776
patients and persons who file complaints with the board. The 3777
board shall not make public the names or any other identifying 3778
information about patients or complainants unless proper consent 3779
is given or, in the case of a patient, a waiver of the patient 3780
privilege exists under division (B) of section 2317.02 of the 3781
Revised Code, except that consent or a waiver of that nature is 3782
not required if the board possesses reliable and substantial 3783
evidence that no bona fide physician-patient relationship 3784
exists. 3785
The board may share any information it receives pursuant 3786
to an investigation or inspection, including patient records and 3787
patient record information, with law enforcement agencies, other 3788
licensing boards, and other governmental agencies that are 3789
prosecuting, adjudicating, or investigating alleged violations 3790
of statutes or administrative rules. An agency or board that 3791
receives the information shall comply with the same requirements 3792
regarding confidentiality as those with which the state medical 3793
board must comply, notwithstanding any conflicting provision of 3794
the Revised Code or procedure of the agency or board that 3795
applies when it is dealing with other information in its 3796
possession. In a judicial proceeding, the information may be 3797
admitted into evidence only in accordance with the Rules of 3798
Evidence, but the court shall require that appropriate measures 3799
are taken to ensure that confidentiality is maintained with 3800
respect to any part of the information that contains names or 3801
other identifying information about patients or complainants 3802
whose confidentiality was protected by the state medical board 3803

H. B. No. 128 Page 131

ensure confidentiality that may be taken by the court include 3805
sealing its records or deleting specific information from its 3806
records. 3807
(6) On a quarterly basis, the board shall prepare a report 3808
that documents the disposition of all cases during the preceding 3809
three months. The report shall contain the following information 3810
for each case with which the board has completed its activities: 3811
(a) The case number assigned to the complaint or alleged 3812
violation; 3813
(b) The type of license or certificate to practice, if 3814
any, held by the individual against whom the complaint is 3815
directed; 3816
(c) A description of the allegations contained in the 3817
complaint; 3818
(d) The disposition of the case. 3819
The report shall state how many cases are still pending 3820
and shall be prepared in a manner that protects the identity of 3821
each person involved in each case. The report shall be a public 3822
record under section 149.43 of the Revised Code. 3823
(G) If the secretary and supervising member determine both 3824
of the following, they may recommend that the board suspend an 3825
individual's license or certificate to practice or certificate 3826
to recommend without a prior hearing: 3827
(1) That there is clear and convincing evidence that an 3828
individual has violated division (B) of this section; 3829
(2) That the individual's continued practice presents a 3830
danger of immediate and serious harm to the public. 3831

H. B. No. 128 Page 132
As Introduced
Written allegations shall be prepared for consideration by 3832
the board. The board, upon review of those allegations and by an 3833
affirmative vote of not fewer than six of its members, excluding 3834
the secretary and supervising member, may suspend a license or 3835
certificate without a prior hearing. A telephone conference call 3836
may be utilized for reviewing the allegations and taking the 3837
vote on the summary suspension. 3838
The board shall serve a written order of suspension in 3839
accordance with sections 119.05 and 119.07 of the Revised Code. 3840
The order shall not be subject to suspension by the court during 3841
pendency of any appeal filed under section 119.12 of the Revised 3842
Code. If the individual subject to the summary suspension 3843
requests an adjudicatory hearing by the board, the date set for 3844
the hearing shall be within fifteen days, but not earlier than 3845
seven days, after the individual requests the hearing, unless 3846
otherwise agreed to by both the board and the individual. 3847
Any summary suspension imposed under this division shall 3848
remain in effect, unless reversed on appeal, until a final 3849
adjudicative order issued by the board pursuant to this section 3850
and Chapter 119. of the Revised Code becomes effective. The 3851
board shall issue its final adjudicative order within seventy- 3852
five days after completion of its hearing. A failure to issue 3853
the order within seventy-five days shall result in dissolution 3854
of the summary suspension order but shall not invalidate any 3855
subsequent, final adjudicative order. 3856
(H) If the board takes action under division (B)(9), (11), 3857
or (13) of this section and the judicial finding of guilt, 3858
guilty plea, or judicial finding of eligibility for intervention 3859
in lieu of conviction is overturned on appeal, upon exhaustion 3860
of the criminal appeal, a petition for reconsideration of the 3861

order may be filed with the board along with appropriate court 3862
documents. Upon receipt of a petition of that nature and 3863
supporting court documents, the board shall reinstate the 3864
individual's license or certificate to practice. The board may 3865
then hold an adjudication under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code 3866
to determine whether the individual committed the act in 3867
question. Notice of an opportunity for a hearing shall be given 3868
in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code. If the 3869
board finds, pursuant to an adjudication held under this 3870
division, that the individual committed the act or if no hearing 3871
is requested, the board may order any of the sanctions 3872
identified under division (B) of this section. 3873
(I) The license or certificate to practice issued to an 3874
individual under this chapter and the individual's practice in 3875
this state are automatically suspended as of the date of the 3876
individual's second or subsequent plea of guilty to, or judicial 3877
finding of guilt of, a violation of section 2919.123 or 2919.124 3878
of the Revised Code. In addition, the license or certificate to 3879
practice or certificate to recommend issued to an individual 3880
under this chapter and the individual's practice in this state 3881
are automatically suspended as of the date the individual pleads 3882
guilty to, is found by a judge or jury to be guilty of, or is 3883
subject to a judicial finding of eligibility for intervention in 3884
lieu of conviction in this state or treatment or intervention in 3885

practicing without a license or certificate. 3893
The board shall notify the individual subject to the 3894
suspension in accordance with sections 119.05 and 119.07 of the 3895
Revised Code. If an individual whose license or certificate is 3896
automatically suspended under this division fails to make a 3897
timely request for an adjudication under Chapter 119. of the 3898
Revised Code, the board shall do whichever of the following is 3899
applicable: 3900
(1) If the automatic suspension under this division is for 3901
a second or subsequent plea of guilty to, or judicial finding of 3902
guilt of, a violation of section 2919.123 or 2919.124 of the 3903
Revised Code, the board shall enter an order suspending the 3904
individual's license or certificate to practice for a period of 3905
at least one year or, if determined appropriate by the board, 3906
imposing a more serious sanction involving the individual's 3907
license or certificate to practice. 3908
(2) In all circumstances in which division (I)(1) of this 3909
section does not apply, enter a final order permanently revoking 3910
the individual's license or certificate to practice. 3911
(J) If the board is required by Chapter 119. of the 3912
Revised Code to give notice of an opportunity for a hearing and 3913
if the individual subject to the notice does not timely request 3914
a hearing in accordance with section 119.07 of the Revised Code, 3915
the board is not required to hold a hearing, but may adopt, by 3916
an affirmative vote of not fewer than six of its members, a 3917
final order that contains the board's findings. In that final 3918
order, the board may order any of the sanctions identified under 3919

accompanied by a written statement of the conditions under which 3923
the individual's license or certificate to practice may be 3924
reinstated. The board shall adopt rules governing conditions to 3925
be imposed for reinstatement. Reinstatement of a license or 3926
certificate suspended pursuant to division (B) of this section 3927
requires an affirmative vote of not fewer than six members of 3928
the board. 3929
(L) When the board refuses to grant or issue a license or 3930
certificate to practice to an applicant, revokes an individual's 3931
license or certificate to practice, refuses to renew an 3932
individual's license or certificate to practice, or refuses to 3933
reinstate an individual's license or certificate to practice, 3934
the board may specify that its action is permanent. An 3935
individual subject to a permanent action taken by the board is 3936
forever thereafter ineligible to hold a license or certificate 3937
to practice and the board shall not accept an application for 3938
reinstatement of the license or certificate or for issuance of a 3939
new license or certificate. 3940

Code, all of the following apply: 3942
(1) The surrender of a license or certificate issued under 3943
this chapter shall not be effective unless or until accepted by 3944
the board. A telephone conference call may be utilized for 3945
acceptance of the surrender of an individual's license or 3946
certificate to practice. The telephone conference call shall be 3947
considered a special meeting under division (F) of section 3948
121.22 of the Revised Code. Reinstatement of a license or 3949
certificate surrendered to the board requires an affirmative 3950
vote of not fewer than six members of the board. 3951

certificate to practice in accordance with this chapter or a 3956
certificate to recommend in accordance with rules adopted under 3957
section 4731.301 of the Revised Code does not remove or limit 3958
the board's jurisdiction to take any disciplinary action under 3959
this section against the individual. 3960
(4) The placement of an individual's license on retired 3961
status, as described in section 4731.283 of the Revised Code, 3962
does not remove or limit the board's jurisdiction to take any 3963
disciplinary action against the individual with regard to the 3964
license as it existed before being placed on retired status. 3965
(5) At the request of the board, a license or certificate 3966
holder shall immediately surrender to the board a license or 3967
certificate that the board has suspended, revoked, or 3968
permanently revoked. 3969
