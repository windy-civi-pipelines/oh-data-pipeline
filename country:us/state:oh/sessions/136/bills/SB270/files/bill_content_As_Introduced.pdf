alcohol abuse education, intervention, or treatment program 418
specified by the court. During the time the child is attending a 419
program described in this division, the court shall retain the 420
child's temporary instruction permit, probationary driver's 421
license, or driver's license, and the court shall return the 422
permit or license if it terminates the suspension as described 423
in this division. 424
(C) The court may establish a victim-offender mediation 425
program in which victims and their offenders meet to discuss the 426
offense and suggest possible restitution. If the court obtains 427
the assent of the victim of the delinquent act committed by the 428
child, the court may require the child to participate in the 429
program. 430
(D)(1) If a child is adjudicated a delinquent child for 431
committing an act that would be a felony if committed by an 432
adult and if the child caused, attempted to cause, threatened to 433
cause, or created a risk of physical harm to the victim of the 434
act, the court, prior to issuing an order of disposition under 435
this section, shall order the preparation of a victim impact 436
statement by the probation department of the county in which the 437

S. B. No. 270 Page 16
As Introduced
victim of the act resides, by the court's own probation 438
department, or by a victim assistance program that is operated 439
by the state, a county, a municipal corporation, or another 440
governmental entity. The court shall consider the victim impact 441
statement in determining the order of disposition to issue for 442
the child. 443
(2) Each victim impact statement shall identify the victim 444
of the act for which the child was adjudicated a delinquent 445
child, itemize any economic loss suffered by the victim as a 446
result of the act, identify any physical injury suffered by the 447
victim as a result of the act and the seriousness and permanence 448
of the injury, identify any change in the victim's personal 449
welfare or familial relationships as a result of the act and any 450
psychological impact experienced by the victim or the victim's 451
family as a result of the act, and contain any other information 452
related to the impact of the act upon the victim that the court 453
requires. 454
(3) A victim impact statement shall be kept confidential 455
and is not a public record. However, the court may furnish 456
copies of the statement to the department of youth services if 457
the delinquent child is committed to the department or to both 458
the adjudicated delinquent child or the adjudicated delinquent 459
child's counsel and the prosecuting attorney. The copy of a 460
victim impact statement furnished by the court to the department 461
pursuant to this section shall be kept confidential and is not a 462
public record. If an officer is preparing pursuant to section 463
2947.06 or 2951.03 of the Revised Code or Criminal Rule 32.2 a 464
presentence investigation report pertaining to a person, the 465
court shall make available to the officer, for use in preparing 466
the report, a copy of any victim impact statement regarding that 467
person. The copies of a victim impact statement that are made 468

S. B. No. 270 Page 17
As Introduced
available to the adjudicated delinquent child or the adjudicated 469
delinquent child's counsel and the prosecuting attorney pursuant 470
to this division shall be returned to the court by the person to 471
whom they were made available immediately following the 472
imposition of an order of disposition for the child under this 473
chapter. 474
The copy of a victim impact statement that is made 475
available pursuant to this division to an officer preparing a 476
criminal presentence investigation report shall be returned to 477
the court by the officer immediately following its use in 478
preparing the report. 479
(4) The department of youth services shall work with local 480
probation departments and victim assistance programs to develop 481
a standard victim impact statement. 482
(E)(1) If a child is adjudicated a delinquent child for 483
violating a court order regarding the child's prior adjudication 484
as an unruly child for being a habitual truant and the court 485
determines that the parent, guardian, or other person having 486
care of the child has failed to cause the child's attendance at 487
school in violation of section 3321.38 of the Revised Code, in 488
addition to any order of disposition it makes under this 489
section, the court shall warn the parent, guardian, or other 490
person having care of the child that any subsequent adjudication 491
with regard to truancy may result in a criminal charge against 492
the parent, guardian, or other person having care of the child 493
for a violation of division (C) of section 2919.21 or section 494
2919.24 of the Revised Code. 495
(2) Not later than ten days after a child is adjudicated a 496
delinquent child for violating a court order regarding the 497
child's prior adjudication as an unruly child for being an 498

habitual truant, the court shall provide notice of that fact to 499
the school district in which the child is entitled to attend 500
school and to the school in which the child was enrolled at the 501
time of the filing of the complaint. 502
(F)(1) During the period of a delinquent child's community 503
control granted under this section, authorized probation 504
officers who are engaged within the scope of their supervisory 505
duties or responsibilities may search, with or without a 506
warrant, the person of the delinquent child, the place of 507
residence of the delinquent child, and a motor vehicle, another 508
item of tangible or intangible personal property, or other real 509
property in which the delinquent child has a right, title, or 510
interest or for which the delinquent child has the express or 511
implied permission of a person with a right, title, or interest 512
to use, occupy, or possess if the probation officers have 513
reasonable grounds to believe that the delinquent child is not 514
abiding by the law or otherwise is not complying with the 515
conditions of the delinquent child's community control. The 516
court that places a delinquent child on community control under 517
this section shall provide the delinquent child with a written 518
notice that informs the delinquent child that authorized 519
probation officers who are engaged within the scope of their 520
supervisory duties or responsibilities may conduct those types 521
of searches during the period of community control if they have 522
reasonable grounds to believe that the delinquent child is not 523
abiding by the law or otherwise is not complying with the 524
conditions of the delinquent child's community control. The 525
court also shall provide the written notice described in 526
division (E)(2) of this section to each parent, guardian, or 527
custodian of the delinquent child who is described in that 528
division. 529

S. B. No. 270 Page 19
As Introduced
(2) The court that places a child on community control 530
under this section shall provide the child's parent, guardian, 531
or other custodian with a written notice that informs them that 532
authorized probation officers may conduct searches pursuant to 533
division (E)(1) of this section. The notice shall specifically 534
state that a permissible search might extend to a motor vehicle, 535
another item of tangible or intangible personal property, or a 536
place of residence or other real property in which a notified 537
parent, guardian, or custodian has a right, title, or interest 538
and that the parent, guardian, or custodian expressly or 539
impliedly permits the child to use, occupy, or possess. 540
(G) If a juvenile court commits a delinquent child to the 541
custody of any person, organization, or entity pursuant to this 542
section and if the delinquent act for which the child is so 543
committed is a sexually oriented offense or is a child-victim 544
oriented offense, the court in the order of disposition shall do 545
one of the following: 546
(1) Require that the child be provided treatment as 547
described in division (A)(2) of section 5139.13 of the Revised 548
Code; 549
(2) Inform the person, organization, or entity that it is 550
the preferred course of action in this state that the child be 551
provided treatment as described in division (A)(2) of section 552
5139.13 of the Revised Code and encourage the person, 553
organization, or entity to provide that treatment. 554
Sec. 2152.22. (A) When a child is committed to the legal 555
custody of the department of youth services under this chapter, 556
the juvenile court relinquishes control with respect to the 557
child so committed, except as provided in divisions (B), (C), 558
(D), and (H) of this section or in sections 2152.82 to 2152.86 559

of the Revised Code. Subject to divisions (B), (C), and (D) of 560
this section, sections 2151.353 and 2151.412 to 2151.421 of the 561
Revised Code, sections 2152.82 to 2152.86 of the Revised Code, 562
and any other provision of law that specifies a different 563
duration for a dispositional order, all other dispositional 564
orders made by the court under this chapter shall be temporary 565
and shall continue for a period that is designated by the court 566
in its order, until terminated or modified by the court or until 567
the child attains twenty-one years of age. 568
The department shall not release the child from a 569
department facility and as a result shall not discharge the 570
child or order the child's release on supervised release prior 571
to the expiration of the minimum period specified by the court 572
in division (A)(1) of section 2152.16 of the Revised Code and 573
any term of commitment imposed under division (A)(2) or (3), 574
(B), (C), or (D)(1) of section 2152.17 of the Revised Code or 575
prior to the child's attainment of twenty-one years of age, 576
except upon the order of a court pursuant to division (B), (C), 577
or (D) of this section or in accordance with section 5139.54 of 578
the Revised Code. 579
(B)(1) Unless the court grants judicial release under 580
division (D)(1)(b) of this section, the court that commits a 581
delinquent child to the department of youth services may grant 582
judicial release of the child to court supervision under this 583
division during the first half of the prescribed minimum term 584
for which the child was committed to the department or, if the 585
child was committed to the department until the child attains 586
twenty-one years of age, during the first half of the prescribed 587
period of commitment that begins on the first day of commitment 588
and ends on the child's twenty-first birthday, provided any 589
commitment imposed under division (A)(2) or (3), (B), (C), or 590

(D)(1) of section 2152.17 of the Revised Code has ended. 591
(2) If the department desires to release a child during a 592
period specified in division (B)(1) of this section, it shall 593
request the court that committed the child to grant a judicial 594
release of the child to court supervision under this division. 595
During whichever of those periods is applicable, the child or 596
the parents of the child also may request that court to grant a 597
judicial release of the child to court supervision. Upon receipt 598
of a request for a judicial release to court supervision under 599
this division from the department, the child, or the child's 600
parent, or upon its own motion, the court that committed the 601
child shall do one of the following: approve the release by 602
journal entry; schedule within thirty days after the request is 603
received a time for a hearing on whether the child is to be 604
released; or reject the request by journal entry without 605
conducting a hearing. 606
If the court rejects an initial request for a release 607
under this division by the child or the child's parent, the 608
child or the child's parent may make one additional request for 609
a judicial release to court supervision within the applicable 610
period. The additional request may be made no earlier than 611
thirty days after the filing of the prior request for a judicial 612
release to court supervision. Upon the filing of a second 613
request for a judicial release to court supervision, the court 614
shall either approve or disapprove the release by journal entry 615
or schedule within thirty days after the request is received a 616
time for a hearing on whether the child is to be released. 617
(3) If a court schedules a hearing under division (B)(2) 618
of this section, it may order the department to deliver the 619
child to the court on the date set for the hearing and may order 620

S. B. No. 270 Page 22
As Introduced
the department to present to the court a report on the child's 621
progress in the institution to which the child was committed and 622
recommendations for conditions of supervision of the child by 623
the court after release. The court may conduct the hearing 624
without the child being present. The court shall determine at 625
the hearing whether the child should be granted a judicial 626
release to court supervision. 627
If the court approves the release under this division, it 628
shall order its staff to prepare a written treatment and 629
rehabilitation plan for the child that may include any 630
conditions of the child's release that were recommended by the 631
department and approved by the court. The committing court shall 632
send the juvenile court of the county in which the child is 633
placed a copy of the recommended plan. The court of the county 634
in which the child is placed may adopt the recommended 635
conditions set by the committing court as an order of the court 636
and may add any additional consistent conditions it considers 637
appropriate. If a child is granted a judicial release to court 638
supervision, the release discharges the child from the custody 639
of the department of youth services. 640
(C)(1) Unless the court grants judicial release under 641
division (D)(1)(b) of this section, the court that commits a 642
delinquent child to the department of youth services may grant 643
judicial release of the child to department of youth services 644
supervision under this division during the second half of the 645
prescribed minimum term for which the child was committed to the 646
department or, if the child was committed to the department 647
until the child attains twenty-one years of age, during the 648
second half of the prescribed period of commitment that begins 649
on the first day of commitment and ends on the child's twenty- 650
first birthday, provided any commitment imposed under division 651

(A)(2) or (3), (B), (C), or (D)(1) of section 2152.17 of the 652
Revised Code has ended. 653
(2) If the department desires to release a child during a 654
period specified in division (C)(1) of this section, it shall 655
request the court that committed the child to grant a judicial 656
release to department of youth services supervision. During 657
whichever of those periods is applicable, the child or the 658
child's parent also may request the court that committed the 659
child to grant a judicial release to department of youth 660
services supervision. Upon receipt of a request for judicial 661
release to department of youth services supervision, the child, 662
or the child's parent, or upon its own motion at any time during 663
that period, the court shall do one of the following: approve 664
the release by journal entry; schedule a time within thirty days 665
after receipt of the request for a hearing on whether the child 666
is to be released; or reject the request by journal entry 667
without conducting a hearing. 668
If the court rejects an initial request for release under 669
this division by the child or the child's parent, the child or 670
the child's parent may make one or more subsequent requests for 671
a release within the applicable period, but may make no more 672
than one request during each period of ninety days that the 673
child is in a secure department facility after the filing of a 674
prior request for early release. Upon the filing of a request 675
for release under this division subsequent to an initial 676
request, the court shall either approve or disapprove the 677
release by journal entry or schedule a time within thirty days 678
after receipt of the request for a hearing on whether the child 679
is to be released. 680
(3) If a court schedules a hearing under division (C)(2) 681

S. B. No. 270 Page 24
As Introduced
of this section, it may order the department to deliver the 682
child to the court on the date set for the hearing and shall 683
order the department to present to the court at that time a 684
treatment plan for the child's post-institutional care. The 685
court may conduct the hearing without the child being present. 686
The court shall determine at the hearing whether the child 687
should be granted a judicial release to department of youth 688
services supervision. 689
If the court approves the judicial release to department 690
of youth services supervision, the department shall prepare a 691
written treatment and rehabilitation plan for the child pursuant 692
to division (F) of this section that shall include the 693
conditions of the child's release. It shall send the committing 694
court and the juvenile court of the county in which the child is 695
placed a copy of the plan. The court of the county in which the 696
child is placed may adopt the conditions set by the department 697
as an order of the court and may add any additional consistent 698
conditions it considers appropriate, provided that the court may 699
not add any condition that decreases the level or degree of 700
supervision specified by the department in its plan, that 701
substantially increases the financial burden of supervision that 702
will be experienced by the department, or that alters the 703
placement specified by the department in its plan. If the court 704
of the county in which the child is placed adds to the 705
department's plan any additional conditions, it shall enter 706
those additional conditions in its journal and shall send to the 707
department a copy of the journal entry of the additional 708
conditions. 709
If the court approves the judicial release to department 710
of youth services supervision, the actual date on which the 711
department shall release the child is contingent upon the 712

S. B. No. 270 Page 25
As Introduced
department finding a suitable placement for the child. If the 713
child is to be returned to the child's home, the department 714
shall return the child on the date that the court schedules for 715
the child's release or shall bear the expense of any additional 716
time that the child remains in a department facility. If the 717
child is unable to return to the child's home, the department 718
shall exercise reasonable diligence in finding a suitable 719
placement for the child, and the child shall remain in a 720
department facility while the department finds the suitable 721
placement. 722
(D)(1) Subject to division (D)(3) of this section, the 723
court that commits a delinquent child to the department of youth 724
services may grant judicial release of the child under this 725
division at any time after the expiration of one of the 726
following periods of time: 727
(a) Except as otherwise provided in division (D)(1)(b) of 728
this section, if the child was committed to the department for a 729
prescribed minimum period and a maximum period not to exceed the 730
child's attainment of twenty-one years, the court may grant 731
judicial release of the child at any time after the expiration 732
of the prescribed minimum term for which the child was committed 733
to the department. 734
(b) If the child was committed to the department for both 735
one or more definite periods under division (A)(2) or (3), (B), 736
(C), or (D)(1) of section 2152.17 of the Revised Code and a 737
period of the type described in division (D)(1)(a) of this 738
section, all of the prescribed minimum periods of commitment 739
imposed under division (A)(2) or (3), (B), (C), or (D)(1) of 740
section 2152.17 of the Revised Code and the prescribed period of 741
commitment of the type described in division (D)(1)(a) of this 742

section shall be aggregated for purposes of this division, and 743
the court may grant judicial release of the child at any time 744
after the expiration of one year after the child begins serving 745
the aggregate period of commitment. 746
(2) If a court grants a judicial release of a child under 747
division (D)(1) of this section, the release shall be a judicial 748
release to department of youth services supervision, if the 749
release is granted during a period described in division (C)(1) 750
of this section, and the second and third paragraphs of division 751
(C)(3) of this section apply regarding the release. In all other 752
cases, the release shall be a judicial release to court 753
supervision, and the second paragraph of division (B)(3) of this 754
section applies regarding the release. 755
(3) A court at the time of making the disposition of a 756
child shall provide notice in the order of disposition that the 757
judge is retaining jurisdiction over the child for the purpose 758
of a possible grant of judicial release of the child under 759
division (D)(1) of this section. The failure of a court to 760
provide this notice does not affect the authority of the court 761
to grant a judicial release under that division and does not 762
constitute grounds for setting aside the child's delinquent 763
child adjudication or disposition or for granting any post- 764
adjudication relief to the child. 765
(4) The department of youth services, a child committed to 766
the department, or the parents of the child, during a period 767
specified in division (D)(1) of this section, may request the 768
court that committed the child to grant a judicial release of 769
the child under that division. Upon receipt of a request for 770
judicial release of a child under this division from the 771
department, the child, or the child's parent, or upon its own 772

following: 774
(a) Approve the request by journal entry; 775
(b) Schedule within thirty days after the request is 776
received a time for a hearing on whether the child is to be 777
released; 778
(c) Reject the request by journal entry without conducting 779
a hearing. 780
If the court rejects an initial request for a release 781
under this division by the child or the child's parent, division 782
(C)(2) of this section applies regarding the making of 783
additional requests. 784
If the court schedules a hearing under this division to 785
consider the judicial release, the first paragraph of division 786
(B)(3) of this section applies regarding the hearing. 787
(E) If a child is released under division (B), (C), or (D) 788
of this section and the court of the county in which the child 789
is placed has reason to believe that the child's deportment is 790
not in accordance with the conditions of the child's judicial 791
release, the court of the county in which the child is placed 792
shall schedule a time for a hearing to determine whether the 793
child violated any of the post-release conditions, and, if the 794
child was released under division (C) of this section or under 795
division (D) of this section under department supervision, 796
divisions (A) to (E) of section 5139.52 of the Revised Code 797
apply regarding the child. 798
If that court determines at the hearing that the child 799
violated any of the post-release conditions, the court, if it 800
determines that the violation was a serious violation, may order 801

S. B. No. 270 Page 28

the child to be returned to the department for 802
institutionalization, consistent with the original order of 803
commitment of the child, or in any case may make any other 804
disposition of the child authorized by law that the court 805
considers proper. If the court of the county in which the child 806
is placed orders the child to be returned to a department of 807
youth services institution, the time during which the child was 808
held in a secure department facility prior to the child's 809
judicial release shall be considered as time served in 810
fulfilling the prescribed period of institutionalization that is 811
applicable to the child under the child's original order of 812
commitment. If the court orders the child returned to a 813
department institution, the child shall remain in institutional 814
care for a minimum of three months or until the child 815
successfully completes a revocation program of a duration of not 816
less than thirty days operated either by the department or by an 817
entity with which the department has contracted to provide a 818
revocation program. 819
(F) The department of youth services, prior to the release 820
of a child pursuant to division (C) of this section or pursuant 821
to division (D) of this section on department supervision, shall 822
do all of the following: 823
(1) After reviewing the child's rehabilitative progress 824
history and medical and educational records, prepare a written 825
treatment and rehabilitation plan for the child that includes 826
conditions of the release; 827
(2) Completely discuss the conditions of the plan prepared 828
pursuant to division (F)(1) of this section and the possible 829
penalties for violation of the plan with the child and the 830
child's parents, guardian, or legal custodian; 831

(3) Have the plan prepared pursuant to division (F)(1) of 832
this section signed by the child, the child's parents, legal 833
guardian, or custodian, and any authority or person that is to 834
supervise, control, and provide supportive assistance to the 835
child at the time of the child's release pursuant to division 836
(C) or (D) of this section; 837
(4) Prior to the child's release, file a copy of the 838
treatment plan prepared pursuant to division (F)(1) of this 839
section with the committing court and the juvenile court of the 840
county in which the child is to be placed. 841
(G) The department of youth services shall file a written 842
progress report with the committing court regarding each child 843
released pursuant to division (C) of this section or released 844
pursuant to division (D) of this section on judicial release to 845
department supervision at least once every thirty days unless 846
specifically directed otherwise by the court. The report shall 847
indicate the treatment and rehabilitative progress of the child 848
and the child's family, if applicable, and shall include any 849
suggestions for altering the program, custody, living 850
arrangements, or treatment. The department shall retain legal 851
custody of a child so released until it discharges the child or 852
until the custody is terminated as otherwise provided by law. 853
(H) When a child is committed to the legal custody of the 854
department of youth services, the court retains jurisdiction to 855
perform the functions specified in section 5139.51 of the 856
Revised Code with respect to the granting of supervised release 857
by the release authority and to perform the functions specified 858
in section 5139.52 of the Revised Code with respect to 859
violations of the conditions of supervised release granted by 860

at the center for that illness, condition, or problem. Before 1692
transferring a child to a center, the department of youth 1693
services shall include in the minutes a record of the order of 1694
transfer and the reason for the transfer and, except in 1695
emergency situations, at least seven days prior to the transfer, 1696
shall send a certified copy of the order to the person shown by 1697
its records to have had the care or custody of the child 1698
immediately prior to the child's commitment. If the transfer of 1699
the child occurs in an emergency situation, as soon as possible 1700
after the decision is made to make the transfer, the department 1701
of youth services shall send a certified copy of the order to 1702
the person shown by its records to have had the care or custody 1703
of the child immediately prior to the child's commitment. A 1704
transfer under this division shall be in accordance with the 1705
terms of the agreement the department of youth services enters 1706
into with the department of rehabilitation and correction under 1707
section 5120.162 of the Revised Code and shall continue only as 1708
long as the child reasonably appears to receive benefit from 1709
diagnosis or treatment at the center for an illness, physical 1710
condition, or other medical problem. 1711
(3) Revoke or modify any order of the department except an 1712
order of discharge as often as conditions indicate it to be 1713
desirable; 1714
(4) If the child was committed pursuant to division (A)(1) 1715
(b), (c), (d), or (e), or (f) of section 2152.16 of the Revised 1716
Code and has been institutionalized or institutionalized in a 1717
secure facility for the prescribed minimum periods of time under 1718
the division pursuant to which the commitment was made, assign 1719

the child to a family home, a group care facility, or other 1720
place maintained under public or private auspices, within or 1721
without this state, for necessary treatment and rehabilitation, 1722
the costs of which may be paid by the department, provided that 1723
the department shall notify the committing court, in writing, of 1724
the place and terms of the assignment at least fifteen days 1725
prior to the scheduled date of the assignment; 1726
(5) Release the child from an institution in accordance 1727
with sections 5139.51 to 5139.54 of the Revised Code in the 1728
circumstances described in those sections. 1729
(D) The department of youth services shall notify the 1730
committing court of any order transferring the physical location 1731
of any child committed to it in accordance with section 5139.35 1732
of the Revised Code. Upon the discharge from its custody and 1733
control, the department may petition the court for an order 1734
terminating its custody and control. 1735
Sec. 5139.20. (A) Notwithstanding any other provision of 1736
the Revised Code that sets forth the minimum periods or period 1737
for which a child committed to the department of youth services 1738
is to be institutionalized or institutionalized in a secure 1739
facility or the procedures for the judicial release to court 1740
supervision or judicial release to department of youth services 1741
supervision, the department may grant emergency releases to 1742
children confined in state juvenile institutions if the 1743
governor, upon request of the director of the department 1744
authorizes the director, in writing, to issue a declaration that 1745
an emergency overcrowding condition exists in all of the 1746
institutions in which males are confined, or in all of the 1747
institutions in which females are confined, that are under the 1748
control of the department. If the governor authorizes the 1749

S. B. No. 270 Page 60
As Introduced
issuance of a declaration, the director may issue the 1750
declaration. If the director issues the declaration, the 1751
director shall file a copy of it with the secretary of state, 1752
which copy shall be a public record. Upon the filing of the 1753
copy, the department is authorized to grant emergency releases 1754
to children within its custody subject to division (B) of this 1755
section. The authority to grant the emergency releases shall 1756
continue until the expiration of thirty days from the day on 1757
which the declaration was filed. The director shall not issue a 1758
declaration that an emergency overcrowding condition exists 1759
unless the director determines that no other method of 1760
alleviating the overcrowding condition is available. 1761
(B)(1) If the department is authorized under division (A) 1762
of this section to grant emergency releases to children within 1763
its custody, the department shall determine which, if any, 1764
children to release under that authority only in accordance with 1765
this division and divisions (C), (D), and (E) of this section. 1766
The department, in determining which, if any, children to 1767
release, initially shall classify each child within its custody 1768
according to the degree of offense that the act for which the 1769
child is serving the period of institutionalization would have 1770
been if committed by an adult. The department then shall 1771
scrutinize individual children for emergency release, based upon 1772
their degree of offense, in accordance with the categories and 1773
the order of consideration set forth in division (B)(2) of this 1774
section. After scrutiny of all children within the particular 1775
category under consideration, the department shall designate 1776
individual children within that category to whom it wishes to 1777
grant an emergency release. 1778
(2) The categories of children in the custody of the 1779
department that may be considered for emergency release under 1780

S. B. No. 270 Page 61

this section, and the order in which the categories shall be 1781
considered, are as follows: 1782
(a) Initially, only children who are not serving a period 1783
of institutionalization for an act that would have been 1784
aggravated murder, murder, or a felony of the first, second, 1785
third, or fourth degree if committed by an adult or for an act 1786
that was committed before July 1, 1996, and that would have been 1787
an aggravated felony of the first, second, or third degree if 1788
committed by an adult may be considered. 1789
(b) When all children in the category described in 1790
division (B)(2)(a) of this section have been scrutinized and all 1791
children in that category who have been designated for emergency 1792
release under division (B)(1) of this section have been so 1793
released, then all children who are not serving a period of 1794
institutionalization for an act that would have been aggravated 1795
murder, murder, or a felony of the first or second degree if 1796
committed by an adult or for an act that was committed before 1797
July 1, 1996, and that would have been an aggravated felony of 1798
the first or second degree if committed by an adult may be 1799
considered. 1800
(c) When all children in the categories described in 1801
divisions (B)(2)(a) and (b) of this section have been 1802
scrutinized and all children in those categories who have been 1803
designated for emergency release under division (B)(1) of this 1804
section have been released, then all children who are not 1805
serving a term of institutionalization for an act that would 1806
have been aggravated murder, murder, or a felony of the first 1807
degree if committed by an adult or for an act that was committed 1808
before July 1, 1996, and that would have been an aggravated 1809
felony of the first or second degree if committed by an adult 1810

S. B. No. 270 Page 62

may be considered. 1811
(d) In no case shall the department consider for emergency 1812
release any child who is serving a term of institutionalization 1813
for an act that would have been aggravated murder, murder, or a 1814
felony of the first degree if committed by an adult or for an 1815
act that was committed before July 1, 1996, and that would have 1816
been an aggravated felony of the first degree if committed by an 1817
adult, and in no case shall the department grant an emergency 1818
release to any such child pursuant to this section. 1819
(C) An emergency release granted pursuant to this section 1820
shall consist of one of the following: 1821
(1) A supervised release under terms and conditions that 1822
the department believes conducive to law-abiding conduct; 1823
(2) A discharge of the child from the custody and control 1824
of the department if the department is satisfied that the 1825
discharge is consistent with the welfare of the individual and 1826
protection of the public; 1827
(3) An assignment to a family home, a group care facility, 1828
or other place maintained under public or private auspices, 1829
within or without this state, for necessary treatment or 1830
rehabilitation, the costs of which may be paid by the 1831
department. 1832
(D) If a child is granted an emergency release pursuant to 1833
this section, the child thereafter shall be considered to have 1834
been institutionalized or institutionalized in a secure facility 1835
for the prescribed minimum period of time under division (A)(1) 1836
(b), (c), (d), or (e), or (f) of section 2152.16 of the Revised 1837
Code, or all definite periods of commitment imposed under 1838
division (A), (B), (C), or (D) of section 2152.17 of the Revised 1839

Code plus the prescribed minimum period of time imposed under 1840
division (A)(1)(b), (c), (d), or (e), or (f) of section 2152.16 1841
of the Revised Code, whichever is applicable. The department 1842
shall retain legal custody of a child so released until it 1843
discharges the child or until its custody is terminated as 1844
otherwise provided by law. 1845
(E)(1) If a child is granted an emergency release so that 1846
the child is released on supervised release or assigned to a 1847
family home, group care facility, or other place for treatment 1848
or rehabilitation, the department shall prepare a written 1849
treatment and rehabilitation plan for the child in accordance 1850
with division (F) of section 2152.22 of the Revised Code, which 1851
shall include the conditions of the child's release or 1852
assignment, and shall send the committing court and the juvenile 1853
court of the county in which the child is placed a copy of the 1854
plan and the conditions that it fixed. The court of the county 1855
in which the child is placed may adopt the conditions as an 1856
order of the court and may add any additional consistent 1857
conditions it considers appropriate. If a child is released on 1858
supervised release or is assigned subject to specified 1859
conditions and the court of the county in which the child is 1860
placed has reason to believe that the child's deportment is not 1861
in accordance with any post-release conditions established by 1862
the court in its journal entry, the court of the county in which 1863
the child is placed, in its discretion, may schedule a time for 1864
a hearing on whether the child violated any of the post-release 1865
conditions. If that court conducts a hearing and determines at 1866
the hearing that the child violated any of the post-release 1867
conditions established in its journal entry, the court, if it 1868
determines that the violation of the conditions was a serious 1869
violation, may order the child to be returned to the department 1870

make any other disposition of the child authorized by law that 1872
the court considers proper. If the court of the county in which 1873
the child is placed orders the child to be returned to a 1874
department of youth services institution, the child shall remain 1875
institutionalized for a minimum period of three months. 1876
(2) The department also shall file a written progress 1877
report with the committing court regarding each child granted an 1878
emergency release pursuant to this section at least once every 1879
thirty days unless specifically directed otherwise by the court. 1880
The report shall include the information required of reports 1881
described in division (G) of section 2152.22 of the Revised 1882
Code. 1883
Sec. 5139.35. (A) Except as provided in division (C) of 1884
this section and division (C)(2) of section 5139.06 of the 1885
Revised Code, the department of youth services shall not place a 1886
child committed to it pursuant to section 2152.16 or divisions 1887
(A) and (B) of section 2152.17 of the Revised Code who has not 1888
been institutionalized or institutionalized in a secure facility 1889
for the prescribed minimum period of institutionalization in an 1890
institution with a less restrictive setting than that in which 1891
the child was originally placed, other than an institution under 1892
the management and control of the department, without first 1893
obtaining the prior consent of the committing court. 1894
(B) Except as provided in division (C) of this section, 1895
the department of youth services shall notify the committing 1896
court, in writing, of any placement of a child committed to it 1897
pursuant to division (A)(1)(b), (c), (d), or (e), or (f) of 1898
section 2152.16 or divisions (A) and (B) of section 2152.17 of 1899

which the child was originally placed, other than an institution 1904
under the management and control of the department, at least 1905
fifteen days before the scheduled date of placement. 1906
(C) If, pursuant to division (C)(2) of section 5139.06 of 1907
the Revised Code, the department of youth services transfers a 1908
child committed to it pursuant to division (A)(1)(b), (c), (d), 1909
or (e), or (f) of section 2152.16 or divisions (A) and (B) of 1910
section 2152.17 of the Revised Code to a correctional medical 1911
center established by the department of rehabilitation and 1912
correction, the department of youth services shall send the 1913
committing court a certified copy of the transfer order. 1914
Sec. 5139.51. (A) The release authority of the department 1915
of youth services shall not release a child who is in the 1916
custody of the department of youth services from institutional 1917
care or institutional care in a secure facility and shall not 1918
discharge the child or order the child's release on supervised 1919
release prior to the expiration of the prescribed minimum period 1920
of institutionalization or institutionalization in a secure 1921
facility or prior to the child's attainment of twenty-one years 1922
of age, whichever is applicable under the order of commitment, 1923
other than as is provided in section 2152.22 of the Revised 1924
Code. The release authority may conduct periodic reviews of the 1925
case of each child who is in the custody of the department and 1926
who is eligible for supervised release or discharge after 1927
completing the minimum period of time or period of time in an 1928
institution prescribed by the committing court. At least thirty 1929

possibility of supervised release or discharge and at least 1932
thirty days prior to conducting a release review, a release 1933
hearing, or a discharge review under division (E) of this 1934
section, the release authority shall give notice of the review 1935
or hearing to the court that committed the child, to the 1936
prosecuting attorney in the case, and to the victim of the 1937
delinquent act for which the child was committed or the victim's 1938
representative. If a child is on supervised release and has had 1939
the child's parole revoked, and if, upon release, there is 1940
insufficient time to provide the notices otherwise required by 1941
this division, the release authority, at least ten days prior to 1942
the child's release, shall provide reasonable notice of the 1943
child's release to the court that committed the child, to the 1944
prosecuting attorney in the case, and to the victim of the 1945
delinquent act for which the child was committed or the victim's 1946
representative. The court or prosecuting attorney may submit to 1947
the release authority written comments regarding, or written 1948
objections to, the supervised release or discharge of that 1949
child. Additionally, if the child was committed for an act that 1950
is a category one or category two offense, the court or 1951
prosecuting attorney orally may communicate to a representative 1952
of the release authority comments regarding, or objections to, 1953
the supervised release or discharge of the child or, if a 1954
hearing is held regarding the possible release or discharge of 1955
the child, may communicate those comments at the hearing. In 1956
conducting the review of the child's case regarding the 1957
possibility of supervised release or discharge, the release 1958
authority shall consider any comments and objections so 1959
submitted or communicated by the court or prosecutor and any 1960
statements or comments submitted or communicated under section 1961
5139.56 of the Revised Code by a victim of an act for which the 1962
child was committed to the legal custody of the department or by 1963

S. B. No. 270 Page 67
As Introduced
the victim's representative of a victim of an act of that type. 1964
The release authority shall determine the date on which a 1965
child may be placed on supervised release or discharged. If the 1966
release authority believes that a child should be placed on 1967
supervised release, it shall comply with division (B) of this 1968
section. If the release authority believes that a child should 1969
be discharged, it shall comply with division (C) or (E) of this 1970
section. If the release authority denies the supervised release 1971
or discharge of a child, it shall provide the child with a 1972
written record of the reasons for the decision. 1973
(B)(1) When the release authority decides to place a child 1974
on supervised release, consistent with division (D) of this 1975
section, the department shall prepare a written supervised 1976
release plan that specifies the terms and conditions upon which 1977
the child is to be released from an institution on supervised 1978
release and, at least thirty days prior to the release of the 1979
child on the supervised release, shall send to the committing 1980
court and the juvenile court of the county in which the child 1981
will be placed a copy of the supervised release plan and the 1982
terms and conditions of release. The juvenile court of the 1983
county in which the child will be placed, within fifteen days 1984
after its receipt of the copy of the supervised release plan, 1985
may add to the supervised release plan any additional consistent 1986
terms and conditions it considers appropriate, provided that the 1987
court may not add any term or condition that decreases the level 1988
or degree of supervision specified by the release authority in 1989
the plan, that substantially increases the financial burden of 1990
supervision that will be experienced by the department of youth 1991
services, or that alters the placement specified by the plan. 1992
If, within fifteen days after its receipt of the copy of 1993

S. B. No. 270 Page 68
As Introduced
the supervised release plan, the juvenile court of the county in 1994
which the child will be placed does not add to the supervised 1995
release plan any additional terms and conditions, the court 1996
shall enter the supervised release plan in its journal within 1997
that fifteen-day period and, within that fifteen-day period, 1998
shall send to the release authority a copy of the journal entry 1999
of the supervised release plan. The journalized plan shall apply 2000
regarding the child's supervised release. 2001
If, within fifteen days after its receipt of the copy of 2002
the supervised release plan, the juvenile court of the county in 2003
which the child will be placed adds to the supervised release 2004
plan any additional terms and conditions, the court shall enter 2005
the supervised release plan and the additional terms and 2006
conditions in its journal and, within that fifteen-day period, 2007
shall send to the release authority a copy of the journal entry 2008
of the supervised release plan and additional terms and 2009
conditions. The journalized supervised release plan and 2010
additional terms and conditions added by the court that satisfy 2011
the criteria described in this division shall apply regarding 2012
the child's supervised release. 2013
If, within fifteen days after its receipt of the copy of 2014
the supervised release plan, the juvenile court of the county in 2015
which the child will be placed neither enters in its journal the 2016
supervised release plan nor enters in its journal the supervised 2017
release plan plus additional terms and conditions added by the 2018
court, the court and the department of youth services may 2019
attempt to resolve any differences regarding the plan within 2020
three days. If a resolution is not reached within that three-day 2021
period, thereafter, the supervised release plan shall be 2022
enforceable to the same extent as if the court actually had 2023
entered the supervised release plan in its journal. 2024

(2) When the release authority receives from the court a 2025
copy of the journalized supervised release plan and, if 2026
applicable, a copy of the journalized additional terms and 2027
conditions added by the court, the release authority shall keep 2028
the original copy or copies in the child's file and shall 2029
provide a copy of each document to the child, the employee of 2030
the department who is assigned to supervise and assist the child 2031
while on release, and the committing court. 2032
(C) If a child who is in the custody of the department of 2033
youth services was committed pursuant to division (A)(1)(b), 2034
(c), (d), or (e), or (f) of section 2152.16 of the Revised Code 2035
and has been institutionalized or institutionalized in a secure 2036
facility for the prescribed minimum periods of time under those 2037
divisions and if the release authority is satisfied that the 2038
discharge of the child without the child being placed on 2039
supervised release would be consistent with the welfare of the 2040
child and protection of the public, the release authority, 2041
without approval of the court that committed the child, may 2042
discharge the child from the department's custody and control 2043
without placing the child on supervised release. Additionally, 2044
the release authority may discharge a child in the department's 2045
custody without the child being placed on supervised release if 2046
the child is removed from the jurisdiction of this state by a 2047
court order of a court of this state, another state, or the 2048
United States, or by any agency of this state, another state, or 2049
the United States, if the child is convicted of or pleads guilty 2050
to any criminal offense, or as otherwise provided by law. At 2051
least fifteen days before the scheduled date of discharge of the 2052
child without the child being placed on supervised release, the 2053
department shall notify the committing court, in writing, that 2054
it is going to discharge the child and of the reason for the 2055

S. B. No. 270 Page 70

discharge. Upon discharge of the child without the child being 2056
placed on supervised release, the department immediately shall 2057
certify the discharge in writing and shall transmit the 2058
certificate of discharge to the committing court. 2059
(D) In addition to requirements that are reasonably 2060
related to the child's prior pattern of criminal or delinquent 2061
behavior and the prevention of further criminal or delinquent 2062
behavior, the release authority shall specify the following 2063
requirements for each child whom it releases: 2064
(1) The child shall observe the law. 2065
(2) The child shall maintain appropriate contact, as 2066
specified in the written supervised release plan for that child. 2067
(3) The child shall not change residence unless the child 2068
seeks prior approval for the change from the employee of the 2069
department assigned to supervise and assist the child, provides 2070
that employee, at the time the child seeks the prior approval 2071
for the change, with appropriate information regarding the new 2072
residence address at which the child wishes to reside, and 2073
obtains the prior approval of that employee for the change. 2074
(E) The period of a child's supervised release may extend 2075
from the date of release from an institution until the child 2076
attains twenty-one years of age. If the period of supervised 2077
release extends beyond one year after the date of release, the 2078
child may request in writing that the release authority conduct 2079
a discharge review after the expiration of the one-year period 2080
or the minimum period or period. If the child so requests, the 2081
release authority shall conduct a discharge review and give the 2082
child its decision in writing. The release authority shall not 2083
grant a discharge prior to the discharge date if it finds good 2084

until the discharge date. A child may request an additional 2086
discharge review six months after the date of a previous 2087
discharge review decision, but not more than once during any 2088
six-month period after the date of a previous discharge review 2089
decision. 2090
(F) At least two weeks before the release authority places 2091
on supervised release or discharge a child who was committed to 2092
the legal custody of the department, the release authority shall 2093
provide notice of the release or discharge as follows: 2094
(1) In relation to the placement on supervised release or 2095
discharge of a child who was committed to the department for 2096
committing an act that is a category one or category two 2097
offense, the release authority shall notify, by the specified 2098
deadline, all of the following of the release or discharge: 2099
(a) The prosecuting attorney of the county in which the 2100
child was adjudicated a delinquent child and committed to the 2101
custody of the department; 2102
(b) Whichever of the following is applicable: 2103
(i) If upon the supervised release or discharge the child 2104
will reside in a municipal corporation, the chief of police or 2105
other chief law enforcement officer of that municipal 2106
corporation; 2107
(ii) If upon the supervised release or discharge the child 2108
will reside in an unincorporated area of a county, the sheriff 2109
