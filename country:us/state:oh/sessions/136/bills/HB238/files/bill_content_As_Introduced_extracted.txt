person's failure to attend the hearing or answer the 153
notification of infraction. 154
(C) Payment of any judgment or default judgment entered 155
against a person pursuant to this section shall be made to the 156
violations clerk of the parking violations bureau, joint parking 157
violations bureau, or traffic violations bureau, or to the clerk 158

As Introduced
Judgments and default judgments filed with a court 172
pursuant to this division shall be maintained in a separate 173
index and judgment roll from other judgments rendered in the 174

ten dollars for each parking infraction, to be paid upon 183
satisfaction of the judgment. 184
(D) Any person against whom a judgment or default judgment 185
is entered pursuant to this section and any local authority 186
against whom a judgment is entered pursuant to this section may 187
appeal the judgment or default judgment to the municipal court 188
or county court within whose territorial jurisdiction the 189
ordinance, resolution, or regulation was violated if the 190
judgment or default judgment was entered by a bureau, or to a 191
judge of the juvenile court within whose territorial 192
jurisdiction the ordinance, resolution, or regulation was 193
violated if the judgment or default judgment was entered by a 194
referee of a juvenile court, by filing notices of appeal with 195
the parking violations bureau, joint parking violations bureau, 196
or traffic violations bureau, or the referee of the juvenile 197
court, in which the judgment was entered, and the municipal or 198
county court or the clerk of the juvenile court within fifteen 199
days three years of the date of entry of the judgment and by the 200

H. B. No. 238 Page 8
As Introduced
judge shall schedule a hearing date and notify the parties of 203
the date, time, and place of the hearing. The hearing shall be 204
held by the court or juvenile judge in accordance with the rules 205
of the court. Service of a notice of appeal under this division 206
by a person does not stay enforcement and collection of the 207
judgment or default judgment from which appeal is taken by the 208
person unless the person who files the appeal posts bond with 209
the parking violations bureau, joint parking violations bureau, 210
or traffic violations bureau, or the juvenile court, in the 211
amount of the judgment, plus court costs, at or before service 212
of the notice of appeal. 213

on appeal of the municipal or county court or of the juvenile 215
judge is final, and no other appeal of the judgment of the 216
parking violations bureau, joint parking violations bureau, or 217
traffic violations bureau, or of the referee of the juvenile 218
court, whichever is applicable, and no appeal of the judgment of 219
the municipal or county court or of the juvenile judge may be 220
taken. 221

this section may be filed with a municipal court or county court 223
under division (C) of this section at any time within three four 224
years after the date of issuance of the parking ticket charging 225
the parking infraction out of which the judgment arose. This 226
division section applies to any ticket issued for an offense 227
that would be a parking infraction on or after the effective 228
date of this section, if amendment. If the ticket was issued 229
within three years prior to the effective date of this section 230
and a warrant has not been issued and served on the operator or 231
owner of the vehicle involved in the offenseamendment, the 232

adopt standards that authorize a person to pay parking fees at a 236
parking meter by multiple payment methods, including cash, coin, 237
credit card, quick response code, or other methods selected by 238
the director. However, in all circumstances, a person may pay 239
parking fees at a parking meter by using cash, coin, or credit 240
card, as an alternative to any other specified payment method. 241
(B) When paying to park in a parking zone, an individual 242
shall not be required to identify or provide information about 243
the parking space in which the individual's vehicle is parked. 244
(C)(1) A parking violations bureau, joint parking 245
violations bureau, or traffic violations bureau shall rescind a 246
parking ticket if both of the following apply: 247
(a) The bureau issues the ticket within three minutes of 248
the time at which an individual parked within a parking zone; 249
(b) The individual pays for parking in the parking zone 250
within that three-minute period. 251
(2) Failure of a parking violations bureau, joint parking 252
violations bureau, or traffic violations bureau to comply with 253
division (C)(1) of this section is prima facie evidence under 254

As Introduced
Judgments and default judgments filed with a court 172
pursuant to this division shall be maintained in a separate 173
index and judgment roll from other judgments rendered in the 174
court. Computer printouts, microfilm, microdot, microfiche, or 175
other similar data recording techniques may be utilized to 176
record such judgments. When a judgment or default judgment is 177
filed with a court, execution may be levied, and such other 178
measures may be taken for its collection as are authorized for 179
the collection of an unpaid money judgment in a civil action 180
rendered in that court. The municipal or county court may assess 181
costs against the judgment debtor, in an amount not exceeding 182
ten dollars for each parking infraction, to be paid upon 183
satisfaction of the judgment. 184
(D) Any person against whom a judgment or default judgment 185
is entered pursuant to this section and any local authority 186
against whom a judgment is entered pursuant to this section may 187
appeal the judgment or default judgment to the municipal court 188
or county court within whose territorial jurisdiction the 189
ordinance, resolution, or regulation was violated if the 190
judgment or default judgment was entered by a bureau, or to a 191
judge of the juvenile court within whose territorial 192
jurisdiction the ordinance, resolution, or regulation was 193
violated if the judgment or default judgment was entered by a 194
referee of a juvenile court, by filing notices of appeal with 195
the parking violations bureau, joint parking violations bureau, 196
or traffic violations bureau, or the referee of the juvenile 197
court, in which the judgment was entered, and the municipal or 198
county court or the clerk of the juvenile court within fifteen 199
days three years of the date of entry of the judgment and by the 200
payment of such reasonable costs as the court or juvenile judge 201
requires. Upon the filing of an appeal, the court or juvenile 202

judge shall schedule a hearing date and notify the parties of 203
the date, time, and place of the hearing. The hearing shall be 204
held by the court or juvenile judge in accordance with the rules 205
of the court. Service of a notice of appeal under this division 206
by a person does not stay enforcement and collection of the 207
judgment or default judgment from which appeal is taken by the 208
person unless the person who files the appeal posts bond with 209
the parking violations bureau, joint parking violations bureau, 210
or traffic violations bureau, or the juvenile court, in the 211
amount of the judgment, plus court costs, at or before service 212
of the notice of appeal. 213
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the judgment 214
on appeal of the municipal or county court or of the juvenile 215
judge is final, and no other appeal of the judgment of the 216
parking violations bureau, joint parking violations bureau, or 217
traffic violations bureau, or of the referee of the juvenile 218
court, whichever is applicable, and no appeal of the judgment of 219
the municipal or county court or of the juvenile judge may be 220
taken. 221
(E) A judgment or default judgment entered pursuant to 222
this section may be filed with a municipal court or county court 223
under division (C) of this section at any time within three four 224
years after the date of issuance of the parking ticket charging 225
the parking infraction out of which the judgment arose. This 226
division section applies to any ticket issued for an offense 227
that would be a parking infraction on or after the effective 228
date of this section, if amendment. If the ticket was issued 229
within three years prior to the effective date of this section 230
and a warrant has not been issued and served on the operator or 231
owner of the vehicle involved in the offenseamendment, the 232
version of this section that existed prior to that date applies 233

that ticket. 234
Sec. 4521.20. (A) The director of public safety shall 235
adopt standards that authorize a person to pay parking fees at a 236
parking meter by multiple payment methods, including cash, coin, 237
credit card, quick response code, or other methods selected by 238
the director. However, in all circumstances, a person may pay 239
parking fees at a parking meter by using cash, coin, or credit 240
card, as an alternative to any other specified payment method. 241
(B) When paying to park in a parking zone, an individual 242
shall not be required to identify or provide information about 243
the parking space in which the individual's vehicle is parked. 244
(C)(1) A parking violations bureau, joint parking 245
violations bureau, or traffic violations bureau shall rescind a 246
parking ticket if both of the following apply: 247
(a) The bureau issues the ticket within three minutes of 248
the time at which an individual parked within a parking zone; 249
(b) The individual pays for parking in the parking zone 250
within that three-minute period. 251
(2) Failure of a parking violations bureau, joint parking 252
violations bureau, or traffic violations bureau to comply with 253
division (C)(1) of this section is prima facie evidence under 254
4521.08 of the Revised Code that the individual to whom the 255
parking ticket was issued did not commit the parking infraction. 256
Section 2. That existing sections 4521.01 and 4521.08 of 257
the Revised Code are hereby repealed. 258
