described under this division may affect the employee's 140
eligibility for compensation and benefits pursuant to this 141

rebuttable presumption that an employee is intoxicated, under 143
the influence of a controlled substance not prescribed by the 144
employee's physician, or under the influence of marihuana and 145
that being intoxicated, under the influence of a controlled 146
substance not prescribed by the employee's physician, or under 147

As Reported by the House Commerce and Labor Committee
(2) When the employee refuses to submit to a requested 169
chemical test, on the condition that that employee is or was 170
given notice that the refusal to submit to any chemical test 171
described in division (B)(1) of this section may affect the 172
employee's eligibility for compensation and benefits under this 173
chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code. 174
(C)(1) For purposes of division (B) of this section, a 175
chemical test is a qualifying chemical test if it is 176

an employee is or was using alcohol, a controlled substance, or 191
marihuana drawn from specific, objective facts and reasonable 192
inferences drawn from these facts in light of experience and 193
training. These facts and inferences may be based on, but are 194
not limited to, any of the following: 195
(a) Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of 196
use, possession, or distribution of alcohol, a controlled 197

H. B. No. 94 Page 8
As Reported by the House Commerce and Labor Committee
substance, or marihuana, or of the physical symptoms of being 198

substance, or marihuana, and does not appear to be attributable 207
to other factors; 208
(c) The identification of an employee as the focus of a 209
criminal investigation into unauthorized possession, use, or 210

(e) Repeated or flagrant violations of the safety or work 214

employee's supervisor to pose a substantial risk of physical 216
injury or property damage and that appear to be related to the 217
use of alcohol, a controlled substance, or marihuana and that do 218
not appear attributable to other factors. 219
(D) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect 220
the rights of an employer to test employees for alcohol or 221
controlled substance abuse. 222
(E) For the purpose of this section, laboratories 223
certified by the United States department of health and human 224
services or laboratories that meet or exceed the standards of 225
that department for laboratory certification shall be used for 226

H. B. No. 94 Page 9

processing the test results of a qualifying chemical test. 227
(F) The written notice required by division (B) of this 228
section shall be the same size or larger than the proof of 229
workers' compensation coverage furnished by the bureau of 230
workers' compensation and shall be posted by the employer in the 231
same location as the proof of workers' compensation coverage or 232
the certificate of self-insurance. An employer may post the 233
written notice required by division (B) of this section on the 234
internet in a manner that is accessible to the employer's 235
employees. 236
(G) If a condition that pre-existed an injury is 237
substantially aggravated by the injury, and that substantial 238
aggravation is documented by objective diagnostic findings, 239
objective clinical findings, or objective test results, no 240
compensation or benefits are payable because of the pre-existing 241
condition once that condition has returned to a level that would 242
have existed without the injury. 243
(H)(1) Whenever, with respect to an employee of an 244
employer who is subject to and has complied with this chapter, 245
there is possibility of conflict with respect to the application 246
of workers' compensation laws because the contract of employment 247
is entered into and all or some portion of the work is or is to 248
be performed in a state or states other than Ohio, the employer 249
and the employee may agree to be bound by the laws of this state 250
or by the laws of some other state in which all or some portion 251
of the work of the employee is to be performed. The agreement 252
shall be in writing and shall be filed with the bureau of 253
workers' compensation within ten days after it is executed and 254
shall remain in force until terminated or modified by agreement 255
of the parties similarly filed. If the agreement is to be bound 256

H. B. No. 94 Page 10
As Reported by the House Commerce and Labor Committee
by the laws of this state and the employer has complied with 257
this chapter, then the employee is entitled to compensation and 258
benefits regardless of where the injury occurs or the disease is 259
contracted and the rights of the employee and the employee's 260
dependents under the laws of this state are the exclusive remedy 261
against the employer on account of injury, disease, or death in 262
the course of and arising out of the employee's employment. If 263
the agreement is to be bound by the laws of another state and 264
the employer has complied with the laws of that state, the 265
rights of the employee and the employee's dependents under the 266
laws of that state are the exclusive remedy against the employer 267
on account of injury, disease, or death in the course of and 268
arising out of the employee's employment without regard to the 269
place where the injury was sustained or the disease contracted. 270
If an employer and an employee enter into an agreement under 271
this division, the fact that the employer and the employee 272
entered into that agreement shall not be construed to change the 273
status of an employee whose continued employment is subject to 274
the will of the employer or the employee, unless the agreement 275
contains a provision that expressly changes that status. 276
(2) If an employee or the employee's dependents receive an 277
award of compensation or benefits under this chapter or Chapter 278
4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for the same injury, 279
occupational disease, or death for which the employee or the 280
employee's dependents previously pursued or otherwise elected to 281
accept workers' compensation benefits and received a decision on 282
the merits as defined in section 4123.542 of the Revised Code 283
under the laws of another state or recovered damages under the 284
laws of another state, the claim shall be disallowed and the 285
administrator or any self-insuring employer, by any lawful 286
means, may collect from the employee or the employee's 287

H. B. No. 94 Page 11
As Reported by the House Commerce and Labor Committee

(a) The amount of compensation or benefits paid to or on 289
behalf of the employee or the employee's dependents by the 290
administrator or a self-insuring employer pursuant to this 291
chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code 292
for that award; 293
(b) Any interest, attorney's fees, and costs the 294
administrator or the self-insuring employer incurs in collecting 295
that payment. 296
(3) If an employee or the employee's dependents receive an 297
award of compensation or benefits under this chapter or Chapter 298
4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code and subsequently 299
pursue or otherwise elect to accept workers' compensation 300
benefits or damages under the laws of another state for the same 301
injury, occupational disease, or death the claim under this 302
chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code 303
shall be disallowed. The administrator or a self-insuring 304
employer, by any lawful means, may collect from the employee or 305
the employee's dependents or other-states' insurer any of the 306
following: 307
(a) The amount of compensation or benefits paid to or on 308
behalf of the employee or the employee's dependents by the 309
administrator or the self-insuring employer pursuant to this 310
chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code 311
for that award; 312
(b) Any interest, costs, and attorney's fees the 313
administrator or the self-insuring employer incurs in collecting 314
that payment; 315
(c) Any costs incurred by an employer in contesting or 316

H. B. No. 94 Page 12
As Reported by the House Commerce and Labor Committee
responding to any claim filed by the employee or the employee's 317
dependents for the same injury, occupational disease, or death 318
that was filed after the original claim for which the employee 319
or the employee's dependents received a decision on the merits 320
as described in section 4123.542 of the Revised Code. 321
(4) If the employee's employer pays premiums into the 322
state insurance fund, the administrator shall not charge the 323
amount of compensation or benefits the administrator collects 324
pursuant to division (H)(2) or (3) of this section to the 325
employer's experience. If the administrator collects any costs 326
incurred by an employer in contesting or responding to any claim 327
pursuant to division (H)(2) or (3) of this section, the 328
administrator shall forward the amount collected to that 329
employer. If the employee's employer is a self-insuring 330
employer, the self-insuring employer shall deduct the amount of 331
compensation or benefits the self-insuring employer collects 332
pursuant to this division from the paid compensation the self- 333
insuring employer reports to the administrator under division 334
(L) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code. 335
(5) If an employee is a resident of a state other than 336
this state and is insured under the workers' compensation law or 337
similar laws of a state other than this state, the employee and 338
the employee's dependents are not entitled to receive 339
compensation or benefits under this chapter, on account of 340
injury, disease, or death arising out of or in the course of 341
employment while temporarily within this state, and the rights 342
of the employee and the employee's dependents under the laws of 343
the other state are the exclusive remedy against the employer on 344
account of the injury, disease, or death. 345
(6) An employee, or the dependent of an employee, who 346

H. B. No. 94 Page 13
As Reported by the House Commerce and Labor Committee
elects to receive compensation and benefits under this chapter 347
or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for a 348
claim may not receive compensation and benefits under the 349
workers' compensation laws of any state other than this state 350
for that same claim. For each claim submitted by or on behalf of 351
an employee, the administrator or, if the employee is employed 352
by a self-insuring employer, the self-insuring employer, shall 353
request the employee or the employee's dependent to sign an 354
election that affirms the employee's or employee's dependent's 355
acceptance of electing to receive compensation and benefits 356
under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the 357
Revised Code for that claim that also affirmatively waives and 358
releases the employee's or the employee's dependent's right to 359
file for and receive compensation and benefits under the laws of 360
any state other than this state for that claim. The employee or 361
employee's dependent shall sign the election form within twenty- 362
eight days after the administrator or self-insuring employer 363
submits the request or the administrator or self-insuring 364
employer shall dismiss that claim. 365
In the event a workers' compensation claim has been filed 366
in another jurisdiction on behalf of an employee or the 367
dependents of an employee, and the employee or dependents 368
subsequently elect to receive compensation, benefits, or both 369
under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the 370
Revised Code, the employee or dependent shall withdraw or refuse 371
acceptance of the workers' compensation claim filed in the other 372
jurisdiction in order to pursue compensation or benefits under 373
the laws of this state. If the employee or dependents were 374
awarded workers' compensation benefits or had recovered damages 375
under the laws of the other state, any compensation and benefits 376
awarded under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of 377

H. B. No. 94 Page 14
As Reported by the House Commerce and Labor Committee
the Revised Code shall be paid only to the extent to which those 378
payments exceed the amounts paid under the laws of the other 379
state. If the employee or dependent fails to withdraw or to 380
refuse acceptance of the workers' compensation claim in the 381
other jurisdiction within twenty-eight days after a request made 382
by the administrator or a self-insuring employer, the 383
administrator or self-insuring employer shall dismiss the 384
employee's or employee's dependents' claim made in this state. 385
(I) If an employee who is covered under the federal 386
"Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act," 98 Stat. 1639, 387
33 U.S.C. 901 et seq., is injured or contracts an occupational 388
disease or dies as a result of an injury or occupational 389
disease, and if that employee's or that employee's dependents' 390
claim for compensation or benefits for that injury, occupational 391
disease, or death is subject to the jurisdiction of that act, 392
the employee or the employee's dependents are not entitled to 393
apply for and shall not receive compensation or benefits under 394
this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code. The rights 395
of such an employee and the employee's dependents under the 396
federal "Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act," 98 397
Stat. 1639, 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq., are the exclusive remedy 398
against the employer for that injury, occupational disease, or 399
death. 400
(J) Compensation or benefits are not payable to a claimant 401
or a dependent during the period of confinement of the claimant 402
or dependent in any state or federal correctional institution, 403
or in any county jail in lieu of incarceration in a state or 404
federal correctional institution, whether in this or any other 405
state for conviction of violation of any state or federal 406
criminal law. 407

either of the following circumstances: 413
(1) The employer administers the payroll and workers' 414
compensation insurance for a professional sports team subject to 415

workers' compensation insurance that provides coverage for the 428
players and coaches of the sports league. 429

league, pursuant to the organizational or operating documents of 431
the sports league, is obligated to the sports league to pay to 432
the sports league any workers' compensation claims that are not 433
covered by the workers' compensation insurance maintained by the 434
sports league. 435
