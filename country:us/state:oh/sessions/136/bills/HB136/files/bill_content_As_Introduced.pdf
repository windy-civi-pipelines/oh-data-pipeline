conduct, upon its own initiative and independent of the filing 224
of any charges, a preliminary investigation relating to any of 225
the unlawful discriminatory practices that are not unlawful 226
discriminatory practices relating to employment and that are 227

its authority under division (B)(3)(d) of this section, the 240

charge filed pursuant to division (B)(1) of this section that 242
alleges an unlawful discriminatory practice described in 243
division (H) of section 4112.02 of the Revised Code, and shall 244

not probable that an unlawful discriminatory practice described 248

or is being engaged in and that the commission will not issue a 250
complaint in the matter; 251

or alternative dispute resolution; 254
(iii) Initiate a complaint and refer it to the attorney 255

taken, the attorney general shall apply, as expeditiously as 258
possible after receipt of the complaint, to the court of common 259
pleas of the county in which the unlawful discriminatory 260
practice allegedly occurred for the appropriate injunction or 261
order, and the court shall hear and determine the application as 262
expeditiously as possible. 263
(b) If it is not practicable to comply with the 264
requirements of division (B)(3)(a) of this section within the 265
one-hundred-day period described in that division, the 266
commission shall notify the complainant and the respondent in 267
writing of the reasons for the noncompliance. 268
(c) Prior to the issuance of a complaint under division 269
(B)(3)(a)(ii) or (iii) of this section or prior to a 270
notification of the complainant and the respondent under 271
division (B)(3)(a)(i) of this section, the members of the 272
commission and the officers and employees of the commission 273
shall not make public in any manner and shall retain as 274
confidential all information that was obtained as a result of or 275
that otherwise pertains to a preliminary investigation of a 276
charge filed pursuant to division (B)(1) of this section that 277

H. B. No. 136 Page 11
As Introduced
alleges an unlawful discriminatory practice described in 278
division (H) of section 4112.02 of the Revised Code. 279
(d) Notwithstanding the types of action described in 280
divisions (B)(3)(a)(ii) and (iii) of this section, prior to the 281
issuance of a complaint or the referral of a complaint to the 282
attorney general and prior to endeavoring to eliminate an 283
unlawful discriminatory practice described in division (H) of 284
section 4112.02 of the Revised Code by informal methods of 285
conference, conciliation, mediation, and persuasion, or by 286
alternative dispute resolution, the commission may seek a 287
temporary or permanent injunction or a temporary restraining 288
order in the court of common pleas of the county in which the 289
unlawful discriminatory practice allegedly occurred. 290
(4) If the commission determines after a preliminary 291
investigation other than one concerning an alleged unlawful 292
discriminatory practice relating to employment or one described 293
in division (B)(3) of this section that it is not probable that 294
an unlawful discriminatory practice has been or is being engaged 295
in, it shall notify any complainant under division (B)(1) of 296
this section that it has so determined and that it will not 297
issue a complaint in the matter. If the commission determines 298
after a preliminary investigation other than one concerning an 299
alleged unlawful discriminatory practice relating to employment 300
or one described in division (B)(3) of this section that it is 301
probable that an unlawful discriminatory practice has been or is 302
being engaged in, it shall endeavor to eliminate the practice by 303
informal methods of conference, conciliation, mediation, and 304
persuasion, or by alternative dispute resolution. 305
(5) Nothing said or done during informal methods of 306
conference, conciliation, mediation, and persuasion, or during 307

H. B. No. 136 Page 12
As Introduced
alternative dispute resolution, under this section shall be 308
disclosed by any member of the commission or its staff or be 309
used as evidence in any subsequent hearing or other proceeding. 310
If, after a preliminary investigation and the use of informal 311
methods of conference, conciliation, mediation, and persuasion, 312
or alternative dispute resolution, under this section, the 313
commission is satisfied that any unlawful discriminatory 314
practice will be eliminated, it may treat the charge involved as 315
being conciliated and enter that disposition on the records of 316
the commission. If the commission fails to effect the 317
elimination of an unlawful discriminatory practice by informal 318
methods of conference, conciliation, mediation, and persuasion, 319
or by alternative dispute resolution under this section and to 320
obtain voluntary compliance with this chapter, the commission 321
shall issue and cause to be served upon any person, including 322
the respondent against whom a complainant has filed a charge 323
pursuant to division (B)(1) of this section, a complaint stating 324
the charges involved and containing a notice of an opportunity 325
for a hearing before the commission, a member of the commission, 326
or a hearing examiner at a place that is stated in the notice 327
and that is located within the county in which the alleged 328
unlawful discriminatory practice has occurred or is occurring or 329
in which the respondent resides or transacts business. The 330
hearing shall be held not less than thirty days after the 331
service of the complaint upon the complainant, the aggrieved 332
persons other than the complainant on whose behalf the complaint 333
is issued, and the respondent, unless the complainant, an 334
aggrieved person, or the respondent elects to proceed under 335
division (A)(2) of section 4112.055 of the Revised Code when 336
that division is applicable. If a complaint pertains to an 337
alleged unlawful discriminatory practice described in division 338
