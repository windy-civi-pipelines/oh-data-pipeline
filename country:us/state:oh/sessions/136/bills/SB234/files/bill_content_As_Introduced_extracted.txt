employee's county of residence, for any violation of Section 34a 397
of Article II, Ohio Constitution, or any law or regulation 398
implementing its provisions within three years of the violation 399
or of when the violation ceased if it was of a continuing 400
nature, or within one year after notification to the employee of 401

person acting on behalf of all similarly situated employees 410
unless that employee first gives written consent to become such 411
a party plaintiff and that consent is filed with the court in 412
which the action is brought. 413
(3) A civil action regarding an alleged violation of this 414
section shall be maintained only under division (K) of this 415
section. This division does not preclude the joinder in a single 416
civil action of an action under this division and an action 417
under section 4111.10 of the Revised Code. 418
(4) Any agreement between an employee and employer to work 419
for less than the wage rate specified in Section 34a of Article 420

Constitution, there shall be no exhaustion requirement, no 424
procedural, pleading, or burden of proof requirements beyond 425

such action and no liability for costs or attorney's fees on an 427
employee except upon a finding that such action was frivolous in 428
accordance with the same standards that apply generally in civil 429
suits. Nothing in division (L) of this section affects the right 430
of an employer and employee to agree to submit a dispute under 431

this section to alternative dispute resolution, including, but 432

this section. 436
(M) An employer who provides such information specified in 437
Section 34a of Article II, Ohio Constitution, shall be immune 438

property that otherwise might be incurred or imposed as a result 440
of providing that information to an employee or person acting on 441
behalf of an employee in response to a request by the employee 442
or person, and the employer shall not be subject to the 443
provisions of Chapters 1347. and 1349. of the Revised Code to 444
the extent that such provisions would otherwise apply. As used 445
