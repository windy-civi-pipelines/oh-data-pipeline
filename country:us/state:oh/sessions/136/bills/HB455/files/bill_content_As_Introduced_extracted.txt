proprietorship, a family business, a publicly traded 1163
corporation, a group of private investors, or a bank. 1164

goods and services, and the demand for them, for consumers and 1168
producers to make informed economic decisions for themselves. 1169
(v) Wealth is created by providing goods and services that 1170
people value at a profit, and both sellers and buyers seek to 1171
profit in some way in a free market transaction. Thus, profit 1172
earned through transactions can be consumed, saved, reinvested 1173
in the business, or dispersed to shareholders. 1174
(vi) Wealth creation involves asset value appreciation and 1175
depreciation, voluntary exchange of equity ownership, and open 1176
and closed markets. 1177

first century. National studies indicate that all high school 7678
graduates need the same academic foundation, regardless of the 7679
opportunities they pursue after graduation. The goal of Ohio's 7680
system of elementary and secondary education is to prepare all 7681
students for and seamlessly connect all students to success in 7682
life beyond high school graduation, regardless of whether the 7683
next step is entering the workforce, beginning an 7684
apprenticeship, engaging in post-secondary training, serving in 7685
the military, or pursuing a college degree. 7686
The requirements for graduation prescribed in division (C) 7687
of this section are the standard expectation for all students 7688
entering ninth grade for the first time at a public or chartered 7689
nonpublic high school on or after July 1, 2010. A student may 7690

Stronger coordination between high schools and 7694
institutions of higher education is necessary to prepare 7695
students for more challenging academic endeavors and to lessen 7696
the need for academic remediation in college, thereby reducing 7697
the costs of higher education for Ohio's students, families, and 7698
the state. The department and the chancellor of higher education 7699
shall develop policies to ensure that only in rare instances 7700

on the following components: 10689
(a) Academic performance of students enrolled in community 10690

evaluation is conducted. In addition to the academic performance 10696
for a specific school year, the academic performance component 10697
shall also include year-to-year changes in the overall sponsor 10698
portfolio. For a community school for which no graded 10699
performance measures are applicable or available, the department 10700

(2) In calculating an academic performance component, the 10714
department shall exclude all community schools that have been in 10715
operation for not more than two full school years, all community 10716
schools whose contracts were not renewed or terminated by the 10717
sponsor pursuant to section 3314.07 of the Revised Code before 10718

review the evidence and information, determine whether an 10755
adjustment is valid, and promptly notify the sponsor of its 10756
determination and reasons. If any adjustments to the data could 10757

(B) The department shall explore the feasibility of using 3617
the value-added gain index and effect size to improve 3618
differentiation and interpretation of the measure. If the 3619
department determines that it is feasible, it may update the 3620
rules adopted under division (A) of this section to implement 3621
the use of gain index and effect size. If rules are adopted 3622
under division (A) of this section that use the gain index and 3623
effect size, any prior method used to calculate letter grades or 3624
performance ratings under section 3302.03 of the Revised Code 3625
shall no longer apply. Rather, the department shall update its 3626
rules to determine how letter grades or performance ratings for 3627
each level of performance are calculated under section 3302.03 3628
of the Revised Code using gain index and effect size. 3629
(C) The department shall use a system designed for 3630
collecting necessary data, calculating the value-added progress 3631
dimension, analyzing data, and generating reports, which system 3632
has been used previously by a nonprofit organization led by the 3633
Ohio business community for at least one year in the operation 3634
of a pilot program in cooperation with school districts to 3635
collect and report student achievement data via electronic means 3636
and to provide information to the districts regarding the 3637
academic performance of individual students, grade levels, 3638
school buildings, and the districts as a whole. 3639
(D) The department shall not pay more than two dollars per 3640
student for data analysis and reporting to implement the value- 3641
added progress dimension in the same manner and with the same 3642
services as under the pilot program described by division (B) of 3643
this section. However, nothing in this section shall preclude 3644
the department or any school district from entering into a 3645
contract for the provision of more services at a higher fee per 3646
student. Any data analysis conducted under this section by an 3647

and any calculation, analysis, or report utilizing aggregate 3652
student data that is generated under this section with the 3653
chancellor of higher education. The department shall not share 3654
individual student test scores and individual student reports 3655
with the chancellor. 3656
(F) The department shall make individual student 3657
performance data reports available to districts and schools that 3658
have an overall score under the value-added progress dimension 3659
calculated under division (D)(1)(d) of section 3302.03 of the 3660
Revised Code. The reports shall include data regarding student 3661
level percentiles, normal curve equivalents, unique identifiers, 3662
and other data for each school year a district or school has an 3663
overall score calculated under that division. The department 3664
also shall make available the data used to calculate the 3665
district's or school's overall growth rating. The reports shall 3666
be made available in an electronic spreadsheet form, as soon as 3667
practicable each school year, to appropriate educational 3668
personnel in each district or school for all the individual 3669
students who are administered assessments by, or who are 3670
enrolled in, the district or school. 3671

whichever is earlier. 6978
(2) Each teacher who received a rating of accomplished on 6979
the teacher's most recent evaluation conducted under this 6980

for removal of poorly performing teachers. 7013
(F) A teacher may challenge any violations of the 7014
evaluation procedures in accordance with the grievance procedure 7015
specified in any applicable collective bargaining agreement. A 7016
challenge under this division is limited to the determination of 7017
procedural errors that have resulted in substantive harm to the 7018
teacher and to ordering the correction of procedural errors. The 7019
failure of the board or a person conducting an evaluation to 7020
strictly comply with any deadline or evaluation forms 7021
established as part of the evaluation process shall not be cause 7022
for an arbitrator to determine that a procedural error occurred, 7023

bargaining agreement entered into on or after October 1, 2012. 7035

negotiate additional evaluation procedures, including an 7037

The study and instruction of financial literacy required 7663

H. B. No. 455 Page 263
As Introduced
under division (C)(9) of this section shall align with the 7664
academic content standards for financial literacy and 7665
entrepreneurship adopted under division (A)(2) of section 7666
3301.079 of the Revised Code. The instruction provided under an 7667
advanced placement course in microeconomics or macroeconomics 7668
shall be considered to be aligned with those academic content 7669
standards. In developing the curriculum for the study and 7670
instruction of financial literacy, schools may use available 7671
public-private partnerships and resources and materials that 7672
exist in business, industry, and through the centers for 7673
economics education at institutions of higher education. 7674
Ohioans must be prepared to apply increased knowledge and 7675
skills in the workplace and to adapt their knowledge and skills 7676
quickly to meet the rapidly changing conditions of the twenty- 7677
first century. National studies indicate that all high school 7678
graduates need the same academic foundation, regardless of the 7679
opportunities they pursue after graduation. The goal of Ohio's 7680
system of elementary and secondary education is to prepare all 7681
students for and seamlessly connect all students to success in 7682
life beyond high school graduation, regardless of whether the 7683
next step is entering the workforce, beginning an 7684
apprenticeship, engaging in post-secondary training, serving in 7685
the military, or pursuing a college degree. 7686
The requirements for graduation prescribed in division (C) 7687
of this section are the standard expectation for all students 7688
entering ninth grade for the first time at a public or chartered 7689
nonpublic high school on or after July 1, 2010. A student may 7690
satisfy this expectation through a variety of methods, 7691
including, but not limited to, integrated, applied, career- 7692
technical, and traditional coursework. 7693

H. B. No. 455 Page 264
As Introduced
Stronger coordination between high schools and 7694
institutions of higher education is necessary to prepare 7695
students for more challenging academic endeavors and to lessen 7696
the need for academic remediation in college, thereby reducing 7697
the costs of higher education for Ohio's students, families, and 7698
the state. The department and the chancellor of higher education 7699
shall develop policies to ensure that only in rare instances 7700
will students who complete the requirements for graduation 7701
prescribed in division (C) of this section require academic 7702
remediation after high school. 7703
School districts, community schools, and chartered 7704
nonpublic schools shall integrate technology into learning 7705
experiences across the curriculum in order to maximize 7706
efficiency, enhance learning, and prepare students for success 7707
in the technology-driven twenty-first century. Districts and 7708
schools shall use distance and web-based course delivery as a 7709
method of providing or augmenting all instruction required under 7710
this division, including laboratory experience in science. 7711
Districts and schools shall utilize technology access and 7712
electronic learning opportunities provided by the broadcast 7713
educational media commission, chancellor, the Ohio learning 7714
network, education technology centers, public television 7715
stations, and other public and private providers. 7716
(D) Except as provided in division (E) of this section, a 7717
student who enters ninth grade on or after July 1, 2010, and 7718
before July 1, 2016, may qualify for graduation from a public or 7719
chartered nonpublic high school even though the student has not 7720
completed the requirements for graduation prescribed in division 7721
(C) of this section if all of the following conditions are 7722
satisfied: 7723

through integrated instruction, the school district or school 7905
may administer the related subject area examinations upon the 7906
student's completion of the integrated course. 7907
Nothing in division (I) of this section shall be construed 7908
to excuse any school district, chartered nonpublic school, or 7909
student from any requirement in the Revised Code related to 7910
curriculum, assessments, or the awarding of a high school 7911
diploma. 7912
(J)(1) The department, in consultation with the 7913
chancellor, shall adopt a statewide plan implementing methods 7914
for students to earn units of high school credit based on a 7915
demonstration of subject area competency, instead of or in 7916
combination with completing hours of classroom instruction. The 7917
plan shall include a standard method for recording demonstrated 7918
proficiency on high school transcripts. Each school district and 7919
community school shall comply with the department's plan adopted 7920
under this division and award units of high school credit in 7921
accordance with the plan. The department may adopt existing 7922
methods for earning high school credit based on a demonstration 7923

school year. 7925
(2) The department shall update the statewide plan adopted 7926

H. B. No. 455 Page 272
As Introduced
pursuant to division (J)(1) of this section to also include 7927
methods for students enrolled in seventh and eighth grade to 7928
meet curriculum requirements based on a demonstration of subject 7929
area competency, instead of or in combination with completing 7930
hours of classroom instruction. Beginning with the 2017-2018 7931
school year, each school district and community school also 7932
shall comply with the updated plan adopted pursuant to this 7933
division and permit students enrolled in seventh and eighth 7934
grade to meet curriculum requirements based on subject area 7935
competency in accordance with the plan. 7936
(3) The department shall develop a framework for school 7937
districts and community schools to use in granting units of high 7938
school credit to students who demonstrate subject area 7939
competency through work-based learning experiences, internships, 7940
or cooperative education. Beginning with the 2018-2019 school 7941
year, each district and community school shall comply with the 7942
framework. Each district and community school also shall review 7943
any policy it has adopted regarding the demonstration of subject 7944
area competency to identify ways to incorporate work-based 7945
learning experiences, internships, and cooperative education 7946
into the policy in order to increase student engagement and 7947
opportunities to earn units of high school credit. 7948
(K) This division does not apply to students who qualify 7949
for graduation from high school under division (D) or (F) of 7950
this section, or to students pursuing a career-technical 7951
instructional track as determined by the school district board 7952
of education or the chartered nonpublic school's governing 7953

students to consider enrolling in a fine arts course as an 7955
elective. 7956

H. B. No. 455 Page 273
As Introduced
Beginning with students who enter ninth grade for the 7957
first time on or after July 1, 2010, each student enrolled in a 7958
public or chartered nonpublic high school shall complete two 7959
semesters or the equivalent of fine arts to graduate from high 7960
school. The coursework may be completed in any of grades seven 7961
to twelve. Each student who completes a fine arts course in 7962
grade seven or eight may elect to count that course toward the 7963
five units of electives required for graduation under division 7964
(C)(8) of this section, if the course satisfied the requirements 7965
of division (G) of this section. In that case, the high school 7966
shall award the student high school credit for the course and 7967
count the course toward the five units required under division 7968
(C)(8) of this section. If the course in grade seven or eight 7969
did not satisfy the requirements of division (G) of this 7970
section, the high school shall not award the student high school 7971
credit for the course but shall count the course toward the two 7972
semesters or the equivalent of fine arts required by this 7973
division. 7974
(L) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 7975
section, the board of education of each school district and the 7976
governing authority of each chartered nonpublic school may adopt 7977
a policy to excuse from the high school physical education 7978
requirement each student who, during high school, has 7979
participated in interscholastic athletics, marching band, show 7980
choir, or cheerleading for at least two full seasons or in the 7981
junior reserve officer training corps for at least two full 7982
school years. If the board or authority adopts such a policy, 7983
the board or authority shall not require the student to complete 7984
any physical education course as a condition to graduate. 7985
However, the student shall be required to complete one-half 7986
unit, consisting of at least sixty hours of instruction, in 7987

H. B. No. 455 Page 274
As Introduced
another course of study. In the case of a student who has 7988
participated in the junior reserve officer training corps for at 7989
least two full school years, credit received for that 7990
participation may be used to satisfy the requirement to complete 7991
one-half unit in another course of study. 7992
(M) It is important that high school students learn and 7993
understand United States history and the governments of both the 7994
United States and the state of Ohio. Therefore, beginning with 7995
students who enter ninth grade for the first time on or after 7996
July 1, 2012, the study of American history and American 7997
government required by divisions (B)(6) and (C)(6) of this 7998

(3) The Constitution of the United States with emphasis on 8003
the Bill of Rights; 8004
(4) The Ohio Constitution. 8005
The study of each of the documents prescribed in divisions 8006
(M)(1) to (4) of this section shall include study of that 8007
document in its original context. 8008
The study of American history and government required by 8009
divisions (B)(6) and (C)(6) of this section shall include the 8010
historical evidence of the role of documents such as the 8011
Federalist Papers and the Anti-Federalist Papers to firmly 8012
establish the historical background leading to the establishment 8013
of the provisions of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. 8014

computer science to satisfy one unit of mathematics or one unit 8016
of science under division (C) of this section as the student 8017
chooses, regardless of the field of certification of the teacher 8018
who teaches the course, so long as that teacher meets the 8019
licensure requirements prescribed by section 3319.236 of the 8020
Revised Code and, prior to teaching the course, completes a 8021
professional development program determined to be appropriate by 8022
the district board. 8023
If a student applies more than one computer science course 8024
to satisfy curriculum requirements under that division, the 8025
courses shall be sequential and progressively more difficult or 8026
cover different subject areas within computer science. 8027
(O) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 8028
section, the board of education of each school district and the 8029
governing authority of each chartered nonpublic school may adopt 8030
a policy to excuse from the financial literacy instruction 8031
requirement under division (C)(9) of this section each student 8032
who, during high school, participates in a financial literacy 8033
program offered through a student branch, as defined in section 8034
1733.04 of the Revised Code, or by a bank, as defined in section 8035
1101.01 of the Revised Code. The policy shall require the 8036
financial literacy program to meet or exceed the academic 8037
content standards and model curriculum for financial literacy 8038
and entrepreneurship instruction adopted under section 3301.079 8039
of the Revised Code. The policy shall require a student to 8040
participate in the program for the equivalent of at least one- 8041
half unit of instruction to qualify for an exemption under this 8042
division. 8043
Not later than July 1, 2026, the department shall develop 8044
and post on its web site a model policy and guidelines for 8045

services. The department shall certify the total educational 9404
cost to be paid for the child to both the home or facility 9405
providing the educational services and the district that is 9406
responsible to pay the tuition for the child. The department 9407
shall deduct the certified amount from the state basic aid funds 9408

Sec. 3314.016. This section applies to any entity that 10650
sponsors a community school, regardless of whether section 10651
3314.021 or 3314.027 of the Revised Code exempts the entity from 10652
the requirement to be approved for sponsorship under divisions 10653
(A)(2) and (B)(1) of section 3314.015 of the Revised Code. The 10654
office of Ohio school sponsorship established under section 10655
3314.029 of the Revised Code shall be rated under division (B) 10656
of this section, but divisions (A) and (C) of this section do 10657

evaluation system that annually rates and assigns an overall 10674
rating to each entity that sponsors a community school. The 10675
department, not later than the first day of February of each 10676
year, shall post on the department's web site the framework for 10677
the evaluation system, including technical documentation that 10678
the department intends to use to rate sponsors for the next 10679
school year. The department shall solicit public comment on the 10680
evaluation system for thirty consecutive days. Not later than 10681
the first day of April of each year, the department shall 10682
compile and post on the department's web site all public 10683
comments that were received during the public comment period. 10684

site by the fifteenth day of July of each school year. Any 10686
changes to the evaluation system after that date shall take 10687
effect the following year. The evaluation system shall be based 10688
on the following components: 10689
(a) Academic performance of students enrolled in community 10690
schools sponsored by the same entity. The academic performance 10691
component shall be derived from the performance measures 10692
prescribed for the state report cards under section 3302.03 or 10693
3314.017 of the Revised Code, and shall be based on the 10694
performance of the schools for the school year for which the 10695
evaluation is conducted. In addition to the academic performance 10696
for a specific school year, the academic performance component 10697
shall also include year-to-year changes in the overall sponsor 10698
portfolio. For a community school for which no graded 10699
performance measures are applicable or available, the department 10700
shall use nonreport card performance measures specified in the 10701
contract between the community school and the sponsor under 10702
division (A)(4) of section 3314.03 of the Revised Code. 10703
(b) Adherence by a sponsor to the quality practices 10704

prescribed by the department under division (B)(3) of this 10705
section. 10706
(c) Compliance with all applicable laws and administrative 10707
rules by an entity that sponsors a community school. 10708
Under the evaluation system prescribed under division (B) 10709
(1) of this section, the department shall not assign an overall 10710
rating of "ineffective" or lower to an entity that sponsors a 10711
community school solely because that entity received no points 10712
on one of the components prescribed under that division. 10713
(2) In calculating an academic performance component, the 10714
department shall exclude all community schools that have been in 10715
operation for not more than two full school years, all community 10716
schools whose contracts were not renewed or terminated by the 10717
sponsor pursuant to section 3314.07 of the Revised Code before 10718
the evaluation, and all community schools described in division 10719
(B)(2) of section 3314.35 of the Revised Code. However, the 10720
academic performance of the community schools described in 10721
division (B)(2) of section 3314.35 of the Revised Code shall be 10722
reported, but shall not be used as a factor when determining a 10723
sponsoring entity's rating under this section. 10724
(3) The department, in consultation with entities that 10725
sponsor community schools, shall prescribe quality practices for 10726
community school sponsors and develop an instrument to measure 10727
adherence to those quality practices. The quality practices 10728
shall be based on standards developed by the national 10729
association of charter school authorizers or any other 10730
nationally organized community school organization. 10731
(4) The director of education and workforce shall adopt 10732
rules in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code 10733

prescribing standards for measuring compliance with applicable 10734
laws and rules under division (B)(1)(c) of this section. 10735
(5) The department annually shall rate all entities that 10736
sponsor community schools as either "exemplary," "effective," 10737
"ineffective," or "poor," based on the components prescribed by 10738
division (B) of this section, where each component is weighted 10739
equally. A separate rating shall be given by the department for 10740
each component of the evaluation system. 10741
The department shall publish the ratings between the first 10742
day of October and the fifteenth day of November. 10743
Prior to the publication of the final ratings, the 10744
department shall designate and provide notice of a period of at 10745
least ten business days during which each sponsor may review the 10746
information used by the department to determine the sponsor's 10747
rating on the components prescribed by division (B)(1) of this 10748
section. If the sponsor believes there is an error in the 10749
department's evaluation, the sponsor may request adjustments to 10750
the rating of any of those components based on documentation 10751
previously submitted as part of an evaluation. The sponsor shall 10752
provide to the department any necessary evidence or information 10753
to support the requested adjustments. The department shall 10754
review the evidence and information, determine whether an 10755
adjustment is valid, and promptly notify the sponsor of its 10756
determination and reasons. If any adjustments to the data could 10757
result in a change to the rating on the applicable component or 10758
to the overall rating, the department shall recalculate the 10759
ratings prior to publication. 10760
The department shall provide training on an annual basis 10761
regarding the evaluation system prescribed under this section. 10762
The training shall, at a minimum, describe methodology, 10763

entity that sponsors a community school by the fifteenth day of 10767
July of each year and shall include guidance on any changes made 10768
to the evaluation system. 10769

take advantage of the following incentives: 10771
(i) Renewal of the written agreement with the department, 10772

described in division (B)(1)(b) of this section; 10775
(ii) The ability to extend the term of the contract 10776

contract adoption and execution deadline requirements prescribed 10780
in division (D) of section 3314.02 of the Revised Code; 10781

thirtieth day of September of the calendar year in which the 10784
community school contract is executed; 10785
(v) No limit on the number of community schools the entity 10786

overall rating. 10793
(b) Entities with an overall rating of "exemplary" shall 10794
not be evaluated by the department for five full school years 10795
following the school year for which the entity received the 10796
"exemplary" rating. Entities with an overall rating of 10797
"effective" shall not be evaluated by the department for three 10798
full school years following the school year for which the entity 10799
received the "effective" rating. 10800
(c)(i) Entities that receive an overall rating of 10801
"ineffective" shall be prohibited from sponsoring any new or 10802
additional community schools during the time in which the 10803

that led to the "ineffective" rating, with timelines and 10806
benchmarks that have been established by the department. 10807
(ii) Entities that receive an overall rating of 10808

enters into a contract with a sponsor prior to the date on which 10843
the sponsor is prohibited from sponsoring additional schools 10844
under division (A) of this section and the school has not opened 10845
for operation as of that date, that contract shall be void and 10846
the school shall not open until the governing authority secures 10847
