individual's previous vocation, employment, or affiliations, cannot be classed as either
predominantly representative of employees or of employers. The governor shall select the
chairperson of the board who shall serve as chairperson at the pleasure of the governor.
None of the members of the board, within one year immediately preceding the member's

appointment, shall have been employed by the bureau of workers' compensation or by any person,
partnership, or corporation that has provided to the bureau services of a financial or investment
nature, including the management, analysis, supervision, or investment of assets.
(B) Of the initial appointments made to the board, the governor shall appoint the member
who represents employees, one member who represents employers, and the member who represents
the public to a term ending one year after June 11, 2007; one member who represents employers,
one member who represents employee organizations, one member who is an investment and
securities expert, and the member who is a certified public accountant to a term ending two years

who is an actuary to a term ending three years after June 11, 2007. Thereafter, terms of office shall
be for three years, with each term ending on the same day of the same month as did the term that it
succeeds. Each member shall hold office from the date of the member's appointment until the end of
the term for which the member was appointed.
Members may be reappointed. Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the
expiration date of the term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office as a

within thirty days after other vacancies occurring on the board, the nominating committee shall
submit an initial list containing four names for each vacancy. Within fourteen days after the
submission of the initial list, the governor either shall appoint individuals from that list or request the
nominating committee to submit another list of four names for each member the governor has not
appointed from the initial list, which list the nominating committee shall submit to the governor
within fourteen days after the governor's request. The governor then shall appoint, within seven days
after the submission of the second list, one of the individuals from either list to fill the vacancy for
which the governor has not made an appointment from the initial list. If the governor appoints an
individual to fill a vacancy occurring as a result of the expiration of a term, the individual appointed
shall begin serving as a member of the board when the term for which the individual's predecessor
was appointed expires or immediately upon appointment by the governor, whichever occurs later.
With respect to the filling of vacancies, the nominating committee shall provide the governor with a
list of four individuals who are, in the judgment of the nominating committee, the most fully

placed in the unclassified service or is otherwise unavailable, the person shall be appointed to a
position in the classified service within the bureau that the director of administrative services
certifies is comparable in compensation to the position the person previously held in the classified
service. Service in the position in the unclassified service shall be counted as service in the position
in the classified service held by the person immediately prior to the person's appointment in the
unclassified service. When a person is reinstated to a position in the classified service as provided in
this division, the person is entitled to all rights, status, and benefits accruing to the position during
the person's time of service in the position in the unclassified service.
(3) Reorganize the work of the bureau, its sections, departments, and offices to the extent
necessary to achieve the most efficient performance of its functions and to that end may establish,
change, or abolish positions and assign and reassign duties and responsibilities of every employee of
the bureau. All persons employed by the commission in positions that, after November 3, 1989, are
supervised and directed by the administrator under this section are transferred to the bureau in their
respective classifications but subject to reassignment and reclassification of position and
compensation as the administrator determines to be in the interest of efficient administration. The
civil service status of any person employed by the commission is not affected by this section.
Personnel employed by the bureau or the commission who are subject to Chapter 4117. of the
Revised Code shall retain all of their rights and benefits conferred pursuant to that chapter as it
presently exists or is hereafter amended and nothing in this chapter or Chapter 4123. of the Revised
Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
9

purchase, repair, or replacement is necessary due to an amputation or loss that resulted from an
allowed injury or occupational disease.
(3) Ordering a payment under division (B)(2) of this section does not extend the time period
during which the commission or administrator may modify or change a former finding or order in a
claim as provided under division (A) of this section.
(C) Notwithstanding division (A) of this section, and except as otherwise provided in a rule
that shall be adopted by the administrator, with the advice and consent of the bureau of workers'
compensation board of directors, neither the administrator nor the commission shall make any
finding or award for payment of medical or vocational rehabilitation services submitted for payment
more than one year after the date the services were rendered or more than one year after the date the
services became payable under division (I) of section 4123.511 of the Revised Code, whichever is
later. No medical or vocational rehabilitation provider shall bill a claimant for services rendered if
the administrator or commission is prohibited from making that payment under this division.

medicare and medicaid services in the United States department of health and human services for
reimbursement of conditional payments made pursuant to section 1395y(b)(2) of title 42, United
States Code (commonly known as the "Medicare Secondary Payer Act").

subsequent to the filing of any such application, provided the application is filed within the time
limit provided in this section.
(E)(F) This section does not deprive the commission of its continuing jurisdiction to
determine the questions raised by any application for modification of award which has been filed
with the commission after June 1, 1932, and prior to the expiration of the applicable period but in
respect to which no award has been granted or denied during the applicable period.

Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
16
films, or other direct or electronic document retention media, when properly identified, have the
same effect as the original record and may be offered in like manner and may be received as
evidence in proceedings before the industrial commission, staff hearing officers, and district hearing
officers, and in any court where the original record could have been introduced.
Sec. 4123.54. (A) Except as otherwise provided in this division or divisions (I) and (K) of
this section, every employee, who is injured or who contracts an occupational disease, and the
dependents of each employee who is killed, or dies as the result of an occupational disease
contracted in the course of employment, wherever the injury has occurred or occupational disease
has been contracted, is entitled to receive the compensation for loss sustained on account of the
injury, occupational disease, or death, and the medical, nurse, and hospital services and medicines,
and the amount of funeral expenses in case of death, as are provided by this chapter. The
compensation and benefits shall be provided, as applicable, directly from the employee's self-
insuring employer as provided in section 4123.35 of the Revised Code or from the state insurance
fund. An employee or dependent is not entitled to receive compensation or benefits under this
division if the employee's injury or occupational disease is either of the following:
(1) Purposely self-inflicted;
(2) Caused by the employee being intoxicated, under the influence of a controlled substance
not prescribed by a physician, certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse
practitioner, or under the influence of marihuana if being intoxicated, under the influence of a
controlled substance not prescribed by a physician, certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse specialist,
or certified nurse practitioner, or under the influence of marihuana was the proximate cause of the
injury.
(B) For the purpose of this section, provided that an employer has posted written notice to
employees that the results of, or the employee's refusal to submit to, any chemical test described
under this division may affect the employee's eligibility for compensation and benefits pursuant to
this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code, there is a rebuttable presumption that an
employee is intoxicated, under the influence of a controlled substance not prescribed by the
employee's physician, certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse
practitioner, or under the influence of marihuana and that being intoxicated, under the influence of a
controlled substance not prescribed by the employee's physician, certified nurse-midwife, clinical
nurse specialist, or certified nurse practitioner, or under the influence of marihuana is the proximate
cause of an injury under either of the following conditions:
(1) When any one or more of the following is true:
(a) The employee, through a qualifying chemical test administered within eight hours of an
injury, is determined to have an alcohol concentration level equal to or in excess of the levels
established in divisions (A)(1)(b) to (i) of section 4511.19 of the Revised Code.
(b) The employee, through a qualifying chemical test administered within thirty-two hours of
an injury, is determined to have a controlled substance not prescribed by the employee's physician,
Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
17
certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse practitioner or marihuana in the
employee's system at a level equal to or in excess of the cutoff concentration level for the particular
substance as provided in section 40.87 40.85 of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 49
C.F.R. 40.8740.85, as amendedit existed on January 1, 2024, or as subsequently amended as a result
of a statute or rule.
(c) The employee, through a qualifying chemical test administered within thirty-two hours of
an injury, is determined to have barbiturates, benzodiazepines, or methadone in the employee's
system that tests above levels established by laboratories certified by the United States department of
health and human services.
(2) When the employee refuses to submit to a requested chemical test, on the condition that
that employee is or was given notice that the refusal to submit to any chemical test described in
division (B)(1) of this section may affect the employee's eligibility for compensation and benefits
under this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code.
(C)(1) For purposes of division (B) of this section, a chemical test is a qualifying chemical
test if it is administered to an employee after an injury under at least one of the following conditions:
(a) When the employee's employer had reasonable cause to suspect that the employee may
be intoxicated, under the influence of a controlled substance not prescribed by the employee's
physician, certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse practitioner, or under
the influence of marihuana;
(b) At the request of a police officer pursuant to section 4511.191 of the Revised Code, and
not at the request of the employee's employer;
(c) At the request of a licensed physician, certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse specialist,
or certified nurse practitioner who is not employed by the employee's employer, and not at the
request of the employee's employer.
(2) As used in division (C)(1)(a) of this section, "reasonable cause" means, but is not limited
to, evidence that an employee is or was using alcohol, a controlled substance, or marihuana drawn
from specific, objective facts and reasonable inferences drawn from these facts in light of experience
and training. These facts and inferences may be based on, but are not limited to, any of the
following:
(a) Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of use, possession, or distribution of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or marihuana, or of the physical symptoms of being under the
influence of alcohol, a controlled substance, or marihuana, such as but not limited to slurred speech;
dilated pupils; odor of alcohol, a controlled substance, or marihuana; changes in affect; or dynamic
mood swings;
(b) A pattern of abnormal conduct, erratic or aberrant behavior, or deteriorating work
performance such as frequent absenteeism, excessive tardiness, or recurrent accidents, that appears
to be related to the use of alcohol, a controlled substance, or marihuana, and does not appear to be
attributable to other factors;
Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
18
(c) The identification of an employee as the focus of a criminal investigation into
unauthorized possession, use, or trafficking of a controlled substance or marihuana;
(d) A report of use of alcohol, a controlled substance, or marihuana provided by a reliable
and credible source;

that are determined by the employee's supervisor to pose a substantial risk of physical injury or
property damage and that appear to be related to the use of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
marihuana and that do not appear attributable to other factors.
(D) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the rights of an employer to test
employees for alcohol or controlled substance abuse.
(E) For the purpose of this section, laboratories certified by the United States department of
health and human services or laboratories that meet or exceed the standards of that department for
laboratory certification shall be used for processing the test results of a qualifying chemical test.
(F) The written notice required by division (B) of this section shall be the same size or larger
than the proof of workers' compensation coverage furnished by the bureau of workers' compensation
and shall be posted by the employer in the same location as the proof of workers' compensation
coverage or the certificate of self-insurance.
(G) If a condition that pre-existed an injury is substantially aggravated by the injury, and that
substantial aggravation is documented by objective diagnostic findings, objective clinical findings,
or objective test results, no compensation or benefits are payable because of the pre-existing
condition once that condition has returned to a level that would have existed without the injury.
(H)(1) Whenever, with respect to an employee of an employer who is subject to and has
complied with this chapter, there is possibility of conflict with respect to the application of workers'
compensation laws because the contract of employment is entered into and all or some portion of the
work is or is to be performed in a state or states other than Ohio, the employer and the employee
may agree to be bound by the laws of this state or by the laws of some other state in which all or
some portion of the work of the employee is to be performed. The agreement shall be in writing and
shall be filed with the bureau of workers' compensation within ten days after it is executed and shall
remain in force until terminated or modified by agreement of the parties similarly filed. If the
agreement is to be bound by the laws of this state and the employer has complied with this chapter,
then the employee is entitled to compensation and benefits regardless of where the injury occurs or
the disease is contracted and the rights of the employee and the employee's dependents under the
laws of this state are the exclusive remedy against the employer on account of injury, disease, or
death in the course of and arising out of the employee's employment. If the agreement is to be bound
by the laws of another state and the employer has complied with the laws of that state, the rights of
the employee and the employee's dependents under the laws of that state are the exclusive remedy
against the employer on account of injury, disease, or death in the course of and arising out of the
employee's employment without regard to the place where the injury was sustained or the disease
Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
19
contracted. If an employer and an employee enter into an agreement under this division, the fact that
the employer and the employee entered into that agreement shall not be construed to change the
status of an employee whose continued employment is subject to the will of the employer or the
employee, unless the agreement contains a provision that expressly changes that status.
(2) If an employee or the employee's dependents receive an award of compensation or
benefits under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for the same
injury, occupational disease, or death for which the employee or the employee's dependents
previously pursued or otherwise elected to accept workers' compensation benefits and received a
decision on the merits as defined in section 4123.542 of the Revised Code under the laws of another
state or recovered damages under the laws of another state, the claim shall be disallowed and the
administrator or any self-insuring employer, by any lawful means, may collect from the employee or
the employee's dependents any of the following:
(a) The amount of compensation or benefits paid to or on behalf of the employee or the
employee's dependents by the administrator or a self-insuring employer pursuant to this chapter or
Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for that award;
(b) Any interest, attorney's fees, and costs the administrator or the self-insuring employer
incurs in collecting that payment.
(3) If an employee or the employee's dependents receive an award of compensation or
benefits under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code and subsequently
pursue or otherwise elect to accept workers' compensation benefits or damages under the laws of
another state for the same injury, occupational disease, or death the claim under this chapter or
Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code shall be disallowed. The administrator or a self-
insuring employer, by any lawful means, may collect from the employee or the employee's
dependents or other-states' insurer any of the following:
(a) The amount of compensation or benefits paid to or on behalf of the employee or the
employee's dependents by the administrator or the self-insuring employer pursuant to this chapter or
Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for that award;
(b) Any interest, costs, and attorney's fees the administrator or the self-insuring employer
incurs in collecting that payment;
(c) Any costs incurred by an employer in contesting or responding to any claim filed by the
employee or the employee's dependents for the same injury, occupational disease, or death that was
filed after the original claim for which the employee or the employee's dependents received a
decision on the merits as described in section 4123.542 of the Revised Code.
(4) If the employee's employer pays premiums into the state insurance fund, the
administrator shall not charge the amount of compensation or benefits the administrator collects
pursuant to division (H)(2) or (3) of this section to the employer's experience. If the administrator
collects any costs incurred by an employer in contesting or responding to any claim pursuant to
division (H)(2) or (3) of this section, the administrator shall forward the amount collected to that
Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
20
employer. If the employee's employer is a self-insuring employer, the self-insuring employer shall
deduct the amount of compensation or benefits the self-insuring employer collects pursuant to this
division from the paid compensation the self-insuring employer reports to the administrator under
division (L) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code.
(5) If an employee is a resident of a state other than this state and is insured under the
workers' compensation law or similar laws of a state other than this state, the employee and the
employee's dependents are not entitled to receive compensation or benefits under this chapter, on
account of injury, disease, or death arising out of or in the course of employment while temporarily
within this state, and the rights of the employee and the employee's dependents under the laws of the
other state are the exclusive remedy against the employer on account of the injury, disease, or death.
(6) An employee, or the dependent of an employee, who elects to receive compensation and
benefits under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for a claim may
not receive compensation and benefits under the workers' compensation laws of any state other than
this state for that same claim. For each claim submitted by or on behalf of an employee, the
administrator or, if the employee is employed by a self-insuring employer, the self-insuring
employer, shall request the employee or the employee's dependent to sign an election that affirms
the employee's or employee's dependent's acceptance of electing to receive compensation and
benefits under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for that claim that
also affirmatively waives and releases the employee's or the employee's dependent's right to file for
and receive compensation and benefits under the laws of any state other than this state for that claim.
The employee or employee's dependent shall sign the election form within twenty-eight days after
the administrator or self-insuring employer submits the request or the administrator or self-insuring
employer shall dismiss that claim.
In the event a workers' compensation claim has been filed in another jurisdiction on behalf of
an employee or the dependents of an employee, and the employee or dependents subsequently elect
to receive compensation, benefits, or both under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the
Revised Code, the employee or dependent shall withdraw or refuse acceptance of the workers'
compensation claim filed in the other jurisdiction in order to pursue compensation or benefits under
the laws of this state. If the employee or dependents were awarded workers' compensation benefits
or had recovered damages under the laws of the other state, any compensation and benefits awarded
under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code shall be paid only to the
extent to which those payments exceed the amounts paid under the laws of the other state. If the
employee or dependent fails to withdraw or to refuse acceptance of the workers' compensation claim
in the other jurisdiction within twenty-eight days after a request made by the administrator or a self-
insuring employer, the administrator or self-insuring employer shall dismiss the employee's or
employee's dependents' claim made in this state.
(I) If an employee who is covered under the federal "Longshore and Harbor Workers'
Compensation Act," 98 Stat. 1639, 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq., is injured or contracts an occupational
Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
21
disease or dies as a result of an injury or occupational disease, and if that employee's or that
employee's dependents' claim for compensation or benefits for that injury, occupational disease, or
death is subject to the jurisdiction of that act, the employee or the employee's dependents are not
entitled to apply for and shall not receive compensation or benefits under this chapter and Chapter

Section 18:
4121. of the Revised Code. The rights of such an employee and the employee's dependents under the
federal "Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act," 98 Stat. 1639, 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq.,
are the exclusive remedy against the employer for that injury, occupational disease, or death.
(J) Compensation or benefits are not payable to a claimant or a dependent during the period
of confinement of the claimant or dependent in any state or federal correctional institution, or in any
county jail in lieu of incarceration in a state or federal correctional institution, whether in this or any
other state for conviction of violation of any state or federal criminal law.
(K) An employer, upon the approval of the administrator, may provide for workers'
compensation coverage for the employer's employees who are professional athletes and coaches by
submitting to the administrator proof of coverage under a league policy issued under the laws of
another state under either of the following circumstances:
(1) The employer administers the payroll and workers' compensation insurance for a
professional sports team subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and the collective bargaining
agreement provides for the uniform administration of workers' compensation benefits and
compensation for professional athletes.
(2) The employer is a professional sports league, or is a member team of a professional
sports league, and all of the following apply:
(a) The professional sports league operates as a single entity, whereby all of the players and
coaches of the sports league are employees of the sports league and not of the individual member
teams.
(b) The professional sports league at all times maintains workers' compensation insurance
that provides coverage for the players and coaches of the sports league.
(c) Each individual member team of the professional sports league, pursuant to the
organizational or operating documents of the sports league, is obligated to the sports league to pay to
the sports league any workers' compensation claims that are not covered by the workers'
compensation insurance maintained by the sports league.
If the administrator approves the employer's proof of coverage submitted under division (K)
of this section, a professional athlete or coach who is an employee of the employer and the
dependents of the professional athlete or coach are not entitled to apply for and shall not receive
compensation or benefits under this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code. The rights of
such an athlete or coach and the dependents of such an athlete or coach under the laws of the state
where the policy was issued are the exclusive remedy against the employer for the athlete or coach if
the athlete or coach suffers an injury or contracts an occupational disease in the course of
employment, or for the dependents of the athlete or the coach if the athlete or coach is killed as a
Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
22
result of an injury or dies as a result of an occupational disease, regardless of the location where the
injury was suffered or the occupational disease was contracted.
Sec. 4123.57. Partial disability compensation shall be paid as follows.
Except as provided in this section, not earlier than twenty-six weeks after the date of
termination of the latest period of payments under section 4123.56 of the Revised Code or twenty-
six weeks after the termination of wages in lieu of those payments, or not earlier than twenty-six
weeks after the date of the injury or contraction of an occupational disease in the absence of
payments under section 4123.56 of the Revised Code or wages in lieu of those payments, the
employee may file an application with the bureau of workers' compensation for the determination of
the percentage of the employee's permanent partial disability resulting from an injury or
occupational disease.
Whenever the application is filed, the bureau shall send a copy of the application to the
employee's employer or the employer's representative and shall schedule the employee for a medical
examination by the bureau medical section. The bureau shall send a copy of the report of the medical
examination to the employee, the employer, and their representatives. Thereafter, the administrator
of workers' compensation shall review the employee's claim file and make a tentative order as the
evidence before the administrator at the time of the making of the order warrants. If the
administrator determines that there is a conflict of evidence, the administrator shall send the
application, along with the claimant's file, to the district hearing officer who shall set the application
for a hearing.
If an employee fails to respond to an attempt to schedule a medical examination by the
bureau medical section, or fails to attend a medical examination scheduled under this section without
notice or explanation, the employee's application for a finding shall be dismissed without prejudice.
The employee may refile the application. A dismissed application does not toll the continuing
jurisdiction of the industrial commission under section 4123.52 of the Revised Code. The
administrator shall adopt rules addressing the manner in which an employee will be notified of a
possible dismissal and how an employee may refile an application for a determination.
The administrator shall notify the employee, the employer, and their representatives, in
writing, of the tentative order and of the parties' right to request a hearing. Unless the employee, the
employer, or their representative notifies the administrator, in writing, of an objection to the
tentative order within twenty days after receipt of the notice thereof, the tentative order shall go into
effect and the employee shall receive the compensation provided in the order. In no event shall there
be a reconsideration of a tentative order issued under this division.
If the employee, the employer, or their representatives timely notify the administrator of an
objection to the tentative order, the matter shall be referred to a district hearing officer who shall set
the application for hearing with written notices to all interested persons. Upon referral to a district
hearing officer, the employer may obtain a medical examination of the employee, pursuant to rules
of the industrial commission.
Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.

(A) The district hearing officer, upon the application, shall determine the percentage of the
employee's permanent disability, except as is subject to division (B) of this section, based upon that
condition of the employee resulting from the injury or occupational disease and causing permanent
impairment evidenced by medical or clinical findings reasonably demonstrable. The employee shall
receive sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the employee's average weekly wage, but not more than
a maximum of thirty-three and one-third per cent of the statewide average weekly wage as defined in
division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code, per week regardless of the average weekly
wage, for the number of weeks which equals the percentage of two hundred weeks. Except on
application for reconsideration, review, or modification, which is filed within ten days after the date
of receipt of the decision of the district hearing officer, in no instance shall the former award be
modified unless it is found from medical or clinical findings that the condition of the claimant
resulting from the injury has so progressed as to have increased the percentage of permanent partial
disability. A staff hearing officer shall hear an application for reconsideration filed and the staff
hearing officer's decision is final. An employee may file an application for a subsequent
determination of the percentage of the employee's permanent disability. If such an application is
filed, the bureau shall send a copy of the application to the employer or the employer's
representative. No sooner than sixty days from the date of the mailing of the application to the
employer or the employer's representative, the administrator shall review the application. The
administrator may require a medical examination or medical review of the employee. The
administrator shall issue a tentative order based upon the evidence before the administrator, provided
that if the administrator requires a medical examination or medical review, the administrator shall
not issue the tentative order until the completion of the examination or review.
The employer may obtain a medical examination of the employee and may submit medical
evidence at any stage of the process up to a hearing before the district hearing officer, pursuant to
rules of the commission. The administrator shall notify the employee, the employer, and their
representatives, in writing, of the nature and amount of any tentative order issued on an application
requesting a subsequent determination of the percentage of an employee's permanent disability. An
employee, employer, or their representatives may object to the tentative order within twenty days
after the receipt of the notice thereof. If no timely objection is made, the tentative order shall go into
effect. In no event shall there be a reconsideration of a tentative order issued under this division. If
an objection is timely made, the application for a subsequent determination shall be referred to a
district hearing officer who shall set the application for a hearing with written notice to all interested
persons. No application for subsequent percentage determinations on the same claim for injury or
occupational disease shall be accepted for review by the district hearing officer unless supported by
substantial evidence of new and changed circumstances developing since the time of the hearing on
the original or last determination.
No award shall be made under this division based upon a percentage of disability which,
when taken with all other percentages of permanent disability, exceeds one hundred per cent. If the
Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
24
percentage of the permanent disability of the employee equals or exceeds ninety per cent,
compensation for permanent partial disability shall be paid for two hundred weeks.
Compensation payable under this division accrues and is payable to the employee from the
date of last payment of compensation, or, in cases where no previous compensation has been paid,
from the date of the injury or the date of the diagnosis of the occupational disease.
When an award under this division has been made prior to the death of an employee, all
unpaid installments accrued or to accrue under the provisions of the award are payable to the
surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse, to the dependent children of the employee, and
if there are no children surviving, then to other dependents as the administrator determines.
(B) For purposes of this division, "payable per week" means the seven-consecutive-day
period in which compensation is paid in installments according to the schedule associated with the
applicable injury as set forth in this division.
Compensation paid in weekly installments according to the schedule described in this
division may only be commuted to one or more lump sum payments pursuant to the procedure set
forth in section 4123.64 of the Revised Code.
In cases included in the following schedule the compensation payable per week to the
employee is the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the
Revised Code per week and shall be paid in installments according to the following schedule:
For the loss of a first finger, commonly known as a thumb, sixty weeks.
For the loss of a second finger, commonly called index finger, thirty-five weeks.
For the loss of a third finger, thirty weeks.
For the loss of a fourth finger, twenty weeks.
For the loss of a fifth finger, commonly known as the little finger, fifteen weeks.
The loss of a second, or distal, phalange of the thumb is considered equal to the loss of one
half of such thumb; the loss of more than one half of such thumb is considered equal to the loss of
the whole thumb.
The loss of the third, or distal, phalange of any finger is considered equal to the loss of one-
third of the finger.
The loss of the middle, or second, phalange of any finger is considered equal to the loss of
two-thirds of the finger.
The loss of more than the middle and distal phalanges of any finger is considered equal to
the loss of the whole finger. In no case shall the amount received for more than one finger exceed
the amount provided in this schedule for the loss of a hand.
For the loss of the metacarpal bone (bones of the palm) for the corresponding thumb, or
fingers, add ten weeks to the number of weeks under this division.
For ankylosis (total stiffness of) or contractures (due to scars or injuries) which makes any of
the fingers, thumbs, or parts of either useless, the same number of weeks apply to the members or
parts thereof as given for the loss thereof.
Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
25
If the claimant has suffered the loss of two or more fingers by amputation or ankylosis and
the nature of the claimant's employment in the course of which the claimant was working at the time
of the injury or occupational disease is such that the impairment or disability resulting from the loss
of fingers, or loss of use of fingers, exceeds the normal impairment or disability resulting from the
loss of fingers, or loss of use of fingers, the administrator may take that fact into consideration and
increase the award of compensation accordingly, but the award made shall not exceed the amount of
compensation for loss of a hand.
For the loss of a hand, one hundred seventy-five weeks.
For the loss of an arm, two hundred twenty-five weeks.
For the loss of a great toe, thirty weeks.
For the loss of one of the toes other than the great toe, ten weeks.
The loss of more than two-thirds of any toe is considered equal to the loss of the whole toe.
The loss of less than two-thirds of any toe is considered no loss, except as to the great toe;
the loss of the great toe up to the interphalangeal joint is co-equal to the loss of one-half of the great
toe; the loss of the great toe beyond the interphalangeal joint is considered equal to the loss of the
whole great toe.
For the loss of a foot, one hundred fifty weeks.
For the loss of a leg, two hundred weeks.
For the loss of the sight of an eye, one hundred twenty-five weeks.
For the permanent partial loss of sight of an eye, the portion of one hundred twenty-five
weeks as the administrator in each case determines, based upon the percentage of vision actually lost
as a result of the injury or occupational disease, but, in no case shall an award of compensation be
made for less than twenty-five per cent loss of uncorrected vision. "Loss of uncorrected vision"
means the percentage of vision actually lost as the result of the injury or occupational disease.
For the permanent and total loss of hearing of one ear, twenty-five weeks; but in no case
shall an award of compensation be made for less than permanent and total loss of hearing of one ear.
For the permanent and total loss of hearing, one hundred twenty-five weeks; but, except
pursuant to the next preceding paragraph, in no case shall an award of compensation be made for
less than permanent and total loss of hearing.
In case an injury or occupational disease results in serious facial or head disfigurement
which either impairs or may in the future impair the opportunities to secure or retain employment,
the administrator shall make an award of compensation as it deems proper and equitable, in view of
the nature of the disfigurement, and not to exceed the sum of ten thousand dollars. For the purpose
of making the award, it is not material whether the employee is gainfully employed in any
occupation or trade at the time of the administrator's determination.
When an award under this division has been made prior to the death of an employee all
unpaid installments accrued or to accrue under the provisions of the award shall be payable to the
surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse, to the dependent children of the employee and if
Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
26
there are no such children, then to such dependents as the administrator determines.
When an employee has sustained the loss of a member by severance, but no award has been
made on account thereof prior to the employee's death, the administrator shall make an award in
accordance with this division for the loss which shall be payable to the surviving spouse, or if there
is no surviving spouse, to the dependent children of the employee and if there are no such children,
then to such dependents as the administrator determines.
(C) Compensation for partial impairment under divisions (A) and (B) of this section is in
addition to the compensation paid the employee pursuant to section 4123.56 of the Revised Code. A
claimant may receive compensation under divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
In all cases arising under division (B) of this section, if it is determined by any one of the
following: (1) the amputee clinic at University hospital, Ohio state university; (2) the opportunities
for Ohioans with disabilities agency; (3) an amputee clinic or prescribing physician approved by the
administrator or the administrator's designee, that an injured or disabled employee is in need of an
artificial appliance, or in need of a repair thereof, regardless of whether the appliance or its repair
will be serviceable in the vocational rehabilitation of the injured employee, and regardless of
whether the employee has returned to or can ever again return to any gainful employment, the
bureau shall pay the cost of the artificial appliance or its repair out of the surplus created by division
(B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code.
Notwithstanding any provision in this division to the contrary, when a claimant has sustained
an amputation or a loss enumerated in division (B) of this section as a result of an injury or
occupational disease, the administrator shall pay the cost to purchase, repair, or replace a prosthetic
device as defined in division (B) of section 4123.52 from the surplus fund account created pursuant
to division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code, even if no award has been made under
division (B) of this section.
In those cases where an opportunities for Ohioans with disabilities agency's recommendation
that an injured or disabled employee is in need of an artificial appliance would conflict with their
state plan, adopted pursuant to the "Rehabilitation Act of 1973," 87 Stat. 355, 29 U.S.C.A. 701, the
administrator or the administrator's designee or the bureau may obtain a recommendation from an
amputee clinic or prescribing physician that they determine appropriate.
(D) If an employee of a state fund employer makes application for a finding and the
administrator finds that the employee has contracted silicosis as defined in division (Y), or coal
miners' pneumoconiosis as defined in division (Z), or asbestosis as defined in division (BB) of

Section 19:
section 4123.68 of the Revised Code, and that a change of such employee's occupation is medically
advisable in order to decrease substantially further exposure to silica dust, asbestos, or coal dust and
if the employee, after the finding, has changed or shall change the employee's occupation to an
occupation in which the exposure to silica dust, asbestos, or coal dust is substantially decreased, the
administrator shall allow to the employee an amount equal to fifty per cent of the statewide average
weekly wage per week for a period of thirty weeks, commencing as of the date of the discontinuance
Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
27
or change, and for a period of one hundred weeks immediately following the expiration of the period
of thirty weeks, the employee shall receive sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the loss of wages
resulting directly and solely from the change of occupation but not to exceed a maximum of an
amount equal to fifty per cent of the statewide average weekly wage per week. No such employee is
entitled to receive more than one allowance on account of discontinuance of employment or change
of occupation and benefits shall cease for any period during which the employee is employed in an
occupation in which the exposure to silica dust, asbestos, or coal dust is not substantially less than
the exposure in the occupation in which the employee was formerly employed or for any period
during which the employee may be entitled to receive compensation or benefits under section

Section 20:
4123.68 of the Revised Code on account of disability from silicosis, asbestosis, or coal miners'
pneumoconiosis. An award for change of occupation for a coal miner who has contracted coal
miners' pneumoconiosis may be granted under this division even though the coal miner continues
employment with the same employer, so long as the coal miner's employment subsequent to the
change is such that the coal miner's exposure to coal dust is substantially decreased and a change of
occupation is certified by the claimant as permanent. The administrator may accord to the employee
medical and other benefits in accordance with section 4123.66 of the Revised Code.
(E) If a firefighter or police officer makes application for a finding and the administrator
finds that the firefighter or police officer has contracted a cardiovascular and pulmonary disease as
defined in division (W) of section 4123.68 of the Revised Code, and that a change of the firefighter's
or police officer's occupation is medically advisable in order to decrease substantially further
exposure to smoke, toxic gases, chemical fumes, and other toxic vapors, and if the firefighter, or
police officer, after the finding, has changed or changes occupation to an occupation in which the
exposure to smoke, toxic gases, chemical fumes, and other toxic vapors is substantially decreased,
the administrator shall allow to the firefighter or police officer an amount equal to fifty per cent of
the statewide average weekly wage per week for a period of thirty weeks, commencing as of the date
of the discontinuance or change, and for a period of seventy-five weeks immediately following the
expiration of the period of thirty weeks the administrator shall allow the firefighter or police officer
sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the loss of wages resulting directly and solely from the change of
occupation but not to exceed a maximum of an amount equal to fifty per cent of the statewide
average weekly wage per week. No such firefighter or police officer is entitled to receive more than
one allowance on account of discontinuance of employment or change of occupation and benefits
shall cease for any period during which the firefighter or police officer is employed in an occupation
in which the exposure to smoke, toxic gases, chemical fumes, and other toxic vapors is not
substantially less than the exposure in the occupation in which the firefighter or police officer was
formerly employed or for any period during which the firefighter or police officer may be entitled to
receive compensation or benefits under section 4123.68 of the Revised Code on account of disability
from a cardiovascular and pulmonary disease. The administrator may accord to the firefighter or
police officer medical and other benefits in accordance with section 4123.66 of the Revised Code.

and pay from the fund reasonable funeral expenses in an amount not to exceed seven thousand five
hundred dollars. The bureau of workers' compensation shall reimburse anyone, whether dependent,

with the advice and consent of the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors, with respect
to furnishing medical, nurse, and hospital service and medicine to injured or disabled employees
entitled thereto, and for the payment therefor. In case an injury or industrial accident that injures an
employee also causes damage to the employee's eyeglasses, artificial teeth or other denture, or
hearing aid, or in the event an injury or occupational disease makes it necessary or advisable to
replace, repair, or adjust the same, the bureau shall disburse and pay a reasonable amount to repair or
replace the same.

the date the administrator issues an initial determination order under division (B) of section

Section 22:
4123.511 of the Revised Code. If the claim is ultimately disallowed in a final administrative or
judicial order, and if the employer is a state fund employer who pays assessments into the surplus
fund account created under section 4123.34 of the Revised Code, the payments for medical services
made pursuant to this division for the first fill of prescription drugs shall be charged to and paid from
the surplus fund account and not charged through the state insurance fund to the employer against
whom the claim was filed.
(C)(1) If an employer or a welfare plan has provided to or on behalf of an employee any

disease is determined compensable under this chapter, the employer or a welfare plan may request
that the administrator reimburse the employer or welfare plan for the amount the employer or
welfare plan paid to or on behalf of the employee in compensation or benefits. The administrator
shall reimburse the employer or welfare plan for the compensation and benefits paid if, at the time
the employer or welfare plan provides the benefits or compensation to or on behalf of employee, the
injury or occupational disease had not been determined to be compensable under this chapter and if
the employee was not receiving compensation or benefits under this chapter for that injury or
occupational disease. The administrator shall reimburse the employer or welfare plan in the amount
Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
29
that the administrator would have paid to or on behalf of the employee under this chapter if the
injury or occupational disease originally would have been determined compensable under this
chapter. If the employer is a merit-rated employer, the administrator shall adjust the amount of
premium next due from the employer according to the amount the administrator pays the employer.

Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
35
employment while en route to the premises to be inspected or investigated, and that violation
presents a substantial probability that the condition or practice could result in death or serious
physical harm, the administrator or the administrator's designee may use any of the enforcement
mechanisms provided in this section to correct or remove the condition or practice.
(4) If, during an inspection or investigation, the administrator or the administrator's designee

employer. The citation shall be in writing and describe with particularity the nature of the alleged

rule, or order alleged to have been violated. In addition, the citation shall fix a time for the
abatement of the violation, as provided in division (H) of this section. The administrator may
prescribe procedures for the issuance of a notice with respect to minor violations and for
enforcement of minor violations that have no direct or immediate relationship to safety or health.
(E) Upon receipt of any citation under this section, the public employer shall immediately

days that the employer wishes to contest the citation, or if within fourteen days after the issuance of
a citation a public employee or public employee representative files notice that the time period fixed
in the citation for the abatement of the violation is unreasonable, the administrator shall hold an
adjudication hearing in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code.
(H) In establishing the time limits in which a public employer must abate a violation under
this section, the administrator shall consider the costs to the public employer, the size and financial
resources of the public employer, the severity of the violation, the technological feasibility of the
public employer's ability to comply with requirements of the citation, the possible present and future
detriment to the health and safety of any public employee for failure of the public employer to
comply with requirements of the citation, and such other factors as the administrator determines
appropriate. The administrator may, after considering the above factors, permit the public employer
to comply with the citation over a period of up to two years and may extend that period an additional
one year, as the administrator determines appropriate.
(I) Any public employer may request the administrator to conduct an employment risk
reduction inspection of the public employer's place of employment. The administrator or the
administrator's designee shall conduct the inspection within a reasonable amount of time following
the request. Neither the administrator nor any other person may use any information obtained from
the inspection for a period not to exceed three years in any proceeding for a violation of this chapter
or any rule or order issued thereunder nor in any other action in any court in this state.

S 1. That sections 4121.12, 4121.121, 4121.13, 4123.44, 4123.52, 4123.54, 4123.57,

read as follows:
Sec. 4121.12. (A) There is hereby created the bureau of workers' compensation board of
directors consisting of eleven members to be appointed by the governor with the advice and consent
of the senate. One member shall be an individual who, on account of the individual's previous
vocation, employment, or affiliations, can be classed as a representative of employees; two members
shall be individuals who, on account of their previous vocation, employment, or affiliations, can be
classed as representatives of employee organizations and at least one of these two individuals shall
be a member of the executive committee of the largest statewide labor federation; three members
shall be individuals who, on account of their previous vocation, employment, or affiliations, can be
classed as representatives of employers, one of whom represents self-insuring employers, one of
whom is a state fund employer who employs one hundred or more employees, and one of whom is a
state fund employer who employs less than one hundred employees; two members shall be
individuals who, on account of their vocation, employment, or affiliations, can be classed as
investment and securities experts who have direct experience in the management, analysis,
supervision, or investment of assets and are residents of this state; one member who shall be a
certified public accountant; one member who shall be an actuary who is a member in good standing
with the American academy of actuaries or who is an associate or fellow with the casualty actuarial
society; and one member shall represent the public and also be an individual who, on account of the
individual's previous vocation, employment, or affiliations, cannot be classed as either
predominantly representative of employees or of employers. The governor shall select the
chairperson of the board who shall serve as chairperson at the pleasure of the governor.
None of the members of the board, within one year immediately preceding the member's

Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
2
appointment, shall have been employed by the bureau of workers' compensation or by any person,
partnership, or corporation that has provided to the bureau services of a financial or investment
nature, including the management, analysis, supervision, or investment of assets.
(B) Of the initial appointments made to the board, the governor shall appoint the member
who represents employees, one member who represents employers, and the member who represents
the public to a term ending one year after June 11, 2007; one member who represents employers,
one member who represents employee organizations, one member who is an investment and
securities expert, and the member who is a certified public accountant to a term ending two years
after June 11, 2007; and one member who represents employers, one member who represents
employee organizations, one member who is an investment and securities expert, and the member
who is an actuary to a term ending three years after June 11, 2007. Thereafter, terms of office shall
be for three years, with each term ending on the same day of the same month as did the term that it
succeeds. Each member shall hold office from the date of the member's appointment until the end of
the term for which the member was appointed.
Members may be reappointed. Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the
expiration date of the term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office as a
member for the remainder of that term. A member shall continue in office subsequent to the
expiration date of the member's term until a successor takes office or until a period of sixty days has
elapsed, whichever occurs first.
(C) In making appointments to the board, the governor shall select the members from the list
of names submitted by the workers' compensation board of directors nominating committee pursuant
to this division. The nominating committee shall submit to the governor a list containing four
separate names for each of the members on the board. Within fourteen days after the submission of
the list, the governor shall appoint individuals from the list.
At least thirty days prior to a vacancy occurring as a result of the expiration of a term and
within thirty days after other vacancies occurring on the board, the nominating committee shall
submit an initial list containing four names for each vacancy. Within fourteen days after the
submission of the initial list, the governor either shall appoint individuals from that list or request the
nominating committee to submit another list of four names for each member the governor has not
appointed from the initial list, which list the nominating committee shall submit to the governor
within fourteen days after the governor's request. The governor then shall appoint, within seven days
after the submission of the second list, one of the individuals from either list to fill the vacancy for
which the governor has not made an appointment from the initial list. If the governor appoints an
individual to fill a vacancy occurring as a result of the expiration of a term, the individual appointed
shall begin serving as a member of the board when the term for which the individual's predecessor
was appointed expires or immediately upon appointment by the governor, whichever occurs later.
With respect to the filling of vacancies, the nominating committee shall provide the governor with a
list of four individuals who are, in the judgment of the nominating committee, the most fully

3

dollars during the two-year period immediately preceding the date of the appointment of the

(B) The administrator is responsible for the management of the bureau and for the discharge
of all administrative duties imposed upon the administrator in this chapter and Chapters 4123.,
4125., 4127., 4131., 4133., and 4167. of the Revised Code, and in the discharge thereof shall do all
of the following:
(1) Perform all acts and exercise all authorities and powers, discretionary and otherwise that
are required of or vested in the bureau or any of its employees in this chapter and Chapters 4123.,
4125., 4127., 4131., 4133., and 4167. of the Revised Code, except the acts and the exercise of
authority and power that is required of and vested in the bureau of workers' compensation board of
directors or the industrial commission pursuant to those chapters. The treasurer of state shall honor
all warrants signed by the administrator, or by one or more of the administrator's employees,
authorized by the administrator in writing, or bearing the facsimile signature of the administrator or
such employee under sections 4123.42 and 4123.44 of the Revised Code.
(2) Employ, direct, and supervise all employees required in connection with the performance
of the duties assigned to the bureau by this chapter and Chapters 4123., 4125., 4127., 4131., 4133.,
and 4167. of the Revised Code, including an actuary, and may establish job classification plans and
compensation for all employees of the bureau provided that this grant of authority shall not be
construed as affecting any employee for whom the state employment relations board has established
an appropriate bargaining unit under section 4117.06 of the Revised Code. All positions of
employment in the bureau are in the classified civil service except those employees the administrator
may appoint to serve at the administrator's pleasure in the unclassified civil service pursuant to
section 124.11 of the Revised Code. The administrator shall fix the salaries of employees the
administrator appoints to serve at the administrator's pleasure, including the chief operating officer,
staff physicians, staff certified nurse-midwives, staff clinical nurse specialists, staff certified nurse
practitioners, and other senior management personnel of the bureau and shall establish the
compensation of staff attorneys of the bureau's legal section and their immediate supervisors, and
take whatever steps are necessary to provide adequate compensation for other staff attorneys.
The administrator may appoint a person who holds a certified position in the classified
service within the bureau to a position in the unclassified service within the bureau. A person
appointed pursuant to this division to a position in the unclassified service shall retain the right to
resume the position and status held by the person in the classified service immediately prior to the

Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
8
person's appointment in the unclassified service, regardless of the number of positions the person
held in the unclassified service. An employee's right to resume a position in the classified service
may only be exercised when the administrator demotes the employee to a pay range lower than the
employee's current pay range or revokes the employee's appointment to the unclassified service. An
employee who holds a position in the classified service and who is appointed to a position in the
unclassified service on or after January 1, 2016, shall have the right to resume a position in the
classified service under this division only within five years after the effective date of the employee's
appointment in the unclassified service. An employee forfeits the right to resume a position in the
classified service when the employee is removed from the position in the unclassified service due to
incompetence, inefficiency, dishonesty, drunkenness, immoral conduct, insubordination,
discourteous treatment of the public, neglect of duty, violation of this chapter or Chapter 124., 4123.,
4125., 4127., 4131., 4133., or 4167. of the Revised Code, violation of the rules of the director of
administrative services or the administrator, any other failure of good behavior, any other acts of
misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in office, or conviction of a felony while employed in the
civil service. An employee also forfeits the right to resume a position in the classified service upon
transfer to a different agency.
Reinstatement to a position in the classified service shall be to a position substantially equal
to that position in the classified service held previously, as certified by the department of
administrative services. If the position the person previously held in the classified service has been
placed in the unclassified service or is otherwise unavailable, the person shall be appointed to a
position in the classified service within the bureau that the director of administrative services
certifies is comparable in compensation to the position the person previously held in the classified
service. Service in the position in the unclassified service shall be counted as service in the position
in the classified service held by the person immediately prior to the person's appointment in the
unclassified service. When a person is reinstated to a position in the classified service as provided in
this division, the person is entitled to all rights, status, and benefits accruing to the position during
the person's time of service in the position in the unclassified service.
(3) Reorganize the work of the bureau, its sections, departments, and offices to the extent
necessary to achieve the most efficient performance of its functions and to that end may establish,
change, or abolish positions and assign and reassign duties and responsibilities of every employee of
the bureau. All persons employed by the commission in positions that, after November 3, 1989, are
supervised and directed by the administrator under this section are transferred to the bureau in their
respective classifications but subject to reassignment and reclassification of position and
compensation as the administrator determines to be in the interest of efficient administration. The
civil service status of any person employed by the commission is not affected by this section.
Personnel employed by the bureau or the commission who are subject to Chapter 4117. of the
Revised Code shall retain all of their rights and benefits conferred pursuant to that chapter as it
presently exists or is hereafter amended and nothing in this chapter or Chapter 4123. of the Revised

Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
9
Code shall be construed as eliminating or interfering with Chapter 4117. of the Revised Code or the
rights and benefits conferred under that chapter to public employees or to any bargaining unit.
(4) Provide offices, equipment, supplies, and other facilities for the bureau.
(5) Prepare and submit to the board information the administrator considers pertinent or the
board requires, together with the administrator's recommendations, in the form of administrative
rules, for the advice and consent of the board, for classifications of occupations or industries, for
premium rates and contributions, for the amount to be credited to the surplus fund, for rules and
systems of rating, rate revisions, and merit rating. The administrator shall obtain, prepare, and
submit any other information the board requires for the prompt and efficient discharge of its duties.
(6) Keep the accounts required by division (A) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code and
all other accounts and records necessary to the collection, administration, and distribution of the
workers' compensation funds and shall obtain the statistical and other information required by
section 4123.19 of the Revised Code.
(7) Exercise the investment powers vested in the administrator by section 4123.44 of the
Revised Code in accordance with the investment policy approved by the board pursuant to section
4121.12 of the Revised Code and in consultation with the chief investment officer of the bureau of
workers' compensation. The administrator shall not engage in any prohibited investment activity
specified by the board pursuant to division (F)(9) of section 4121.12 of the Revised Code and shall
not invest in any type of investment specified in divisions (B)(1) to (10) of section 4123.442 of the
Revised Code. All business shall be transacted, all funds invested, all warrants for money drawn and
payments made, and all cash and securities and other property held, in the name of the bureau, or in
the name of its nominee, provided that nominees are authorized by the administrator solely for the
purpose of facilitating the transfer of securities, and restricted to the administrator and designated
employees.
(8) In accordance with Chapter 125. of the Revised Code, purchase supplies, materials,
equipment, and services.
(9) Prepare and submit to the board an annual budget for internal operating purposes for the
board's approval. The administrator also shall, separately from the budget the industrial commission
submits, prepare and submit to the director of budget and management a budget for each biennium.
The budgets budget submitted to the board and the director shall include estimates of the costs and
necessary expenditures of the bureau in the discharge of any duty imposed by law.
(10) As promptly as possible in the course of efficient administration, decentralize and
relocate such of the personnel and activities of the bureau as is appropriate to the end that the
receipt, investigation, determination, and payment of claims may be undertaken at or near the place
of injury or the residence of the claimant and for that purpose establish regional offices, in such
places as the administrator considers proper, capable of discharging as many of the functions of the
bureau as is practicable so as to promote prompt and efficient administration in the processing of
claims. All active and inactive lost-time claims files shall be held at the service office responsible for

Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
10
the claim. A claimant, at the claimant's request, shall be provided with information by telephone as
to the location of the file pertaining to the claimant's claim. The administrator shall ensure that all
service office employees report directly to the director for their service office.
(11) Provide a written binder on new coverage where the administrator considers it to be in
the best interest of the risk. The administrator, or any other person authorized by the administrator,
shall grant the binder upon submission of a request for coverage by the employer. A binder is
effective for a period of thirty days from date of issuance and is nonrenewable. Payroll reports and
premium charges shall coincide with the effective date of the binder.
(12) Set standards for the reasonable and maximum handling time of claims payment
functions, ensure, by rules, the impartial and prompt treatment of all claims and employer risk
accounts, and establish a secure, accurate method of time stamping all incoming mail and documents

purchase, repair, or replacement is necessary due to an amputation or loss that resulted from an
allowed injury or occupational disease.

during which the commission or administrator may modify or change a former finding or order in a
claim as provided under division (A) of this section.
(C) Notwithstanding division (A) of this section, and except as otherwise provided in a rule
that shall be adopted by the administrator, with the advice and consent of the bureau of workers'
compensation board of directors, neither the administrator nor the commission shall make any
finding or award for payment of medical or vocational rehabilitation services submitted for payment
more than one year after the date the services were rendered or more than one year after the date the

subsequent to the filing of any such application, provided the application is filed within the time
limit provided in this section.
(E)(F) This section does not deprive the commission of its continuing jurisdiction to
determine the questions raised by any application for modification of award which has been filed
with the commission after June 1, 1932, and prior to the expiration of the applicable period but in

films, or other direct or electronic document retention media, when properly identified, have the
same effect as the original record and may be offered in like manner and may be received as
evidence in proceedings before the industrial commission, staff hearing officers, and district hearing

Sec. 4123.54. (A) Except as otherwise provided in this division or divisions (I) and (K) of
this section, every employee, who is injured or who contracts an occupational disease, and the
dependents of each employee who is killed, or dies as the result of an occupational disease
contracted in the course of employment, wherever the injury has occurred or occupational disease
has been contracted, is entitled to receive the compensation for loss sustained on account of the
injury, occupational disease, or death, and the medical, nurse, and hospital services and medicines,
and the amount of funeral expenses in case of death, as are provided by this chapter. The
compensation and benefits shall be provided, as applicable, directly from the employee's self-
insuring employer as provided in section 4123.35 of the Revised Code or from the state insurance
fund. An employee or dependent is not entitled to receive compensation or benefits under this
division if the employee's injury or occupational disease is either of the following:
(1) Purposely self-inflicted;
(2) Caused by the employee being intoxicated, under the influence of a controlled substance
not prescribed by a physician, certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse
practitioner, or under the influence of marihuana if being intoxicated, under the influence of a
controlled substance not prescribed by a physician, certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse specialist,
or certified nurse practitioner, or under the influence of marihuana was the proximate cause of the
injury.
(B) For the purpose of this section, provided that an employer has posted written notice to
employees that the results of, or the employee's refusal to submit to, any chemical test described
under this division may affect the employee's eligibility for compensation and benefits pursuant to
this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code, there is a rebuttable presumption that an
employee is intoxicated, under the influence of a controlled substance not prescribed by the
employee's physician, certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse
practitioner, or under the influence of marihuana and that being intoxicated, under the influence of a
controlled substance not prescribed by the employee's physician, certified nurse-midwife, clinical
nurse specialist, or certified nurse practitioner, or under the influence of marihuana is the proximate
cause of an injury under either of the following conditions:
(1) When any one or more of the following is true:
(a) The employee, through a qualifying chemical test administered within eight hours of an
injury, is determined to have an alcohol concentration level equal to or in excess of the levels
established in divisions (A)(1)(b) to (i) of section 4511.19 of the Revised Code.
(b) The employee, through a qualifying chemical test administered within thirty-two hours of
an injury, is determined to have a controlled substance not prescribed by the employee's physician,

Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.

certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse practitioner or marihuana in the
employee's system at a level equal to or in excess of the cutoff concentration level for the particular
substance as provided in section 40.87 40.85 of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 49
C.F.R. 40.8740.85, as amendedit existed on January 1, 2024, or as subsequently amended as a result
of a statute or rule.
(c) The employee, through a qualifying chemical test administered within thirty-two hours of
an injury, is determined to have barbiturates, benzodiazepines, or methadone in the employee's
system that tests above levels established by laboratories certified by the United States department of
health and human services.
(2) When the employee refuses to submit to a requested chemical test, on the condition that
that employee is or was given notice that the refusal to submit to any chemical test described in
division (B)(1) of this section may affect the employee's eligibility for compensation and benefits
under this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code.
(C)(1) For purposes of division (B) of this section, a chemical test is a qualifying chemical
test if it is administered to an employee after an injury under at least one of the following conditions:
(a) When the employee's employer had reasonable cause to suspect that the employee may
be intoxicated, under the influence of a controlled substance not prescribed by the employee's
physician, certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse practitioner, or under
the influence of marihuana;
(b) At the request of a police officer pursuant to section 4511.191 of the Revised Code, and
not at the request of the employee's employer;
(c) At the request of a licensed physician, certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse specialist,
or certified nurse practitioner who is not employed by the employee's employer, and not at the
request of the employee's employer.
(2) As used in division (C)(1)(a) of this section, "reasonable cause" means, but is not limited
to, evidence that an employee is or was using alcohol, a controlled substance, or marihuana drawn
from specific, objective facts and reasonable inferences drawn from these facts in light of experience
and training. These facts and inferences may be based on, but are not limited to, any of the
following:
(a) Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of use, possession, or distribution of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or marihuana, or of the physical symptoms of being under the
influence of alcohol, a controlled substance, or marihuana, such as but not limited to slurred speech;
dilated pupils; odor of alcohol, a controlled substance, or marihuana; changes in affect; or dynamic
mood swings;
(b) A pattern of abnormal conduct, erratic or aberrant behavior, or deteriorating work
performance such as frequent absenteeism, excessive tardiness, or recurrent accidents, that appears
to be related to the use of alcohol, a controlled substance, or marihuana, and does not appear to be
attributable to other factors;

Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
18
(c) The identification of an employee as the focus of a criminal investigation into
unauthorized possession, use, or trafficking of a controlled substance or marihuana;
(d) A report of use of alcohol, a controlled substance, or marihuana provided by a reliable

property damage and that appear to be related to the use of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
marihuana and that do not appear attributable to other factors.
(D) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the rights of an employer to test
employees for alcohol or controlled substance abuse.
(E) For the purpose of this section, laboratories certified by the United States department of
health and human services or laboratories that meet or exceed the standards of that department for
laboratory certification shall be used for processing the test results of a qualifying chemical test.
(F) The written notice required by division (B) of this section shall be the same size or larger
than the proof of workers' compensation coverage furnished by the bureau of workers' compensation
and shall be posted by the employer in the same location as the proof of workers' compensation
coverage or the certificate of self-insurance.
(G) If a condition that pre-existed an injury is substantially aggravated by the injury, and that
substantial aggravation is documented by objective diagnostic findings, objective clinical findings,
or objective test results, no compensation or benefits are payable because of the pre-existing
condition once that condition has returned to a level that would have existed without the injury.
(H)(1) Whenever, with respect to an employee of an employer who is subject to and has
complied with this chapter, there is possibility of conflict with respect to the application of workers'
compensation laws because the contract of employment is entered into and all or some portion of the
work is or is to be performed in a state or states other than Ohio, the employer and the employee
may agree to be bound by the laws of this state or by the laws of some other state in which all or
some portion of the work of the employee is to be performed. The agreement shall be in writing and
shall be filed with the bureau of workers' compensation within ten days after it is executed and shall
remain in force until terminated or modified by agreement of the parties similarly filed. If the
agreement is to be bound by the laws of this state and the employer has complied with this chapter,
then the employee is entitled to compensation and benefits regardless of where the injury occurs or
the disease is contracted and the rights of the employee and the employee's dependents under the
laws of this state are the exclusive remedy against the employer on account of injury, disease, or
death in the course of and arising out of the employee's employment. If the agreement is to be bound
by the laws of another state and the employer has complied with the laws of that state, the rights of
the employee and the employee's dependents under the laws of that state are the exclusive remedy
against the employer on account of injury, disease, or death in the course of and arising out of the
employee's employment without regard to the place where the injury was sustained or the disease

Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
19
contracted. If an employer and an employee enter into an agreement under this division, the fact that
the employer and the employee entered into that agreement shall not be construed to change the
status of an employee whose continued employment is subject to the will of the employer or the
employee, unless the agreement contains a provision that expressly changes that status.
(2) If an employee or the employee's dependents receive an award of compensation or
benefits under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for the same
injury, occupational disease, or death for which the employee or the employee's dependents
previously pursued or otherwise elected to accept workers' compensation benefits and received a
decision on the merits as defined in section 4123.542 of the Revised Code under the laws of another
state or recovered damages under the laws of another state, the claim shall be disallowed and the
administrator or any self-insuring employer, by any lawful means, may collect from the employee or
the employee's dependents any of the following:
(a) The amount of compensation or benefits paid to or on behalf of the employee or the
employee's dependents by the administrator or a self-insuring employer pursuant to this chapter or
Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for that award;
(b) Any interest, attorney's fees, and costs the administrator or the self-insuring employer
incurs in collecting that payment.
(3) If an employee or the employee's dependents receive an award of compensation or
benefits under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code and subsequently
pursue or otherwise elect to accept workers' compensation benefits or damages under the laws of
another state for the same injury, occupational disease, or death the claim under this chapter or
Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code shall be disallowed. The administrator or a self-
insuring employer, by any lawful means, may collect from the employee or the employee's
dependents or other-states' insurer any of the following:
(a) The amount of compensation or benefits paid to or on behalf of the employee or the
employee's dependents by the administrator or the self-insuring employer pursuant to this chapter or
Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for that award;
(b) Any interest, costs, and attorney's fees the administrator or the self-insuring employer
incurs in collecting that payment;
(c) Any costs incurred by an employer in contesting or responding to any claim filed by the
employee or the employee's dependents for the same injury, occupational disease, or death that was
filed after the original claim for which the employee or the employee's dependents received a
decision on the merits as described in section 4123.542 of the Revised Code.
(4) If the employee's employer pays premiums into the state insurance fund, the
administrator shall not charge the amount of compensation or benefits the administrator collects
pursuant to division (H)(2) or (3) of this section to the employer's experience. If the administrator
collects any costs incurred by an employer in contesting or responding to any claim pursuant to
division (H)(2) or (3) of this section, the administrator shall forward the amount collected to that

Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
20
employer. If the employee's employer is a self-insuring employer, the self-insuring employer shall
deduct the amount of compensation or benefits the self-insuring employer collects pursuant to this
division from the paid compensation the self-insuring employer reports to the administrator under
division (L) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code.
(5) If an employee is a resident of a state other than this state and is insured under the
workers' compensation law or similar laws of a state other than this state, the employee and the
employee's dependents are not entitled to receive compensation or benefits under this chapter, on
account of injury, disease, or death arising out of or in the course of employment while temporarily
within this state, and the rights of the employee and the employee's dependents under the laws of the
other state are the exclusive remedy against the employer on account of the injury, disease, or death.
(6) An employee, or the dependent of an employee, who elects to receive compensation and
benefits under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for a claim may
not receive compensation and benefits under the workers' compensation laws of any state other than
this state for that same claim. For each claim submitted by or on behalf of an employee, the
administrator or, if the employee is employed by a self-insuring employer, the self-insuring
employer, shall request the employee or the employee's dependent to sign an election that affirms
the employee's or employee's dependent's acceptance of electing to receive compensation and
benefits under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for that claim that
also affirmatively waives and releases the employee's or the employee's dependent's right to file for
and receive compensation and benefits under the laws of any state other than this state for that claim.
The employee or employee's dependent shall sign the election form within twenty-eight days after
the administrator or self-insuring employer submits the request or the administrator or self-insuring
employer shall dismiss that claim.
In the event a workers' compensation claim has been filed in another jurisdiction on behalf of
an employee or the dependents of an employee, and the employee or dependents subsequently elect
to receive compensation, benefits, or both under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the
Revised Code, the employee or dependent shall withdraw or refuse acceptance of the workers'
compensation claim filed in the other jurisdiction in order to pursue compensation or benefits under
the laws of this state. If the employee or dependents were awarded workers' compensation benefits
or had recovered damages under the laws of the other state, any compensation and benefits awarded
under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code shall be paid only to the
extent to which those payments exceed the amounts paid under the laws of the other state. If the
employee or dependent fails to withdraw or to refuse acceptance of the workers' compensation claim
in the other jurisdiction within twenty-eight days after a request made by the administrator or a self-
insuring employer, the administrator or self-insuring employer shall dismiss the employee's or
employee's dependents' claim made in this state.
(I) If an employee who is covered under the federal "Longshore and Harbor Workers'
Compensation Act," 98 Stat. 1639, 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq., is injured or contracts an occupational

Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
21
disease or dies as a result of an injury or occupational disease, and if that employee's or that
employee's dependents' claim for compensation or benefits for that injury, occupational disease, or
death is subject to the jurisdiction of that act, the employee or the employee's dependents are not
entitled to apply for and shall not receive compensation or benefits under this chapter and Chapter
4121. of the Revised Code. The rights of such an employee and the employee's dependents under the
federal "Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act," 98 Stat. 1639, 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq.,
are the exclusive remedy against the employer for that injury, occupational disease, or death.
(J) Compensation or benefits are not payable to a claimant or a dependent during the period
of confinement of the claimant or dependent in any state or federal correctional institution, or in any
county jail in lieu of incarceration in a state or federal correctional institution, whether in this or any
other state for conviction of violation of any state or federal criminal law.
(K) An employer, upon the approval of the administrator, may provide for workers'
compensation coverage for the employer's employees who are professional athletes and coaches by
submitting to the administrator proof of coverage under a league policy issued under the laws of
another state under either of the following circumstances:
(1) The employer administers the payroll and workers' compensation insurance for a
professional sports team subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and the collective bargaining
agreement provides for the uniform administration of workers' compensation benefits and
compensation for professional athletes.
(2) The employer is a professional sports league, or is a member team of a professional
sports league, and all of the following apply:
(a) The professional sports league operates as a single entity, whereby all of the players and
coaches of the sports league are employees of the sports league and not of the individual member
teams.
(b) The professional sports league at all times maintains workers' compensation insurance
that provides coverage for the players and coaches of the sports league.
(c) Each individual member team of the professional sports league, pursuant to the
organizational or operating documents of the sports league, is obligated to the sports league to pay to
the sports league any workers' compensation claims that are not covered by the workers'
compensation insurance maintained by the sports league.
If the administrator approves the employer's proof of coverage submitted under division (K)
of this section, a professional athlete or coach who is an employee of the employer and the
dependents of the professional athlete or coach are not entitled to apply for and shall not receive
compensation or benefits under this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code. The rights of
such an athlete or coach and the dependents of such an athlete or coach under the laws of the state
where the policy was issued are the exclusive remedy against the employer for the athlete or coach if
the athlete or coach suffers an injury or contracts an occupational disease in the course of
employment, or for the dependents of the athlete or the coach if the athlete or coach is killed as a

Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
22
result of an injury or dies as a result of an occupational disease, regardless of the location where the
injury was suffered or the occupational disease was contracted.
Sec. 4123.57. Partial disability compensation shall be paid as follows.
Except as provided in this section, not earlier than twenty-six weeks after the date of
termination of the latest period of payments under section 4123.56 of the Revised Code or twenty-
six weeks after the termination of wages in lieu of those payments, or not earlier than twenty-six
weeks after the date of the injury or contraction of an occupational disease in the absence of
payments under section 4123.56 of the Revised Code or wages in lieu of those payments, the
employee may file an application with the bureau of workers' compensation for the determination of
the percentage of the employee's permanent partial disability resulting from an injury or
occupational disease.
Whenever the application is filed, the bureau shall send a copy of the application to the
employee's employer or the employer's representative and shall schedule the employee for a medical
examination by the bureau medical section. The bureau shall send a copy of the report of the medical
examination to the employee, the employer, and their representatives. Thereafter, the administrator
of workers' compensation shall review the employee's claim file and make a tentative order as the
evidence before the administrator at the time of the making of the order warrants. If the
administrator determines that there is a conflict of evidence, the administrator shall send the
application, along with the claimant's file, to the district hearing officer who shall set the application
for a hearing.
If an employee fails to respond to an attempt to schedule a medical examination by the
bureau medical section, or fails to attend a medical examination scheduled under this section without
notice or explanation, the employee's application for a finding shall be dismissed without prejudice.
The employee may refile the application. A dismissed application does not toll the continuing
jurisdiction of the industrial commission under section 4123.52 of the Revised Code. The
administrator shall adopt rules addressing the manner in which an employee will be notified of a
possible dismissal and how an employee may refile an application for a determination.
The administrator shall notify the employee, the employer, and their representatives, in
writing, of the tentative order and of the parties' right to request a hearing. Unless the employee, the
employer, or their representative notifies the administrator, in writing, of an objection to the
tentative order within twenty days after receipt of the notice thereof, the tentative order shall go into
effect and the employee shall receive the compensation provided in the order. In no event shall there
be a reconsideration of a tentative order issued under this division.
If the employee, the employer, or their representatives timely notify the administrator of an
objection to the tentative order, the matter shall be referred to a district hearing officer who shall set
the application for hearing with written notices to all interested persons. Upon referral to a district
hearing officer, the employer may obtain a medical examination of the employee, pursuant to rules
of the industrial commission.

Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
23
(A) The district hearing officer, upon the application, shall determine the percentage of the
employee's permanent disability, except as is subject to division (B) of this section, based upon that
condition of the employee resulting from the injury or occupational disease and causing permanent
impairment evidenced by medical or clinical findings reasonably demonstrable. The employee shall
receive sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the employee's average weekly wage, but not more than
a maximum of thirty-three and one-third per cent of the statewide average weekly wage as defined in
division (C) of section 4123.62 of the Revised Code, per week regardless of the average weekly
wage, for the number of weeks which equals the percentage of two hundred weeks. Except on
application for reconsideration, review, or modification, which is filed within ten days after the date
of receipt of the decision of the district hearing officer, in no instance shall the former award be
modified unless it is found from medical or clinical findings that the condition of the claimant
resulting from the injury has so progressed as to have increased the percentage of permanent partial
disability. A staff hearing officer shall hear an application for reconsideration filed and the staff
hearing officer's decision is final. An employee may file an application for a subsequent
determination of the percentage of the employee's permanent disability. If such an application is
filed, the bureau shall send a copy of the application to the employer or the employer's
representative. No sooner than sixty days from the date of the mailing of the application to the
employer or the employer's representative, the administrator shall review the application. The
administrator may require a medical examination or medical review of the employee. The
administrator shall issue a tentative order based upon the evidence before the administrator, provided
that if the administrator requires a medical examination or medical review, the administrator shall
not issue the tentative order until the completion of the examination or review.
The employer may obtain a medical examination of the employee and may submit medical
evidence at any stage of the process up to a hearing before the district hearing officer, pursuant to
rules of the commission. The administrator shall notify the employee, the employer, and their
representatives, in writing, of the nature and amount of any tentative order issued on an application
requesting a subsequent determination of the percentage of an employee's permanent disability. An
employee, employer, or their representatives may object to the tentative order within twenty days
after the receipt of the notice thereof. If no timely objection is made, the tentative order shall go into
effect. In no event shall there be a reconsideration of a tentative order issued under this division. If
an objection is timely made, the application for a subsequent determination shall be referred to a
district hearing officer who shall set the application for a hearing with written notice to all interested
persons. No application for subsequent percentage determinations on the same claim for injury or
occupational disease shall be accepted for review by the district hearing officer unless supported by
substantial evidence of new and changed circumstances developing since the time of the hearing on
the original or last determination.
No award shall be made under this division based upon a percentage of disability which,
when taken with all other percentages of permanent disability, exceeds one hundred per cent. If the

Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
24
percentage of the permanent disability of the employee equals or exceeds ninety per cent,
compensation for permanent partial disability shall be paid for two hundred weeks.
Compensation payable under this division accrues and is payable to the employee from the
date of last payment of compensation, or, in cases where no previous compensation has been paid,
from the date of the injury or the date of the diagnosis of the occupational disease.
When an award under this division has been made prior to the death of an employee, all
unpaid installments accrued or to accrue under the provisions of the award are payable to the
surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse, to the dependent children of the employee, and
if there are no children surviving, then to other dependents as the administrator determines.
(B) For purposes of this division, "payable per week" means the seven-consecutive-day
period in which compensation is paid in installments according to the schedule associated with the
applicable injury as set forth in this division.
Compensation paid in weekly installments according to the schedule described in this
division may only be commuted to one or more lump sum payments pursuant to the procedure set
forth in section 4123.64 of the Revised Code.
In cases included in the following schedule the compensation payable per week to the
employee is the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 4123.62 of the
Revised Code per week and shall be paid in installments according to the following schedule:
For the loss of a first finger, commonly known as a thumb, sixty weeks.
For the loss of a second finger, commonly called index finger, thirty-five weeks.
For the loss of a third finger, thirty weeks.
For the loss of a fourth finger, twenty weeks.
For the loss of a fifth finger, commonly known as the little finger, fifteen weeks.
The loss of a second, or distal, phalange of the thumb is considered equal to the loss of one
half of such thumb; the loss of more than one half of such thumb is considered equal to the loss of
the whole thumb.
The loss of the third, or distal, phalange of any finger is considered equal to the loss of one-
third of the finger.
The loss of the middle, or second, phalange of any finger is considered equal to the loss of
two-thirds of the finger.
The loss of more than the middle and distal phalanges of any finger is considered equal to
the loss of the whole finger. In no case shall the amount received for more than one finger exceed
the amount provided in this schedule for the loss of a hand.
For the loss of the metacarpal bone (bones of the palm) for the corresponding thumb, or
fingers, add ten weeks to the number of weeks under this division.
For ankylosis (total stiffness of) or contractures (due to scars or injuries) which makes any of
the fingers, thumbs, or parts of either useless, the same number of weeks apply to the members or
parts thereof as given for the loss thereof.

Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
25
If the claimant has suffered the loss of two or more fingers by amputation or ankylosis and
the nature of the claimant's employment in the course of which the claimant was working at the time
of the injury or occupational disease is such that the impairment or disability resulting from the loss
of fingers, or loss of use of fingers, exceeds the normal impairment or disability resulting from the
loss of fingers, or loss of use of fingers, the administrator may take that fact into consideration and
increase the award of compensation accordingly, but the award made shall not exceed the amount of
compensation for loss of a hand.
For the loss of a hand, one hundred seventy-five weeks.
For the loss of an arm, two hundred twenty-five weeks.
For the loss of a great toe, thirty weeks.
For the loss of one of the toes other than the great toe, ten weeks.
The loss of more than two-thirds of any toe is considered equal to the loss of the whole toe.
The loss of less than two-thirds of any toe is considered no loss, except as to the great toe;
the loss of the great toe up to the interphalangeal joint is co-equal to the loss of one-half of the great
toe; the loss of the great toe beyond the interphalangeal joint is considered equal to the loss of the
whole great toe.
For the loss of a foot, one hundred fifty weeks.
For the loss of a leg, two hundred weeks.
For the loss of the sight of an eye, one hundred twenty-five weeks.
For the permanent partial loss of sight of an eye, the portion of one hundred twenty-five
weeks as the administrator in each case determines, based upon the percentage of vision actually lost
as a result of the injury or occupational disease, but, in no case shall an award of compensation be
made for less than twenty-five per cent loss of uncorrected vision. "Loss of uncorrected vision"
means the percentage of vision actually lost as the result of the injury or occupational disease.
For the permanent and total loss of hearing of one ear, twenty-five weeks; but in no case
shall an award of compensation be made for less than permanent and total loss of hearing of one ear.
For the permanent and total loss of hearing, one hundred twenty-five weeks; but, except
pursuant to the next preceding paragraph, in no case shall an award of compensation be made for
less than permanent and total loss of hearing.
In case an injury or occupational disease results in serious facial or head disfigurement
which either impairs or may in the future impair the opportunities to secure or retain employment,
the administrator shall make an award of compensation as it deems proper and equitable, in view of
the nature of the disfigurement, and not to exceed the sum of ten thousand dollars. For the purpose
of making the award, it is not material whether the employee is gainfully employed in any
occupation or trade at the time of the administrator's determination.
When an award under this division has been made prior to the death of an employee all
unpaid installments accrued or to accrue under the provisions of the award shall be payable to the
surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse, to the dependent children of the employee and if

Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
26
there are no such children, then to such dependents as the administrator determines.
When an employee has sustained the loss of a member by severance, but no award has been
made on account thereof prior to the employee's death, the administrator shall make an award in
accordance with this division for the loss which shall be payable to the surviving spouse, or if there
is no surviving spouse, to the dependent children of the employee and if there are no such children,
then to such dependents as the administrator determines.
(C) Compensation for partial impairment under divisions (A) and (B) of this section is in
addition to the compensation paid the employee pursuant to section 4123.56 of the Revised Code. A
claimant may receive compensation under divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
In all cases arising under division (B) of this section, if it is determined by any one of the
following: (1) the amputee clinic at University hospital, Ohio state university; (2) the opportunities
for Ohioans with disabilities agency; (3) an amputee clinic or prescribing physician approved by the
administrator or the administrator's designee, that an injured or disabled employee is in need of an
artificial appliance, or in need of a repair thereof, regardless of whether the appliance or its repair
will be serviceable in the vocational rehabilitation of the injured employee, and regardless of
whether the employee has returned to or can ever again return to any gainful employment, the
bureau shall pay the cost of the artificial appliance or its repair out of the surplus created by division
(B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code.
Notwithstanding any provision in this division to the contrary, when a claimant has sustained
an amputation or a loss enumerated in division (B) of this section as a result of an injury or
occupational disease, the administrator shall pay the cost to purchase, repair, or replace a prosthetic
device as defined in division (B) of section 4123.52 from the surplus fund account created pursuant
to division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code, even if no award has been made under
division (B) of this section.
In those cases where an opportunities for Ohioans with disabilities agency's recommendation
that an injured or disabled employee is in need of an artificial appliance would conflict with their
state plan, adopted pursuant to the "Rehabilitation Act of 1973," 87 Stat. 355, 29 U.S.C.A. 701, the
administrator or the administrator's designee or the bureau may obtain a recommendation from an
amputee clinic or prescribing physician that they determine appropriate.
(D) If an employee of a state fund employer makes application for a finding and the
administrator finds that the employee has contracted silicosis as defined in division (Y), or coal
miners' pneumoconiosis as defined in division (Z), or asbestosis as defined in division (BB) of
section 4123.68 of the Revised Code, and that a change of such employee's occupation is medically
advisable in order to decrease substantially further exposure to silica dust, asbestos, or coal dust and
if the employee, after the finding, has changed or shall change the employee's occupation to an
occupation in which the exposure to silica dust, asbestos, or coal dust is substantially decreased, the
administrator shall allow to the employee an amount equal to fifty per cent of the statewide average
weekly wage per week for a period of thirty weeks, commencing as of the date of the discontinuance

Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
27
or change, and for a period of one hundred weeks immediately following the expiration of the period
of thirty weeks, the employee shall receive sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the loss of wages
resulting directly and solely from the change of occupation but not to exceed a maximum of an
amount equal to fifty per cent of the statewide average weekly wage per week. No such employee is
entitled to receive more than one allowance on account of discontinuance of employment or change
of occupation and benefits shall cease for any period during which the employee is employed in an
occupation in which the exposure to silica dust, asbestos, or coal dust is not substantially less than
the exposure in the occupation in which the employee was formerly employed or for any period
during which the employee may be entitled to receive compensation or benefits under section
4123.68 of the Revised Code on account of disability from silicosis, asbestosis, or coal miners'
pneumoconiosis. An award for change of occupation for a coal miner who has contracted coal
miners' pneumoconiosis may be granted under this division even though the coal miner continues
employment with the same employer, so long as the coal miner's employment subsequent to the
change is such that the coal miner's exposure to coal dust is substantially decreased and a change of
occupation is certified by the claimant as permanent. The administrator may accord to the employee
medical and other benefits in accordance with section 4123.66 of the Revised Code.
(E) If a firefighter or police officer makes application for a finding and the administrator
finds that the firefighter or police officer has contracted a cardiovascular and pulmonary disease as
defined in division (W) of section 4123.68 of the Revised Code, and that a change of the firefighter's
or police officer's occupation is medically advisable in order to decrease substantially further
exposure to smoke, toxic gases, chemical fumes, and other toxic vapors, and if the firefighter, or
police officer, after the finding, has changed or changes occupation to an occupation in which the
exposure to smoke, toxic gases, chemical fumes, and other toxic vapors is substantially decreased,
the administrator shall allow to the firefighter or police officer an amount equal to fifty per cent of
the statewide average weekly wage per week for a period of thirty weeks, commencing as of the date
of the discontinuance or change, and for a period of seventy-five weeks immediately following the
expiration of the period of thirty weeks the administrator shall allow the firefighter or police officer
sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the loss of wages resulting directly and solely from the change of
occupation but not to exceed a maximum of an amount equal to fifty per cent of the statewide
average weekly wage per week. No such firefighter or police officer is entitled to receive more than
one allowance on account of discontinuance of employment or change of occupation and benefits
shall cease for any period during which the firefighter or police officer is employed in an occupation
in which the exposure to smoke, toxic gases, chemical fumes, and other toxic vapors is not
substantially less than the exposure in the occupation in which the firefighter or police officer was
formerly employed or for any period during which the firefighter or police officer may be entitled to
receive compensation or benefits under section 4123.68 of the Revised Code on account of disability
from a cardiovascular and pulmonary disease. The administrator may accord to the firefighter or
police officer medical and other benefits in accordance with section 4123.66 of the Revised Code.

Revised Code but is not appealable to court under section 4123.512 of the Revised Code.
Sec. 4123.66. (A) In addition to the compensation provided for in this chapter, the
administrator of workers' compensation shall disburse and pay from the state insurance fund the
amounts for medical, nurse, and hospital services and medicine as the administrator deems proper
and, in case death ensues from the injury or occupational disease, the administrator shall disburse
and pay from the fund reasonable funeral expenses in an amount not to exceed seven thousand five
hundred dollars. The bureau of workers' compensation shall reimburse anyone, whether dependent,
volunteer, or otherwise, who pays the funeral expenses of any employee whose death ensues from
any injury or occupational disease as provided in this section. The administrator may adopt rules,
with the advice and consent of the bureau of workers' compensation board of directors, with respect
to furnishing medical, nurse, and hospital service and medicine to injured or disabled employees
entitled thereto, and for the payment therefor. In case an injury or industrial accident that injures an
employee also causes damage to the employee's eyeglasses, artificial teeth or other denture, or
hearing aid, or in the event an injury or occupational disease makes it necessary or advisable to
replace, repair, or adjust the same, the bureau shall disburse and pay a reasonable amount to repair or
replace the same.
(B) The administrator, in the rules the administrator adopts pursuant to division (A) of this
section, may adopt rules specifying the circumstances under which the bureau may make immediate
payment for the first fill of prescription drugs for medical conditions identified in an application for
compensation or benefits under section 4123.84 or 4123.85 of the Revised Code that occurs prior to
the date the administrator issues an initial determination order under division (B) of section
4123.511 of the Revised Code. If the claim is ultimately disallowed in a final administrative or
judicial order, and if the employer is a state fund employer who pays assessments into the surplus
fund account created under section 4123.34 of the Revised Code, the payments for medical services
made pursuant to this division for the first fill of prescription drugs shall be charged to and paid from
the surplus fund account and not charged through the state insurance fund to the employer against
whom the claim was filed.
(C)(1) If an employer or a welfare plan has provided to or on behalf of an employee any
benefits or compensation for an injury or occupational disease and that injury or occupational
disease is determined compensable under this chapter, the employer or a welfare plan may request
that the administrator reimburse the employer or welfare plan for the amount the employer or
welfare plan paid to or on behalf of the employee in compensation or benefits. The administrator
shall reimburse the employer or welfare plan for the compensation and benefits paid if, at the time
the employer or welfare plan provides the benefits or compensation to or on behalf of employee, the
injury or occupational disease had not been determined to be compensable under this chapter and if
the employee was not receiving compensation or benefits under this chapter for that injury or
occupational disease. The administrator shall reimburse the employer or welfare plan in the amount

Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
29
that the administrator would have paid to or on behalf of the employee under this chapter if the
injury or occupational disease originally would have been determined compensable under this
chapter. If the employer is a merit-rated employer, the administrator shall adjust the amount of
premium next due from the employer according to the amount the administrator pays the employer.
The administrator shall adopt rules, in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code, to
implement this division.

(3) Any payment made pursuant to this division shall be charged to and paid from the
surplus fund account created under section 4123.34 of the Revised Code.

recovering sums greater than five hundred dollars.
(5) The administrator may adopt rules, with the advice and consent of the bureau of workers'
compensation board of directors, to implement this division.

Am. H. B. No. 81 136th G.A.
35
employment while en route to the premises to be inspected or investigated, and that violation

mechanisms provided in this section to correct or remove the condition or practice.
(4) If, during an inspection or investigation, the administrator or the administrator's designee

a citation a public employee or public employee representative files notice that the time period fixed
in the citation for the abatement of the violation is unreasonable, the administrator shall hold an
adjudication hearing in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code.
(H) In establishing the time limits in which a public employer must abate a violation under
this section, the administrator shall consider the costs to the public employer, the size and financial
resources of the public employer, the severity of the violation, the technological feasibility of the
public employer's ability to comply with requirements of the citation, the possible present and future
detriment to the health and safety of any public employee for failure of the public employer to
comply with requirements of the citation, and such other factors as the administrator determines
appropriate. The administrator may, after considering the above factors, permit the public employer
to comply with the citation over a period of up to two years and may extend that period an additional
one year, as the administrator determines appropriate.
(I) Any public employer may request the administrator to conduct an employment risk
reduction inspection of the public employer's place of employment. The administrator or the
administrator's designee shall conduct the inspection within a reasonable amount of time following
the request. Neither the administrator nor any other person may use any information obtained from

or any rule or order issued thereunder nor in any other action in any court in this state.
