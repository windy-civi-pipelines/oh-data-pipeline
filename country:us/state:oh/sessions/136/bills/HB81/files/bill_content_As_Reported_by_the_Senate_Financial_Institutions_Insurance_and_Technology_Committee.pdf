nonfeasance in office, or conviction of a felony while employed 408
in the civil service. An employee also forfeits the right to 409
resume a position in the classified service upon transfer to a 410
different agency. 411
Reinstatement to a position in the classified service 412
shall be to a position substantially equal to that position in 413
the classified service held previously, as certified by the 414
department of administrative services. If the position the 415
person previously held in the classified service has been placed 416
in the unclassified service or is otherwise unavailable, the 417
person shall be appointed to a position in the classified 418
service within the bureau that the director of administrative 419
services certifies is comparable in compensation to the position 420
the person previously held in the classified service. Service in 421
the position in the unclassified service shall be counted as 422

the compensation for loss sustained on account of the injury, 867
occupational disease, or death, and the medical, nurse, and 868
hospital services and medicines, and the amount of funeral 869
expenses in case of death, as are provided by this chapter. The 870
compensation and benefits shall be provided, as applicable, 871
directly from the employee's self-insuring employer as provided 872
in section 4123.35 of the Revised Code or from the state 873
insurance fund. An employee or dependent is not entitled to 874

following: 877
(1) Purposely self-inflicted; 878
(2) Caused by the employee being intoxicated, under the 879
influence of a controlled substance not prescribed by a 880
physician, certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse specialist, 881
or certified nurse practitioner, or under the influence of 882
marihuana if being intoxicated, under the influence of a 883
controlled substance not prescribed by a physician, certified 884
nurse-midwife, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse 885
practitioner, or under the influence of marihuana was the 886
proximate cause of the injury. 887
(B) For the purpose of this section, provided that an 888
employer has posted written notice to employees that the results 889
of, or the employee's refusal to submit to, any chemical test 890
described under this division may affect the employee's 891
eligibility for compensation and benefits pursuant to this 892
chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code, there is a 893
rebuttable presumption that an employee is intoxicated, under 894
the influence of a controlled substance not prescribed by the 895
employee's physician, certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse 896
specialist, or certified nurse practitioner, or under the 897
influence of marihuana and that being intoxicated, under the 898
influence of a controlled substance not prescribed by the 899
employee's physician, certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse 900
specialist, or certified nurse practitioner, or under the 901
influence of marihuana is the proximate cause of an injury under 902
either of the following conditions: 903
(1) When any one or more of the following is true: 904
(a) The employee, through a qualifying chemical test 905

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 32
As Reported by the Senate Financial Institutions, Insurance and Technology Committee
administered within eight hours of an injury, is determined to 906
have an alcohol concentration level equal to or in excess of the 907
levels established in divisions (A)(1)(b) to (i) of section 908
4511.19 of the Revised Code. 909
(b) The employee, through a qualifying chemical test 910
administered within thirty-two hours of an injury, is determined 911
to have a controlled substance not prescribed by the employee's 912
physician, certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse specialist, 913
or certified nurse practitioner or marihuana in the employee's 914
system at a level equal to or in excess of the cutoff 915
concentration level for the particular substance as provided in 916
section 40.87 40.85 of Title 49 of the Code of Federal 917
Regulations, 49 C.F.R. 40.8740.85, as amendedit existed on 918
January 1, 2024, or as subsequently amended as a result of a 919
statute or rule. 920
(c) The employee, through a qualifying chemical test 921
administered within thirty-two hours of an injury, is determined 922
to have barbiturates, benzodiazepines, or methadone in the 923
employee's system that tests above levels established by 924
laboratories certified by the United States department of health 925
and human services. 926
(2) When the employee refuses to submit to a requested 927
chemical test, on the condition that that employee is or was 928
given notice that the refusal to submit to any chemical test 929
described in division (B)(1) of this section may affect the 930
employee's eligibility for compensation and benefits under this 931
chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code. 932
(C)(1) For purposes of division (B) of this section, a 933
chemical test is a qualifying chemical test if it is 934
administered to an employee after an injury under at least one 935

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 33
As Reported by the Senate Financial Institutions, Insurance and Technology Committee
of the following conditions: 936
(a) When the employee's employer had reasonable cause to 937
suspect that the employee may be intoxicated, under the 938
influence of a controlled substance not prescribed by the 939
employee's physician, certified nurse-midwife, clinical nurse 940
specialist, or certified nurse practitioner, or under the 941
influence of marihuana; 942
(b) At the request of a police officer pursuant to section 943
4511.191 of the Revised Code, and not at the request of the 944
employee's employer; 945
(c) At the request of a licensed physician, certified 946
nurse-midwife, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse 947
practitioner who is not employed by the employee's employer, and 948
not at the request of the employee's employer. 949
(2) As used in division (C)(1)(a) of this section, 950
"reasonable cause" means, but is not limited to, evidence that 951
an employee is or was using alcohol, a controlled substance, or 952
marihuana drawn from specific, objective facts and reasonable 953
inferences drawn from these facts in light of experience and 954
training. These facts and inferences may be based on, but are 955
not limited to, any of the following: 956
(a) Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of 957
use, possession, or distribution of alcohol, a controlled 958
substance, or marihuana, or of the physical symptoms of being 959
under the influence of alcohol, a controlled substance, or 960
marihuana, such as but not limited to slurred speech; dilated 961
pupils; odor of alcohol, a controlled substance, or marihuana; 962
changes in affect; or dynamic mood swings; 963
(b) A pattern of abnormal conduct, erratic or aberrant 964

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 34
As Reported by the Senate Financial Institutions, Insurance and Technology Committee
behavior, or deteriorating work performance such as frequent 965
absenteeism, excessive tardiness, or recurrent accidents, that 966
appears to be related to the use of alcohol, a controlled 967
substance, or marihuana, and does not appear to be attributable 968
to other factors; 969
(c) The identification of an employee as the focus of a 970
criminal investigation into unauthorized possession, use, or 971
trafficking of a controlled substance or marihuana; 972
(d) A report of use of alcohol, a controlled substance, or 973
marihuana provided by a reliable and credible source; 974
(e) Repeated or flagrant violations of the safety or work 975
rules of the employee's employer, that are determined by the 976
employee's supervisor to pose a substantial risk of physical 977
injury or property damage and that appear to be related to the 978
use of alcohol, a controlled substance, or marihuana and that do 979
not appear attributable to other factors. 980
(D) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect 981
the rights of an employer to test employees for alcohol or 982
controlled substance abuse. 983
(E) For the purpose of this section, laboratories 984
certified by the United States department of health and human 985
services or laboratories that meet or exceed the standards of 986
that department for laboratory certification shall be used for 987
processing the test results of a qualifying chemical test. 988
(F) The written notice required by division (B) of this 989
section shall be the same size or larger than the proof of 990
workers' compensation coverage furnished by the bureau of 991
workers' compensation and shall be posted by the employer in the 992
same location as the proof of workers' compensation coverage or 993

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 35
As Reported by the Senate Financial Institutions, Insurance and Technology Committee
the certificate of self-insurance. 994
(G) If a condition that pre-existed an injury is 995
substantially aggravated by the injury, and that substantial 996
aggravation is documented by objective diagnostic findings, 997
objective clinical findings, or objective test results, no 998
compensation or benefits are payable because of the pre-existing 999
condition once that condition has returned to a level that would 1000
have existed without the injury. 1001
(H)(1) Whenever, with respect to an employee of an 1002
employer who is subject to and has complied with this chapter, 1003
there is possibility of conflict with respect to the application 1004
of workers' compensation laws because the contract of employment 1005
is entered into and all or some portion of the work is or is to 1006
be performed in a state or states other than Ohio, the employer 1007
and the employee may agree to be bound by the laws of this state 1008
or by the laws of some other state in which all or some portion 1009
of the work of the employee is to be performed. The agreement 1010
shall be in writing and shall be filed with the bureau of 1011
workers' compensation within ten days after it is executed and 1012
shall remain in force until terminated or modified by agreement 1013
of the parties similarly filed. If the agreement is to be bound 1014
by the laws of this state and the employer has complied with 1015
this chapter, then the employee is entitled to compensation and 1016
benefits regardless of where the injury occurs or the disease is 1017
contracted and the rights of the employee and the employee's 1018
dependents under the laws of this state are the exclusive remedy 1019
against the employer on account of injury, disease, or death in 1020
the course of and arising out of the employee's employment. If 1021
the agreement is to be bound by the laws of another state and 1022
the employer has complied with the laws of that state, the 1023
rights of the employee and the employee's dependents under the 1024

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 36
As Reported by the Senate Financial Institutions, Insurance and Technology Committee
laws of that state are the exclusive remedy against the employer 1025
on account of injury, disease, or death in the course of and 1026
arising out of the employee's employment without regard to the 1027
place where the injury was sustained or the disease contracted. 1028
If an employer and an employee enter into an agreement under 1029
this division, the fact that the employer and the employee 1030
entered into that agreement shall not be construed to change the 1031
status of an employee whose continued employment is subject to 1032
the will of the employer or the employee, unless the agreement 1033
contains a provision that expressly changes that status. 1034
(2) If an employee or the employee's dependents receive an 1035
award of compensation or benefits under this chapter or Chapter 1036
4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for the same injury, 1037
occupational disease, or death for which the employee or the 1038
employee's dependents previously pursued or otherwise elected to 1039
accept workers' compensation benefits and received a decision on 1040
the merits as defined in section 4123.542 of the Revised Code 1041
under the laws of another state or recovered damages under the 1042
laws of another state, the claim shall be disallowed and the 1043
administrator or any self-insuring employer, by any lawful 1044
means, may collect from the employee or the employee's 1045
dependents any of the following: 1046
(a) The amount of compensation or benefits paid to or on 1047
behalf of the employee or the employee's dependents by the 1048
administrator or a self-insuring employer pursuant to this 1049
chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code 1050
for that award; 1051
(b) Any interest, attorney's fees, and costs the 1052
administrator or the self-insuring employer incurs in collecting 1053
that payment. 1054

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 37
As Reported by the Senate Financial Institutions, Insurance and Technology Committee
(3) If an employee or the employee's dependents receive an 1055
award of compensation or benefits under this chapter or Chapter 1056
4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code and subsequently 1057
pursue or otherwise elect to accept workers' compensation 1058
benefits or damages under the laws of another state for the same 1059
injury, occupational disease, or death the claim under this 1060
chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code 1061
shall be disallowed. The administrator or a self-insuring 1062
employer, by any lawful means, may collect from the employee or 1063
the employee's dependents or other-states' insurer any of the 1064
following: 1065
(a) The amount of compensation or benefits paid to or on 1066
behalf of the employee or the employee's dependents by the 1067
administrator or the self-insuring employer pursuant to this 1068
chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code 1069
for that award; 1070
(b) Any interest, costs, and attorney's fees the 1071
administrator or the self-insuring employer incurs in collecting 1072
that payment; 1073
(c) Any costs incurred by an employer in contesting or 1074
responding to any claim filed by the employee or the employee's 1075
dependents for the same injury, occupational disease, or death 1076
that was filed after the original claim for which the employee 1077
or the employee's dependents received a decision on the merits 1078
as described in section 4123.542 of the Revised Code. 1079
(4) If the employee's employer pays premiums into the 1080
state insurance fund, the administrator shall not charge the 1081
amount of compensation or benefits the administrator collects 1082
pursuant to division (H)(2) or (3) of this section to the 1083
employer's experience. If the administrator collects any costs 1084

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 38
As Reported by the Senate Financial Institutions, Insurance and Technology Committee
incurred by an employer in contesting or responding to any claim 1085
pursuant to division (H)(2) or (3) of this section, the 1086
administrator shall forward the amount collected to that 1087
employer. If the employee's employer is a self-insuring 1088
employer, the self-insuring employer shall deduct the amount of 1089
compensation or benefits the self-insuring employer collects 1090
pursuant to this division from the paid compensation the self- 1091
insuring employer reports to the administrator under division 1092
(L) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code. 1093
(5) If an employee is a resident of a state other than 1094
this state and is insured under the workers' compensation law or 1095
similar laws of a state other than this state, the employee and 1096
the employee's dependents are not entitled to receive 1097
compensation or benefits under this chapter, on account of 1098
injury, disease, or death arising out of or in the course of 1099
employment while temporarily within this state, and the rights 1100
of the employee and the employee's dependents under the laws of 1101
the other state are the exclusive remedy against the employer on 1102
account of the injury, disease, or death. 1103
(6) An employee, or the dependent of an employee, who 1104
elects to receive compensation and benefits under this chapter 1105
or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for a 1106
claim may not receive compensation and benefits under the 1107
workers' compensation laws of any state other than this state 1108
for that same claim. For each claim submitted by or on behalf of 1109
an employee, the administrator or, if the employee is employed 1110
by a self-insuring employer, the self-insuring employer, shall 1111
request the employee or the employee's dependent to sign an 1112
election that affirms the employee's or employee's dependent's 1113
acceptance of electing to receive compensation and benefits 1114
under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the 1115

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 39
As Reported by the Senate Financial Institutions, Insurance and Technology Committee
Revised Code for that claim that also affirmatively waives and 1116
releases the employee's or the employee's dependent's right to 1117
file for and receive compensation and benefits under the laws of 1118
any state other than this state for that claim. The employee or 1119
employee's dependent shall sign the election form within twenty- 1120
eight days after the administrator or self-insuring employer 1121
submits the request or the administrator or self-insuring 1122
employer shall dismiss that claim. 1123
In the event a workers' compensation claim has been filed 1124
in another jurisdiction on behalf of an employee or the 1125
dependents of an employee, and the employee or dependents 1126
subsequently elect to receive compensation, benefits, or both 1127
under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the 1128
Revised Code, the employee or dependent shall withdraw or refuse 1129
acceptance of the workers' compensation claim filed in the other 1130
jurisdiction in order to pursue compensation or benefits under 1131
the laws of this state. If the employee or dependents were 1132
awarded workers' compensation benefits or had recovered damages 1133
under the laws of the other state, any compensation and benefits 1134
awarded under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of 1135
the Revised Code shall be paid only to the extent to which those 1136
payments exceed the amounts paid under the laws of the other 1137
state. If the employee or dependent fails to withdraw or to 1138
refuse acceptance of the workers' compensation claim in the 1139
other jurisdiction within twenty-eight days after a request made 1140
by the administrator or a self-insuring employer, the 1141
administrator or self-insuring employer shall dismiss the 1142
employee's or employee's dependents' claim made in this state. 1143
(I) If an employee who is covered under the federal 1144
"Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act," 98 Stat. 1639, 1145
33 U.S.C. 901 et seq., is injured or contracts an occupational 1146

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 40
As Reported by the Senate Financial Institutions, Insurance and Technology Committee
disease or dies as a result of an injury or occupational 1147
disease, and if that employee's or that employee's dependents' 1148
claim for compensation or benefits for that injury, occupational 1149
disease, or death is subject to the jurisdiction of that act, 1150
the employee or the employee's dependents are not entitled to 1151
apply for and shall not receive compensation or benefits under 1152
this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code. The rights 1153
of such an employee and the employee's dependents under the 1154
federal "Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act," 98 1155
Stat. 1639, 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq., are the exclusive remedy 1156
against the employer for that injury, occupational disease, or 1157
death. 1158
(J) Compensation or benefits are not payable to a claimant 1159
or a dependent during the period of confinement of the claimant 1160
or dependent in any state or federal correctional institution, 1161
or in any county jail in lieu of incarceration in a state or 1162
federal correctional institution, whether in this or any other 1163
state for conviction of violation of any state or federal 1164
criminal law. 1165
(K) An employer, upon the approval of the administrator, 1166
may provide for workers' compensation coverage for the 1167
employer's employees who are professional athletes and coaches 1168
by submitting to the administrator proof of coverage under a 1169
league policy issued under the laws of another state under 1170
either of the following circumstances: 1171
(1) The employer administers the payroll and workers' 1172
compensation insurance for a professional sports team subject to 1173
a collective bargaining agreement, and the collective bargaining 1174
agreement provides for the uniform administration of workers' 1175
compensation benefits and compensation for professional 1176

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 41
As Reported by the Senate Financial Institutions, Insurance and Technology Committee
athletes. 1177
(2) The employer is a professional sports league, or is a 1178
member team of a professional sports league, and all of the 1179
following apply: 1180
(a) The professional sports league operates as a single 1181
entity, whereby all of the players and coaches of the sports 1182
league are employees of the sports league and not of the 1183
individual member teams. 1184
(b) The professional sports league at all times maintains 1185
workers' compensation insurance that provides coverage for the 1186
players and coaches of the sports league. 1187
(c) Each individual member team of the professional sports 1188
league, pursuant to the organizational or operating documents of 1189
the sports league, is obligated to the sports league to pay to 1190
the sports league any workers' compensation claims that are not 1191
covered by the workers' compensation insurance maintained by the 1192
sports league. 1193
If the administrator approves the employer's proof of 1194
coverage submitted under division (K) of this section, a 1195
professional athlete or coach who is an employee of the employer 1196
and the dependents of the professional athlete or coach are not 1197
entitled to apply for and shall not receive compensation or 1198
benefits under this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised 1199
Code. The rights of such an athlete or coach and the dependents 1200
of such an athlete or coach under the laws of the state where 1201
the policy was issued are the exclusive remedy against the 1202
employer for the athlete or coach if the athlete or coach 1203
suffers an injury or contracts an occupational disease in the 1204
course of employment, or for the dependents of the athlete or 1205

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 42
As Reported by the Senate Financial Institutions, Insurance and Technology Committee
the coach if the athlete or coach is killed as a result of an 1206
injury or dies as a result of an occupational disease, 1207
regardless of the location where the injury was suffered or the 1208
occupational disease was contracted. 1209
Sec. 4123.57. Partial disability compensation shall be 1210
paid as follows. 1211
Except as provided in this section, not earlier than 1212
twenty-six weeks after the date of termination of the latest 1213
period of payments under section 4123.56 of the Revised Code or 1214
twenty-six weeks after the termination of wages in lieu of those 1215
payments, or not earlier than twenty-six weeks after the date of 1216
the injury or contraction of an occupational disease in the 1217
absence of payments under section 4123.56 of the Revised Code or 1218
wages in lieu of those payments, the employee may file an 1219
application with the bureau of workers' compensation for the 1220
determination of the percentage of the employee's permanent 1221
partial disability resulting from an injury or occupational 1222
disease. 1223
Whenever the application is filed, the bureau shall send a 1224
copy of the application to the employee's employer or the 1225
employer's representative and shall schedule the employee for a 1226
medical examination by the bureau medical section. The bureau 1227
shall send a copy of the report of the medical examination to 1228
the employee, the employer, and their representatives. 1229
Thereafter, the administrator of workers' compensation shall 1230
review the employee's claim file and make a tentative order as 1231
the evidence before the administrator at the time of the making 1232
of the order warrants. If the administrator determines that 1233
there is a conflict of evidence, the administrator shall send 1234
the application, along with the claimant's file, to the district 1235

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 43
As Reported by the Senate Financial Institutions, Insurance and Technology Committee
hearing officer who shall set the application for a hearing. 1236
If an employee fails to respond to an attempt to schedule 1237
a medical examination by the bureau medical section, or fails to 1238
attend a medical examination scheduled under this section 1239
without notice or explanation, the employee's application for a 1240
finding shall be dismissed without prejudice. The employee may 1241
refile the application. A dismissed application does not toll 1242
the continuing jurisdiction of the industrial commission under 1243
section 4123.52 of the Revised Code. The administrator shall 1244
adopt rules addressing the manner in which an employee will be 1245
notified of a possible dismissal and how an employee may refile 1246
an application for a determination. 1247
The administrator shall notify the employee, the employer, 1248
and their representatives, in writing, of the tentative order 1249
and of the parties' right to request a hearing. Unless the 1250
employee, the employer, or their representative notifies the 1251
administrator, in writing, of an objection to the tentative 1252
order within twenty days after receipt of the notice thereof, 1253
the tentative order shall go into effect and the employee shall 1254
receive the compensation provided in the order. In no event 1255
shall there be a reconsideration of a tentative order issued 1256
under this division. 1257
If the employee, the employer, or their representatives 1258
timely notify the administrator of an objection to the tentative 1259
order, the matter shall be referred to a district hearing 1260
officer who shall set the application for hearing with written 1261
notices to all interested persons. Upon referral to a district 1262
hearing officer, the employer may obtain a medical examination 1263
of the employee, pursuant to rules of the industrial commission. 1264
(A) The district hearing officer, upon the application, 1265

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 44
As Reported by the Senate Financial Institutions, Insurance and Technology Committee
shall determine the percentage of the employee's permanent 1266
disability, except as is subject to division (B) of this 1267
section, based upon that condition of the employee resulting 1268
from the injury or occupational disease and causing permanent 1269
impairment evidenced by medical or clinical findings reasonably 1270
demonstrable. The employee shall receive sixty-six and two- 1271
thirds per cent of the employee's average weekly wage, but not 1272
more than a maximum of thirty-three and one-third per cent of 1273
the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of 1274
section 4123.62 of the Revised Code, per week regardless of the 1275
average weekly wage, for the number of weeks which equals the 1276
percentage of two hundred weeks. Except on application for 1277
reconsideration, review, or modification, which is filed within 1278
ten days after the date of receipt of the decision of the 1279
district hearing officer, in no instance shall the former award 1280
be modified unless it is found from medical or clinical findings 1281
that the condition of the claimant resulting from the injury has 1282
so progressed as to have increased the percentage of permanent 1283
partial disability. A staff hearing officer shall hear an 1284
application for reconsideration filed and the staff hearing 1285
officer's decision is final. An employee may file an application 1286
for a subsequent determination of the percentage of the 1287
employee's permanent disability. If such an application is 1288
filed, the bureau shall send a copy of the application to the 1289
employer or the employer's representative. No sooner than sixty 1290
days from the date of the mailing of the application to the 1291
employer or the employer's representative, the administrator 1292
shall review the application. The administrator may require a 1293
medical examination or medical review of the employee. The 1294
administrator shall issue a tentative order based upon the 1295
evidence before the administrator, provided that if the 1296
administrator requires a medical examination or medical review, 1297

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 45
As Reported by the Senate Financial Institutions, Insurance and Technology Committee
the administrator shall not issue the tentative order until the 1298
completion of the examination or review. 1299
The employer may obtain a medical examination of the 1300
employee and may submit medical evidence at any stage of the 1301
process up to a hearing before the district hearing officer, 1302
pursuant to rules of the commission. The administrator shall 1303
notify the employee, the employer, and their representatives, in 1304
writing, of the nature and amount of any tentative order issued 1305
on an application requesting a subsequent determination of the 1306
percentage of an employee's permanent disability. An employee, 1307
employer, or their representatives may object to the tentative 1308
order within twenty days after the receipt of the notice 1309
thereof. If no timely objection is made, the tentative order 1310
shall go into effect. In no event shall there be a 1311
reconsideration of a tentative order issued under this division. 1312
If an objection is timely made, the application for a subsequent 1313
determination shall be referred to a district hearing officer 1314
who shall set the application for a hearing with written notice 1315
to all interested persons. No application for subsequent 1316
percentage determinations on the same claim for injury or 1317
occupational disease shall be accepted for review by the 1318
district hearing officer unless supported by substantial 1319
evidence of new and changed circumstances developing since the 1320
time of the hearing on the original or last determination. 1321
No award shall be made under this division based upon a 1322
percentage of disability which, when taken with all other 1323
percentages of permanent disability, exceeds one hundred per 1324
cent. If the percentage of the permanent disability of the 1325
employee equals or exceeds ninety per cent, compensation for 1326
permanent partial disability shall be paid for two hundred 1327
weeks. 1328

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 46

Compensation payable under this division accrues and is 1329
payable to the employee from the date of last payment of 1330
compensation, or, in cases where no previous compensation has 1331
been paid, from the date of the injury or the date of the 1332
diagnosis of the occupational disease. 1333
When an award under this division has been made prior to 1334
the death of an employee, all unpaid installments accrued or to 1335
accrue under the provisions of the award are payable to the 1336
surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse, to the 1337
dependent children of the employee, and if there are no children 1338
surviving, then to other dependents as the administrator 1339
determines. 1340
(B) For purposes of this division, "payable per week" 1341
means the seven-consecutive-day period in which compensation is 1342
paid in installments according to the schedule associated with 1343
the applicable injury as set forth in this division. 1344
Compensation paid in weekly installments according to the 1345
schedule described in this division may only be commuted to one 1346
or more lump sum payments pursuant to the procedure set forth in 1347
section 4123.64 of the Revised Code. 1348
In cases included in the following schedule the 1349
compensation payable per week to the employee is the statewide 1350
average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 1351
4123.62 of the Revised Code per week and shall be paid in 1352
installments according to the following schedule: 1353
For the loss of a first finger, commonly known as a thumb, 1354
sixty weeks. 1355
For the loss of a second finger, commonly called index 1356
finger, thirty-five weeks. 1357

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 47
As Reported by the Senate Financial Institutions, Insurance and Technology Committee
For the loss of a third finger, thirty weeks. 1358
For the loss of a fourth finger, twenty weeks. 1359
For the loss of a fifth finger, commonly known as the 1360
little finger, fifteen weeks. 1361
The loss of a second, or distal, phalange of the thumb is 1362
considered equal to the loss of one half of such thumb; the loss 1363
of more than one half of such thumb is considered equal to the 1364
loss of the whole thumb. 1365
The loss of the third, or distal, phalange of any finger 1366
is considered equal to the loss of one-third of the finger. 1367
The loss of the middle, or second, phalange of any finger 1368
is considered equal to the loss of two-thirds of the finger. 1369
The loss of more than the middle and distal phalanges of 1370
any finger is considered equal to the loss of the whole finger. 1371
In no case shall the amount received for more than one finger 1372
exceed the amount provided in this schedule for the loss of a 1373
hand. 1374
For the loss of the metacarpal bone (bones of the palm) 1375
for the corresponding thumb, or fingers, add ten weeks to the 1376
number of weeks under this division. 1377
For ankylosis (total stiffness of) or contractures (due to 1378
scars or injuries) which makes any of the fingers, thumbs, or 1379
parts of either useless, the same number of weeks apply to the 1380
members or parts thereof as given for the loss thereof. 1381
If the claimant has suffered the loss of two or more 1382
fingers by amputation or ankylosis and the nature of the 1383
claimant's employment in the course of which the claimant was 1384
working at the time of the injury or occupational disease is 1385

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 48
As Reported by the Senate Financial Institutions, Insurance and Technology Committee
such that the impairment or disability resulting from the loss 1386
of fingers, or loss of use of fingers, exceeds the normal 1387
impairment or disability resulting from the loss of fingers, or 1388
loss of use of fingers, the administrator may take that fact 1389
into consideration and increase the award of compensation 1390
accordingly, but the award made shall not exceed the amount of 1391
compensation for loss of a hand. 1392
For the loss of a hand, one hundred seventy-five weeks. 1393
For the loss of an arm, two hundred twenty-five weeks. 1394
For the loss of a great toe, thirty weeks. 1395
For the loss of one of the toes other than the great toe, 1396
ten weeks. 1397
The loss of more than two-thirds of any toe is considered 1398
equal to the loss of the whole toe. 1399
The loss of less than two-thirds of any toe is considered 1400
no loss, except as to the great toe; the loss of the great toe 1401
up to the interphalangeal joint is co-equal to the loss of one- 1402
half of the great toe; the loss of the great toe beyond the 1403
interphalangeal joint is considered equal to the loss of the 1404
whole great toe. 1405
For the loss of a foot, one hundred fifty weeks. 1406
For the loss of a leg, two hundred weeks. 1407
For the loss of the sight of an eye, one hundred twenty- 1408
five weeks. 1409
For the permanent partial loss of sight of an eye, the 1410
portion of one hundred twenty-five weeks as the administrator in 1411
each case determines, based upon the percentage of vision 1412

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 49
As Reported by the Senate Financial Institutions, Insurance and Technology Committee
actually lost as a result of the injury or occupational disease, 1413
but, in no case shall an award of compensation be made for less 1414
than twenty-five per cent loss of uncorrected vision. "Loss of 1415
uncorrected vision" means the percentage of vision actually lost 1416
as the result of the injury or occupational disease. 1417
For the permanent and total loss of hearing of one ear, 1418
twenty-five weeks; but in no case shall an award of compensation 1419
be made for less than permanent and total loss of hearing of one 1420
ear. 1421
For the permanent and total loss of hearing, one hundred 1422
twenty-five weeks; but, except pursuant to the next preceding 1423
paragraph, in no case shall an award of compensation be made for 1424
less than permanent and total loss of hearing. 1425
In case an injury or occupational disease results in 1426
serious facial or head disfigurement which either impairs or may 1427
in the future impair the opportunities to secure or retain 1428
employment, the administrator shall make an award of 1429
compensation as it deems proper and equitable, in view of the 1430
nature of the disfigurement, and not to exceed the sum of ten 1431
thousand dollars. For the purpose of making the award, it is not 1432
material whether the employee is gainfully employed in any 1433
occupation or trade at the time of the administrator's 1434
determination. 1435
When an award under this division has been made prior to 1436
the death of an employee all unpaid installments accrued or to 1437
accrue under the provisions of the award shall be payable to the 1438
surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse, to the 1439
dependent children of the employee and if there are no such 1440
children, then to such dependents as the administrator 1441
determines. 1442

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 50
As Reported by the Senate Financial Institutions, Insurance and Technology Committee
When an employee has sustained the loss of a member by 1443
severance, but no award has been made on account thereof prior 1444
to the employee's death, the administrator shall make an award 1445
in accordance with this division for the loss which shall be 1446
payable to the surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving 1447
spouse, to the dependent children of the employee and if there 1448
are no such children, then to such dependents as the 1449
administrator determines. 1450
(C) Compensation for partial impairment under divisions 1451
(A) and (B) of this section is in addition to the compensation 1452
paid the employee pursuant to section 4123.56 of the Revised 1453
Code. A claimant may receive compensation under divisions (A) 1454
and (B) of this section. 1455
In all cases arising under division (B) of this section, 1456
if it is determined by any one of the following: (1) the amputee 1457
clinic at University hospital, Ohio state university; (2) the 1458
opportunities for Ohioans with disabilities agency; (3) an 1459
amputee clinic or prescribing physician approved by the 1460
administrator or the administrator's designee, that an injured 1461
or disabled employee is in need of an artificial appliance, or 1462
in need of a repair thereof, regardless of whether the appliance 1463
or its repair will be serviceable in the vocational 1464
rehabilitation of the injured employee, and regardless of 1465
whether the employee has returned to or can ever again return to 1466
any gainful employment, the bureau shall pay the cost of the 1467
artificial appliance or its repair out of the surplus created by 1468
division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code. 1469
Notwithstanding any provision in this division to the 1470
contrary, when a claimant has sustained an amputation or a loss 1471
enumerated in division (B) of this section as a result of an 1472

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 51
As Reported by the Senate Financial Institutions, Insurance and Technology Committee
injury or occupational disease, the administrator shall pay the 1473
cost to purchase, repair, or replace a prosthetic device as 1474
defined in division (B) of section 4123.52 from the surplus fund 1475
account created pursuant to division (B) of section 4123.34 of 1476
the Revised Code, even if no award has been made under division 1477
(B) of this section. 1478
In those cases where an opportunities for Ohioans with 1479
disabilities agency's recommendation that an injured or disabled 1480
employee is in need of an artificial appliance would conflict 1481
with their state plan, adopted pursuant to the "Rehabilitation 1482
Act of 1973," 87 Stat. 355, 29 U.S.C.A. 701, the administrator 1483
or the administrator's designee or the bureau may obtain a 1484
recommendation from an amputee clinic or prescribing physician 1485
that they determine appropriate. 1486
(D) If an employee of a state fund employer makes 1487
application for a finding and the administrator finds that the 1488
employee has contracted silicosis as defined in division (Y), or 1489
coal miners' pneumoconiosis as defined in division (Z), or 1490
asbestosis as defined in division (BB) of section 4123.68 of the 1491
Revised Code, and that a change of such employee's occupation is 1492
medically advisable in order to decrease substantially further 1493
exposure to silica dust, asbestos, or coal dust and if the 1494
employee, after the finding, has changed or shall change the 1495
employee's occupation to an occupation in which the exposure to 1496
silica dust, asbestos, or coal dust is substantially decreased, 1497
the administrator shall allow to the employee an amount equal to 1498
fifty per cent of the statewide average weekly wage per week for 1499
a period of thirty weeks, commencing as of the date of the 1500
discontinuance or change, and for a period of one hundred weeks 1501
immediately following the expiration of the period of thirty 1502
weeks, the employee shall receive sixty-six and two-thirds per 1503

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 52
As Reported by the Senate Financial Institutions, Insurance and Technology Committee
cent of the loss of wages resulting directly and solely from the 1504
change of occupation but not to exceed a maximum of an amount 1505
equal to fifty per cent of the statewide average weekly wage per 1506
week. No such employee is entitled to receive more than one 1507
allowance on account of discontinuance of employment or change 1508
of occupation and benefits shall cease for any period during 1509
which the employee is employed in an occupation in which the 1510
exposure to silica dust, asbestos, or coal dust is not 1511
substantially less than the exposure in the occupation in which 1512
the employee was formerly employed or for any period during 1513
which the employee may be entitled to receive compensation or 1514
benefits under section 4123.68 of the Revised Code on account of 1515
disability from silicosis, asbestosis, or coal miners' 1516
pneumoconiosis. An award for change of occupation for a coal 1517
miner who has contracted coal miners' pneumoconiosis may be 1518
granted under this division even though the coal miner continues 1519
employment with the same employer, so long as the coal miner's 1520
employment subsequent to the change is such that the coal 1521
miner's exposure to coal dust is substantially decreased and a 1522
change of occupation is certified by the claimant as permanent. 1523
The administrator may accord to the employee medical and other 1524
benefits in accordance with section 4123.66 of the Revised Code. 1525
(E) If a firefighter or police officer makes application 1526
for a finding and the administrator finds that the firefighter 1527
or police officer has contracted a cardiovascular and pulmonary 1528
disease as defined in division (W) of section 4123.68 of the 1529
Revised Code, and that a change of the firefighter's or police 1530
officer's occupation is medically advisable in order to decrease 1531
substantially further exposure to smoke, toxic gases, chemical 1532
fumes, and other toxic vapors, and if the firefighter, or police 1533
officer, after the finding, has changed or changes occupation to 1534

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 53
As Reported by the Senate Financial Institutions, Insurance and Technology Committee
an occupation in which the exposure to smoke, toxic gases, 1535
chemical fumes, and other toxic vapors is substantially 1536
decreased, the administrator shall allow to the firefighter or 1537
police officer an amount equal to fifty per cent of the 1538
statewide average weekly wage per week for a period of thirty 1539
weeks, commencing as of the date of the discontinuance or 1540
change, and for a period of seventy-five weeks immediately 1541
following the expiration of the period of thirty weeks the 1542
administrator shall allow the firefighter or police officer 1543
sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the loss of wages resulting 1544
directly and solely from the change of occupation but not to 1545
exceed a maximum of an amount equal to fifty per cent of the 1546
statewide average weekly wage per week. No such firefighter or 1547
police officer is entitled to receive more than one allowance on 1548
account of discontinuance of employment or change of occupation 1549
and benefits shall cease for any period during which the 1550
firefighter or police officer is employed in an occupation in 1551
which the exposure to smoke, toxic gases, chemical fumes, and 1552
other toxic vapors is not substantially less than the exposure 1553
in the occupation in which the firefighter or police officer was 1554
formerly employed or for any period during which the firefighter 1555
or police officer may be entitled to receive compensation or 1556
benefits under section 4123.68 of the Revised Code on account of 1557
disability from a cardiovascular and pulmonary disease. The 1558
administrator may accord to the firefighter or police officer 1559
medical and other benefits in accordance with section 4123.66 of 1560
the Revised Code. 1561
(F) An order issued under this section is appealable 1562
pursuant to section 4123.511 of the Revised Code but is not 1563
appealable to court under section 4123.512 of the Revised Code. 1564
Sec. 4123.66. (A) In addition to the compensation provided 1565

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 54

administrator deems proper and, in case death ensues from the 1569
injury or occupational disease, the administrator shall disburse 1570
and pay from the fund reasonable funeral expenses in an amount 1571
not to exceed seven thousand five hundred dollars. The bureau of 1572
workers' compensation shall reimburse anyone, whether dependent, 1573
volunteer, or otherwise, who pays the funeral expenses of any 1574
employee whose death ensues from any injury or occupational 1575
disease as provided in this section. The administrator may adopt 1576
rules, with the advice and consent of the bureau of workers' 1577
compensation board of directors, with respect to furnishing 1578
medical, nurse, and hospital service and medicine to injured or 1579
disabled employees entitled thereto, and for the payment 1580
therefor. In case an injury or industrial accident that injures 1581
an employee also causes damage to the employee's eyeglasses, 1582
artificial teeth or other denture, or hearing aid, or in the 1583
event an injury or occupational disease makes it necessary or 1584
advisable to replace, repair, or adjust the same, the bureau 1585
shall disburse and pay a reasonable amount to repair or replace 1586
the same. 1587
(B) The administrator, in the rules the administrator 1588
adopts pursuant to division (A) of this section, may adopt rules 1589

medical conditions identified in an application for compensation 1592
or benefits under section 4123.84 or 4123.85 of the Revised Code 1593
that occurs prior to the date the administrator issues an 1594
initial determination order under division (B) of section 1595
4123.511 of the Revised Code. If the claim is ultimately 1596

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 55
As Reported by the Senate Financial Institutions, Insurance and Technology Committee
disallowed in a final administrative or judicial order, and if 1597
the employer is a state fund employer who pays assessments into 1598
the surplus fund account created under section 4123.34 of the 1599
Revised Code, the payments for medical services made pursuant to 1600
this division for the first fill of prescription drugs shall be 1601
charged to and paid from the surplus fund account and not 1602
charged through the state insurance fund to the employer against 1603
whom the claim was filed. 1604
(C)(1) If an employer or a welfare plan has provided to or 1605
on behalf of an employee any benefits or compensation for an 1606
injury or occupational disease and that injury or occupational 1607
disease is determined compensable under this chapter, the 1608
employer or a welfare plan may request that the administrator 1609
reimburse the employer or welfare plan for the amount the 1610
employer or welfare plan paid to or on behalf of the employee in 1611
compensation or benefits. The administrator shall reimburse the 1612
employer or welfare plan for the compensation and benefits paid 1613
if, at the time the employer or welfare plan provides the 1614
benefits or compensation to or on behalf of employee, the injury 1615
or occupational disease had not been determined to be 1616
compensable under this chapter and if the employee was not 1617
receiving compensation or benefits under this chapter for that 1618
injury or occupational disease. The administrator shall 1619
reimburse the employer or welfare plan in the amount that the 1620
administrator would have paid to or on behalf of the employee 1621
under this chapter if the injury or occupational disease 1622
originally would have been determined compensable under this 1623
chapter. If the employer is a merit-rated employer, the 1624
administrator shall adjust the amount of premium next due from 1625
the employer according to the amount the administrator pays the 1626
employer. The administrator shall adopt rules, in accordance 1627

cost of medical assistance paid on behalf of a medical 1644
assistance recipient. 1645

department, or any other entity with a lawful right to 1662
reimbursement from recovering sums greater than five hundred 1663
dollars. 1664
