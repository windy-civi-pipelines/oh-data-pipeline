When in the judgment of the administrator it is necessary 880
to provide available funds for the payment of compensation or 881
benefits under this chapter, the administrator may borrow money 882
from any available source and pledge as security a sufficient 883
amount of bonds or other securities in which the state insurance 884
fund is invested. The aggregate unpaid amount of loans existing 885
at any one time for money so borrowed shall not exceed ten 886
million dollars. The bonds or other securities so pledged as 887
security for such loans to the administrator shall be the sole 888
security for the payment of the principal and interest of any 889
such loan. The administrator shall not be personally liable for 890
the payment of the principal or the interest of any such loan. 891
No such loan shall be made for a longer period of time than one 892
year. Such loans may be renewed but no one renewal shall be for 893
a period in excess of one year. Such loans shall bear such rate 894
of interest as the administrator determines and in negotiating 895
the loans, the administrator shall endeavor to secure as 896
favorable interest rates and terms as circumstances will permit. 897
The treasurer of state may deliver to the person or 898
governmental agency making such loan, the bonds or other 899
securities which are to be pledged by the administrator as 900
security for such loan, upon receipt by the treasurer of state 901
of an order of the administrator authorizing such loan. Upon 902
payment of any such loan by the administrator, the bonds or 903
other securities pledged as security therefor shall be returned 904

insurance fund is invested as is reasonably necessary as 908
security for any certificates issued, or paid out, by the 909
treasurer of state upon any warrants drawn by the administrator. 910
The administrator may secure investment information 911
services, consulting services, and other like services to 912
facilitate investment of the surplus and reserve belonging to 913
the state insurance fund. The administrator shall pay the 914
expense of securing such services from the state insurance fund. 915
The board and administrator shall not take any action to 916
promote a policy under which the administrator makes investment 917
decisions with the primary purpose of influencing any social or 918

Sec. 4123.54. (A) Except as otherwise provided in this 1012
division or divisions (I) and (K) of this section, every 1013
employee, who is injured or who contracts an occupational 1014

laboratories certified by the United States department of health 1077
and human services. 1078
(2) When the employee refuses to submit to a requested 1079
chemical test, on the condition that that employee is or was 1080
given notice that the refusal to submit to any chemical test 1081
described in division (B)(1) of this section may affect the 1082
employee's eligibility for compensation and benefits under this 1083

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 38
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee

"reasonable cause" means, but is not limited to, evidence that 1103
an employee is or was using alcohol, a controlled substance, or 1104
marihuana drawn from specific, objective facts and reasonable 1105
inferences drawn from these facts in light of experience and 1106
training. These facts and inferences may be based on, but are 1107

substance, or marihuana, and does not appear to be attributable 1120
to other factors; 1121
(c) The identification of an employee as the focus of a 1122
criminal investigation into unauthorized possession, use, or 1123

use of alcohol, a controlled substance, or marihuana and that do 1131
not appear attributable to other factors. 1132
(D) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect 1133
the rights of an employer to test employees for alcohol or 1134
controlled substance abuse. 1135
(E) For the purpose of this section, laboratories 1136
certified by the United States department of health and human 1137
services or laboratories that meet or exceed the standards of 1138
that department for laboratory certification shall be used for 1139
processing the test results of a qualifying chemical test. 1140

Section 40:

workers' compensation coverage furnished by the bureau of 1143
workers' compensation and shall be posted by the employer in the 1144
same location as the proof of workers' compensation coverage or 1145
the certificate of self-insurance. 1146
(G) If a condition that pre-existed an injury is 1147
substantially aggravated by the injury, and that substantial 1148
aggravation is documented by objective diagnostic findings, 1149
objective clinical findings, or objective test results, no 1150
compensation or benefits are payable because of the pre-existing 1151
condition once that condition has returned to a level that would 1152
have existed without the injury. 1153
(H)(1) Whenever, with respect to an employee of an 1154
employer who is subject to and has complied with this chapter, 1155
there is possibility of conflict with respect to the application 1156
of workers' compensation laws because the contract of employment 1157
is entered into and all or some portion of the work is or is to 1158
be performed in a state or states other than Ohio, the employer 1159
and the employee may agree to be bound by the laws of this state 1160
or by the laws of some other state in which all or some portion 1161
of the work of the employee is to be performed. The agreement 1162
shall be in writing and shall be filed with the bureau of 1163
workers' compensation within ten days after it is executed and 1164
shall remain in force until terminated or modified by agreement 1165
of the parties similarly filed. If the agreement is to be bound 1166
by the laws of this state and the employer has complied with 1167
this chapter, then the employee is entitled to compensation and 1168
benefits regardless of where the injury occurs or the disease is 1169
contracted and the rights of the employee and the employee's 1170
dependents under the laws of this state are the exclusive remedy 1171
against the employer on account of injury, disease, or death in 1172
the course of and arising out of the employee's employment. If 1173
Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 41
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
the agreement is to be bound by the laws of another state and 1174
the employer has complied with the laws of that state, the 1175
rights of the employee and the employee's dependents under the 1176
laws of that state are the exclusive remedy against the employer 1177
on account of injury, disease, or death in the course of and 1178
arising out of the employee's employment without regard to the 1179
place where the injury was sustained or the disease contracted. 1180
If an employer and an employee enter into an agreement under 1181
this division, the fact that the employer and the employee 1182
entered into that agreement shall not be construed to change the 1183
status of an employee whose continued employment is subject to 1184
the will of the employer or the employee, unless the agreement 1185
contains a provision that expressly changes that status. 1186
(2) If an employee or the employee's dependents receive an 1187
award of compensation or benefits under this chapter or Chapter 1188

occupational disease, or death for which the employee or the 1190
employee's dependents previously pursued or otherwise elected to 1191
accept workers' compensation benefits and received a decision on 1192
the merits as defined in section 4123.542 of the Revised Code 1193
under the laws of another state or recovered damages under the 1194
laws of another state, the claim shall be disallowed and the 1195
administrator or any self-insuring employer, by any lawful 1196
means, may collect from the employee or the employee's 1197
dependents any of the following: 1198
(a) The amount of compensation or benefits paid to or on 1199
behalf of the employee or the employee's dependents by the 1200
administrator or a self-insuring employer pursuant to this 1201
chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code 1202
for that award; 1203

award of compensation or benefits under this chapter or Chapter 1208

Section 42:
4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code and subsequently 1209
pursue or otherwise elect to accept workers' compensation 1210
benefits or damages under the laws of another state for the same 1211
injury, occupational disease, or death the claim under this 1212
chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code 1213
shall be disallowed. The administrator or a self-insuring 1214
employer, by any lawful means, may collect from the employee or 1215
the employee's dependents or other-states' insurer any of the 1216
following: 1217
(a) The amount of compensation or benefits paid to or on 1218
behalf of the employee or the employee's dependents by the 1219
administrator or the self-insuring employer pursuant to this 1220
chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code 1221
for that award; 1222
(b) Any interest, costs, and attorney's fees the 1223
administrator or the self-insuring employer incurs in collecting 1224
that payment; 1225
(c) Any costs incurred by an employer in contesting or 1226
responding to any claim filed by the employee or the employee's 1227
dependents for the same injury, occupational disease, or death 1228
that was filed after the original claim for which the employee 1229
or the employee's dependents received a decision on the merits 1230
as described in section 4123.542 of the Revised Code. 1231
(4) If the employee's employer pays premiums into the 1232
Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 43

state insurance fund, the administrator shall not charge the 1233
amount of compensation or benefits the administrator collects 1234
pursuant to division (H)(2) or (3) of this section to the 1235
employer's experience. If the administrator collects any costs 1236
incurred by an employer in contesting or responding to any claim 1237
pursuant to division (H)(2) or (3) of this section, the 1238
administrator shall forward the amount collected to that 1239
employer. If the employee's employer is a self-insuring 1240
employer, the self-insuring employer shall deduct the amount of 1241
compensation or benefits the self-insuring employer collects 1242
pursuant to this division from the paid compensation the self- 1243
insuring employer reports to the administrator under division 1244
(L) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code. 1245
(5) If an employee is a resident of a state other than 1246
this state and is insured under the workers' compensation law or 1247
similar laws of a state other than this state, the employee and 1248
the employee's dependents are not entitled to receive 1249
compensation or benefits under this chapter, on account of 1250
injury, disease, or death arising out of or in the course of 1251
employment while temporarily within this state, and the rights 1252
of the employee and the employee's dependents under the laws of 1253
the other state are the exclusive remedy against the employer on 1254
account of the injury, disease, or death. 1255
(6) An employee, or the dependent of an employee, who 1256
elects to receive compensation and benefits under this chapter 1257
or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for a 1258
claim may not receive compensation and benefits under the 1259
workers' compensation laws of any state other than this state 1260
for that same claim. For each claim submitted by or on behalf of 1261
an employee, the administrator or, if the employee is employed 1262
by a self-insuring employer, the self-insuring employer, shall 1263
Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 44

request the employee or the employee's dependent to sign an 1264
election that affirms the employee's or employee's dependent's 1265
acceptance of electing to receive compensation and benefits 1266
under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the 1267
Revised Code for that claim that also affirmatively waives and 1268
releases the employee's or the employee's dependent's right to 1269
file for and receive compensation and benefits under the laws of 1270
any state other than this state for that claim. The employee or 1271
employee's dependent shall sign the election form within twenty- 1272
eight days after the administrator or self-insuring employer 1273
submits the request or the administrator or self-insuring 1274
employer shall dismiss that claim. 1275
In the event a workers' compensation claim has been filed 1276
in another jurisdiction on behalf of an employee or the 1277
dependents of an employee, and the employee or dependents 1278
subsequently elect to receive compensation, benefits, or both 1279
under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the 1280
Revised Code, the employee or dependent shall withdraw or refuse 1281
acceptance of the workers' compensation claim filed in the other 1282
jurisdiction in order to pursue compensation or benefits under 1283
the laws of this state. If the employee or dependents were 1284
awarded workers' compensation benefits or had recovered damages 1285
under the laws of the other state, any compensation and benefits 1286
awarded under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of 1287
the Revised Code shall be paid only to the extent to which those 1288
payments exceed the amounts paid under the laws of the other 1289
state. If the employee or dependent fails to withdraw or to 1290
refuse acceptance of the workers' compensation claim in the 1291
other jurisdiction within twenty-eight days after a request made 1292
by the administrator or a self-insuring employer, the 1293
administrator or self-insuring employer shall dismiss the 1294
Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 45
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
employee's or employee's dependents' claim made in this state. 1295
(I) If an employee who is covered under the federal 1296
"Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act," 98 Stat. 1639, 1297
33 U.S.C. 901 et seq., is injured or contracts an occupational 1298
disease or dies as a result of an injury or occupational 1299
disease, and if that employee's or that employee's dependents' 1300
claim for compensation or benefits for that injury, occupational 1301
disease, or death is subject to the jurisdiction of that act, 1302
the employee or the employee's dependents are not entitled to 1303
apply for and shall not receive compensation or benefits under 1304
this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code. The rights 1305
of such an employee and the employee's dependents under the 1306
federal "Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act," 98 1307
Stat. 1639, 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq., are the exclusive remedy 1308
against the employer for that injury, occupational disease, or 1309
death. 1310
(J) Compensation or benefits are not payable to a claimant 1311
or a dependent during the period of confinement of the claimant 1312
or dependent in any state or federal correctional institution, 1313
or in any county jail in lieu of incarceration in a state or 1314
federal correctional institution, whether in this or any other 1315
state for conviction of violation of any state or federal 1316
criminal law. 1317
(K) An employer, upon the approval of the administrator, 1318
may provide for workers' compensation coverage for the 1319
employer's employees who are professional athletes and coaches 1320
by submitting to the administrator proof of coverage under a 1321
league policy issued under the laws of another state under 1322
either of the following circumstances: 1323
(1) The employer administers the payroll and workers' 1324
Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 46
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
compensation insurance for a professional sports team subject to 1325
a collective bargaining agreement, and the collective bargaining 1326
agreement provides for the uniform administration of workers' 1327
compensation benefits and compensation for professional 1328
athletes. 1329
(2) The employer is a professional sports league, or is a 1330
member team of a professional sports league, and all of the 1331
following apply: 1332
(a) The professional sports league operates as a single 1333
entity, whereby all of the players and coaches of the sports 1334
league are employees of the sports league and not of the 1335
individual member teams. 1336
(b) The professional sports league at all times maintains 1337
workers' compensation insurance that provides coverage for the 1338
players and coaches of the sports league. 1339
(c) Each individual member team of the professional sports 1340
league, pursuant to the organizational or operating documents of 1341
the sports league, is obligated to the sports league to pay to 1342
the sports league any workers' compensation claims that are not 1343
covered by the workers' compensation insurance maintained by the 1344
sports league. 1345
If the administrator approves the employer's proof of 1346
coverage submitted under division (K) of this section, a 1347
professional athlete or coach who is an employee of the employer 1348
and the dependents of the professional athlete or coach are not 1349
entitled to apply for and shall not receive compensation or 1350
benefits under this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised 1351
Code. The rights of such an athlete or coach and the dependents 1352
of such an athlete or coach under the laws of the state where 1353
Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 47
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
the policy was issued are the exclusive remedy against the 1354
employer for the athlete or coach if the athlete or coach 1355
suffers an injury or contracts an occupational disease in the 1356
course of employment, or for the dependents of the athlete or 1357
the coach if the athlete or coach is killed as a result of an 1358
injury or dies as a result of an occupational disease, 1359
regardless of the location where the injury was suffered or the 1360
occupational disease was contracted. 1361
Sec. 4123.57. Partial disability compensation shall be 1362
paid as follows. 1363
Except as provided in this section, not earlier than 1364
twenty-six weeks after the date of termination of the latest 1365
period of payments under section 4123.56 of the Revised Code or 1366
twenty-six weeks after the termination of wages in lieu of those 1367
payments, or not earlier than twenty-six weeks after the date of 1368
the injury or contraction of an occupational disease in the 1369
absence of payments under section 4123.56 of the Revised Code or 1370
wages in lieu of those payments, the employee may file an 1371
application with the bureau of workers' compensation for the 1372
determination of the percentage of the employee's permanent 1373
partial disability resulting from an injury or occupational 1374
disease. 1375
Whenever the application is filed, the bureau shall send a 1376
copy of the application to the employee's employer or the 1377
employer's representative and shall schedule the employee for a 1378
medical examination by the bureau medical section. The bureau 1379
shall send a copy of the report of the medical examination to 1380
the employee, the employer, and their representatives. 1381
Thereafter, the administrator of workers' compensation shall 1382
review the employee's claim file and make a tentative order as 1383
Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 48
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
the evidence before the administrator at the time of the making 1384
of the order warrants. If the administrator determines that 1385
there is a conflict of evidence, the administrator shall send 1386
the application, along with the claimant's file, to the district 1387
hearing officer who shall set the application for a hearing. 1388
If an employee fails to respond to an attempt to schedule 1389
a medical examination by the bureau medical section, or fails to 1390
attend a medical examination scheduled under this section 1391
without notice or explanation, the employee's application for a 1392
finding shall be dismissed without prejudice. The employee may 1393
refile the application. A dismissed application does not toll 1394
the continuing jurisdiction of the industrial commission under 1395

Section 43:
section 4123.52 of the Revised Code. The administrator shall 1396
adopt rules addressing the manner in which an employee will be 1397
notified of a possible dismissal and how an employee may refile 1398
an application for a determination. 1399
The administrator shall notify the employee, the employer, 1400
and their representatives, in writing, of the tentative order 1401
and of the parties' right to request a hearing. Unless the 1402
employee, the employer, or their representative notifies the 1403
administrator, in writing, of an objection to the tentative 1404
order within twenty days after receipt of the notice thereof, 1405
the tentative order shall go into effect and the employee shall 1406
receive the compensation provided in the order. In no event 1407
shall there be a reconsideration of a tentative order issued 1408
under this division. 1409
If the employee, the employer, or their representatives 1410
timely notify the administrator of an objection to the tentative 1411
order, the matter shall be referred to a district hearing 1412
officer who shall set the application for hearing with written 1413
Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 49
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
notices to all interested persons. Upon referral to a district 1414
hearing officer, the employer may obtain a medical examination 1415
of the employee, pursuant to rules of the industrial commission. 1416
(A) The district hearing officer, upon the application, 1417
shall determine the percentage of the employee's permanent 1418
disability, except as is subject to division (B) of this 1419

Section 44:
section, based upon that condition of the employee resulting 1420
from the injury or occupational disease and causing permanent 1421
impairment evidenced by medical or clinical findings reasonably 1422
demonstrable. The employee shall receive sixty-six and two- 1423
thirds per cent of the employee's average weekly wage, but not 1424
more than a maximum of thirty-three and one-third per cent of 1425
the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of 1426

Section 45:
section 4123.62 of the Revised Code, per week regardless of the 1427
average weekly wage, for the number of weeks which equals the 1428
percentage of two hundred weeks. Except on application for 1429
reconsideration, review, or modification, which is filed within 1430
ten days after the date of receipt of the decision of the 1431
district hearing officer, in no instance shall the former award 1432
be modified unless it is found from medical or clinical findings 1433
that the condition of the claimant resulting from the injury has 1434
so progressed as to have increased the percentage of permanent 1435
partial disability. A staff hearing officer shall hear an 1436
application for reconsideration filed and the staff hearing 1437
officer's decision is final. An employee may file an application 1438
for a subsequent determination of the percentage of the 1439
employee's permanent disability. If such an application is 1440
filed, the bureau shall send a copy of the application to the 1441
employer or the employer's representative. No sooner than sixty 1442
days from the date of the mailing of the application to the 1443
employer or the employer's representative, the administrator 1444
Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 50
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
shall review the application. The administrator may require a 1445
medical examination or medical review of the employee. The 1446
administrator shall issue a tentative order based upon the 1447
evidence before the administrator, provided that if the 1448
administrator requires a medical examination or medical review, 1449
the administrator shall not issue the tentative order until the 1450
completion of the examination or review. 1451
The employer may obtain a medical examination of the 1452
employee and may submit medical evidence at any stage of the 1453
process up to a hearing before the district hearing officer, 1454
pursuant to rules of the commission. The administrator shall 1455
notify the employee, the employer, and their representatives, in 1456
writing, of the nature and amount of any tentative order issued 1457
on an application requesting a subsequent determination of the 1458
percentage of an employee's permanent disability. An employee, 1459
employer, or their representatives may object to the tentative 1460
order within twenty days after the receipt of the notice 1461
thereof. If no timely objection is made, the tentative order 1462
shall go into effect. In no event shall there be a 1463
reconsideration of a tentative order issued under this division. 1464
If an objection is timely made, the application for a subsequent 1465
determination shall be referred to a district hearing officer 1466
who shall set the application for a hearing with written notice 1467
to all interested persons. No application for subsequent 1468
percentage determinations on the same claim for injury or 1469
occupational disease shall be accepted for review by the 1470
district hearing officer unless supported by substantial 1471
evidence of new and changed circumstances developing since the 1472
time of the hearing on the original or last determination. 1473
No award shall be made under this division based upon a 1474
percentage of disability which, when taken with all other 1475
Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 51
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
percentages of permanent disability, exceeds one hundred per 1476
cent. If the percentage of the permanent disability of the 1477
employee equals or exceeds ninety per cent, compensation for 1478
permanent partial disability shall be paid for two hundred 1479
weeks. 1480
Compensation payable under this division accrues and is 1481
payable to the employee from the date of last payment of 1482
compensation, or, in cases where no previous compensation has 1483
been paid, from the date of the injury or the date of the 1484
diagnosis of the occupational disease. 1485
When an award under this division has been made prior to 1486
the death of an employee, all unpaid installments accrued or to 1487
accrue under the provisions of the award are payable to the 1488
surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse, to the 1489
dependent children of the employee, and if there are no children 1490
surviving, then to other dependents as the administrator 1491
determines. 1492
(B) For purposes of this division, "payable per week" 1493
means the seven-consecutive-day period in which compensation is 1494
paid in installments according to the schedule associated with 1495
the applicable injury as set forth in this division. 1496
Compensation paid in weekly installments according to the 1497
schedule described in this division may only be commuted to one 1498
or more lump sum payments pursuant to the procedure set forth in 1499

Section 46:
section 4123.64 of the Revised Code. 1500
In cases included in the following schedule the 1501
compensation payable per week to the employee is the statewide 1502
average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 1503

Section 47:
4123.62 of the Revised Code per week and shall be paid in 1504
Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 52
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
installments according to the following schedule: 1505
For the loss of a first finger, commonly known as a thumb, 1506
sixty weeks. 1507
For the loss of a second finger, commonly called index 1508
finger, thirty-five weeks. 1509
For the loss of a third finger, thirty weeks. 1510
For the loss of a fourth finger, twenty weeks. 1511
For the loss of a fifth finger, commonly known as the 1512
little finger, fifteen weeks. 1513
The loss of a second, or distal, phalange of the thumb is 1514
considered equal to the loss of one half of such thumb; the loss 1515
of more than one half of such thumb is considered equal to the 1516
loss of the whole thumb. 1517
The loss of the third, or distal, phalange of any finger 1518
is considered equal to the loss of one-third of the finger. 1519
The loss of the middle, or second, phalange of any finger 1520
is considered equal to the loss of two-thirds of the finger. 1521
The loss of more than the middle and distal phalanges of 1522
any finger is considered equal to the loss of the whole finger. 1523
In no case shall the amount received for more than one finger 1524
exceed the amount provided in this schedule for the loss of a 1525
hand. 1526
For the loss of the metacarpal bone (bones of the palm) 1527
for the corresponding thumb, or fingers, add ten weeks to the 1528
number of weeks under this division. 1529
For ankylosis (total stiffness of) or contractures (due to 1530
scars or injuries) which makes any of the fingers, thumbs, or 1531
Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 53
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
parts of either useless, the same number of weeks apply to the 1532
members or parts thereof as given for the loss thereof. 1533
If the claimant has suffered the loss of two or more 1534
fingers by amputation or ankylosis and the nature of the 1535
claimant's employment in the course of which the claimant was 1536
working at the time of the injury or occupational disease is 1537
such that the impairment or disability resulting from the loss 1538
of fingers, or loss of use of fingers, exceeds the normal 1539
impairment or disability resulting from the loss of fingers, or 1540
loss of use of fingers, the administrator may take that fact 1541
into consideration and increase the award of compensation 1542
accordingly, but the award made shall not exceed the amount of 1543
compensation for loss of a hand. 1544
For the loss of a hand, one hundred seventy-five weeks. 1545
For the loss of an arm, two hundred twenty-five weeks. 1546
For the loss of a great toe, thirty weeks. 1547
For the loss of one of the toes other than the great toe, 1548
ten weeks. 1549
The loss of more than two-thirds of any toe is considered 1550
equal to the loss of the whole toe. 1551
The loss of less than two-thirds of any toe is considered 1552
no loss, except as to the great toe; the loss of the great toe 1553
up to the interphalangeal joint is co-equal to the loss of one- 1554
half of the great toe; the loss of the great toe beyond the 1555
interphalangeal joint is considered equal to the loss of the 1556
whole great toe. 1557
For the loss of a foot, one hundred fifty weeks. 1558
For the loss of a leg, two hundred weeks. 1559
Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 54
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
For the loss of the sight of an eye, one hundred twenty- 1560
five weeks. 1561
For the permanent partial loss of sight of an eye, the 1562
portion of one hundred twenty-five weeks as the administrator in 1563
each case determines, based upon the percentage of vision 1564
actually lost as a result of the injury or occupational disease, 1565
but, in no case shall an award of compensation be made for less 1566
than twenty-five per cent loss of uncorrected vision. "Loss of 1567
uncorrected vision" means the percentage of vision actually lost 1568
as the result of the injury or occupational disease. 1569
For the permanent and total loss of hearing of one ear, 1570
twenty-five weeks; but in no case shall an award of compensation 1571
be made for less than permanent and total loss of hearing of one 1572
ear. 1573
For the permanent and total loss of hearing, one hundred 1574
twenty-five weeks; but, except pursuant to the next preceding 1575
paragraph, in no case shall an award of compensation be made for 1576
less than permanent and total loss of hearing. 1577
In case an injury or occupational disease results in 1578
serious facial or head disfigurement which either impairs or may 1579
in the future impair the opportunities to secure or retain 1580
employment, the administrator shall make an award of 1581
compensation as it deems proper and equitable, in view of the 1582
nature of the disfigurement, and not to exceed the sum of ten 1583
thousand dollars. For the purpose of making the award, it is not 1584
material whether the employee is gainfully employed in any 1585
occupation or trade at the time of the administrator's 1586
determination. 1587
When an award under this division has been made prior to 1588
Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 55
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
the death of an employee all unpaid installments accrued or to 1589
accrue under the provisions of the award shall be payable to the 1590
surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse, to the 1591
dependent children of the employee and if there are no such 1592
children, then to such dependents as the administrator 1593
determines. 1594
When an employee has sustained the loss of a member by 1595
severance, but no award has been made on account thereof prior 1596
to the employee's death, the administrator shall make an award 1597
in accordance with this division for the loss which shall be 1598
payable to the surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving 1599
spouse, to the dependent children of the employee and if there 1600
are no such children, then to such dependents as the 1601
administrator determines. 1602
(C) Compensation for partial impairment under divisions 1603
(A) and (B) of this section is in addition to the compensation 1604
paid the employee pursuant to section 4123.56 of the Revised 1605
Code. A claimant may receive compensation under divisions (A) 1606
and (B) of this section. 1607
In all cases arising under division (B) of this section, 1608
if it is determined by any one of the following: (1) the amputee 1609
clinic at University hospital, Ohio state university; (2) the 1610
opportunities for Ohioans with disabilities agency; (3) an 1611
amputee clinic or prescribing physician approved by the 1612
administrator or the administrator's designee, that an injured 1613
or disabled employee is in need of an artificial appliance, or 1614
in need of a repair thereof, regardless of whether the appliance 1615
or its repair will be serviceable in the vocational 1616
rehabilitation of the injured employee, and regardless of 1617
whether the employee has returned to or can ever again return to 1618
Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 56
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
any gainful employment, the bureau shall pay the cost of the 1619
artificial appliance or its repair out of the surplus created by 1620
division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code. 1621
Notwithstanding any provision in this division to the 1622
contrary, when a claimant has sustained an amputation or a loss 1623
enumerated in division (B) of this section as a result of an 1624
injury or occupational disease, the administrator shall pay the 1625
cost to purchase, repair, or replace a prosthetic device as 1626
defined in division (B) of section 4123.52 from the surplus fund 1627
account created pursuant to division (B) of section 4123.34 of 1628
the Revised Code, even if no award has been made under division 1629
(B) of this section. 1630
In those cases where an opportunities for Ohioans with 1631
disabilities agency's recommendation that an injured or disabled 1632
employee is in need of an artificial appliance would conflict 1633
with their state plan, adopted pursuant to the "Rehabilitation 1634
Act of 1973," 87 Stat. 355, 29 U.S.C.A. 701, the administrator 1635
or the administrator's designee or the bureau may obtain a 1636
recommendation from an amputee clinic or prescribing physician 1637
that they determine appropriate. 1638
(D) If an employee of a state fund employer makes 1639
application for a finding and the administrator finds that the 1640
employee has contracted silicosis as defined in division (Y), or 1641
coal miners' pneumoconiosis as defined in division (Z), or 1642
asbestosis as defined in division (BB) of section 4123.68 of the 1643
Revised Code, and that a change of such employee's occupation is 1644
medically advisable in order to decrease substantially further 1645
exposure to silica dust, asbestos, or coal dust and if the 1646
employee, after the finding, has changed or shall change the 1647
employee's occupation to an occupation in which the exposure to 1648
Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 57
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
silica dust, asbestos, or coal dust is substantially decreased, 1649
the administrator shall allow to the employee an amount equal to 1650
fifty per cent of the statewide average weekly wage per week for 1651
a period of thirty weeks, commencing as of the date of the 1652
discontinuance or change, and for a period of one hundred weeks 1653
immediately following the expiration of the period of thirty 1654
weeks, the employee shall receive sixty-six and two-thirds per 1655
cent of the loss of wages resulting directly and solely from the 1656
change of occupation but not to exceed a maximum of an amount 1657
equal to fifty per cent of the statewide average weekly wage per 1658
week. No such employee is entitled to receive more than one 1659
allowance on account of discontinuance of employment or change 1660
of occupation and benefits shall cease for any period during 1661
which the employee is employed in an occupation in which the 1662
exposure to silica dust, asbestos, or coal dust is not 1663
substantially less than the exposure in the occupation in which 1664
the employee was formerly employed or for any period during 1665
which the employee may be entitled to receive compensation or 1666
benefits under section 4123.68 of the Revised Code on account of 1667
disability from silicosis, asbestosis, or coal miners' 1668
pneumoconiosis. An award for change of occupation for a coal 1669
miner who has contracted coal miners' pneumoconiosis may be 1670
granted under this division even though the coal miner continues 1671
employment with the same employer, so long as the coal miner's 1672
employment subsequent to the change is such that the coal 1673
miner's exposure to coal dust is substantially decreased and a 1674
change of occupation is certified by the claimant as permanent. 1675
The administrator may accord to the employee medical and other 1676
benefits in accordance with section 4123.66 of the Revised Code. 1677
(E) If a firefighter or police officer makes application 1678
for a finding and the administrator finds that the firefighter 1679
Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 58
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
or police officer has contracted a cardiovascular and pulmonary 1680
disease as defined in division (W) of section 4123.68 of the 1681
Revised Code, and that a change of the firefighter's or police 1682
officer's occupation is medically advisable in order to decrease 1683
substantially further exposure to smoke, toxic gases, chemical 1684
fumes, and other toxic vapors, and if the firefighter, or police 1685
officer, after the finding, has changed or changes occupation to 1686
an occupation in which the exposure to smoke, toxic gases, 1687
chemical fumes, and other toxic vapors is substantially 1688
decreased, the administrator shall allow to the firefighter or 1689
police officer an amount equal to fifty per cent of the 1690
statewide average weekly wage per week for a period of thirty 1691
weeks, commencing as of the date of the discontinuance or 1692
change, and for a period of seventy-five weeks immediately 1693
following the expiration of the period of thirty weeks the 1694
administrator shall allow the firefighter or police officer 1695
sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the loss of wages resulting 1696
directly and solely from the change of occupation but not to 1697
exceed a maximum of an amount equal to fifty per cent of the 1698

representative files notice that the time period fixed in the 2192
citation for the abatement of the violation is unreasonable, the 2193

with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code. 2195
(H) In establishing the time limits in which a public 2196
employer must abate a violation under this section, the 2197
administrator shall consider the costs to the public employer, 2198
the size and financial resources of the public employer, the 2199
severity of the violation, the technological feasibility of the 2200
public employer's ability to comply with requirements of the 2201
citation, the possible present and future detriment to the 2202
health and safety of any public employee for failure of the 2203
public employer to comply with requirements of the citation, and 2204
such other factors as the administrator determines appropriate. 2205

permit the public employer to comply with the citation over a 2207
period of up to two years and may extend that period an 2208
additional one year, as the administrator determines 2209
appropriate. 2210

employed by the bureau of workers' compensation or by any 50
person, partnership, or corporation that has provided to the 51
bureau services of a financial or investment nature, including 52
the management, analysis, supervision, or investment of assets. 53
(B) Of the initial appointments made to the board, the 54
governor shall appoint the member who represents employees, one 55
member who represents employers, and the member who represents 56
the public to a term ending one year after June 11, 2007; one 57

Each member shall hold office from the date of the member's 68
appointment until the end of the term for which the member was 69
appointed. 70
Members may be reappointed. Any member appointed to fill a 71
vacancy occurring prior to the expiration date of the term for 72
which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office 73
as a member for the remainder of that term. A member shall 74
continue in office subsequent to the expiration date of the 75

workers' compensation board of directors nominating committee 80
pursuant to this division. The nominating committee shall submit 81

At least thirty days prior to a vacancy occurring as a 86
result of the expiration of a term and within thirty days after 87
other vacancies occurring on the board, the nominating committee 88

vacancy. Within fourteen days after the submission of the 90
initial list, the governor either shall appoint individuals from 91
that list or request the nominating committee to submit another 92
list of four names for each member the governor has not 93
appointed from the initial list, which list the nominating 94
committee shall submit to the governor within fourteen days 95
after the governor's request. The governor then shall appoint, 96
within seven days after the submission of the second list, one 97
of the individuals from either list to fill the vacancy for 98
which the governor has not made an appointment from the initial 99
list. If the governor appoints an individual to fill a vacancy 100
occurring as a result of the expiration of a term, the 101
individual appointed shall begin serving as a member of the 102
board when the term for which the individual's predecessor was 103
appointed expires or immediately upon appointment by the 104
governor, whichever occurs later. With respect to the filling of 105
vacancies, the nominating committee shall provide the governor 106
with a list of four individuals who are, in the judgment of the 107
nominating committee, the most fully qualified to accede to 108
membership on the board. 109
In order for the name of an individual to be submitted to 110

twelve within a year that the member attends. 129
(3) Except as provided in division (D)(4) of this section, 130

member serves. 143
The chairperson of the board shall set the meeting dates 144
of the board as necessary to perform the duties of the board 145

described under this division may affect the employee's 1043
eligibility for compensation and benefits pursuant to this 1044
chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code, there is a 1045
rebuttable presumption that an employee is intoxicated, under 1046

(2) When the employee refuses to submit to a requested 1079
chemical test, on the condition that that employee is or was 1080
given notice that the refusal to submit to any chemical test 1081
described in division (B)(1) of this section may affect the 1082

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 38
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee

chemical test is a qualifying chemical test if it is 1086
administered to an employee after an injury under at least one 1087
of the following conditions: 1088

changes in affect; or dynamic mood swings; 1115
(b) A pattern of abnormal conduct, erratic or aberrant 1116
behavior, or deteriorating work performance such as frequent 1117

use of alcohol, a controlled substance, or marihuana and that do 1131
not appear attributable to other factors. 1132
(D) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect 1133
the rights of an employer to test employees for alcohol or 1134
controlled substance abuse. 1135
(E) For the purpose of this section, laboratories 1136
certified by the United States department of health and human 1137
services or laboratories that meet or exceed the standards of 1138
that department for laboratory certification shall be used for 1139
processing the test results of a qualifying chemical test. 1140

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 40
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
workers' compensation coverage furnished by the bureau of 1143
workers' compensation and shall be posted by the employer in the 1144
same location as the proof of workers' compensation coverage or 1145
the certificate of self-insurance. 1146
(G) If a condition that pre-existed an injury is 1147
substantially aggravated by the injury, and that substantial 1148
aggravation is documented by objective diagnostic findings, 1149
objective clinical findings, or objective test results, no 1150
compensation or benefits are payable because of the pre-existing 1151
condition once that condition has returned to a level that would 1152
have existed without the injury. 1153
(H)(1) Whenever, with respect to an employee of an 1154
employer who is subject to and has complied with this chapter, 1155
there is possibility of conflict with respect to the application 1156
of workers' compensation laws because the contract of employment 1157
is entered into and all or some portion of the work is or is to 1158
be performed in a state or states other than Ohio, the employer 1159
and the employee may agree to be bound by the laws of this state 1160
or by the laws of some other state in which all or some portion 1161
of the work of the employee is to be performed. The agreement 1162
shall be in writing and shall be filed with the bureau of 1163
workers' compensation within ten days after it is executed and 1164
shall remain in force until terminated or modified by agreement 1165
of the parties similarly filed. If the agreement is to be bound 1166
by the laws of this state and the employer has complied with 1167
this chapter, then the employee is entitled to compensation and 1168
benefits regardless of where the injury occurs or the disease is 1169
contracted and the rights of the employee and the employee's 1170
dependents under the laws of this state are the exclusive remedy 1171
against the employer on account of injury, disease, or death in 1172
the course of and arising out of the employee's employment. If 1173

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 41
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
the agreement is to be bound by the laws of another state and 1174
the employer has complied with the laws of that state, the 1175
rights of the employee and the employee's dependents under the 1176
laws of that state are the exclusive remedy against the employer 1177
on account of injury, disease, or death in the course of and 1178
arising out of the employee's employment without regard to the 1179
place where the injury was sustained or the disease contracted. 1180
If an employer and an employee enter into an agreement under 1181
this division, the fact that the employer and the employee 1182
entered into that agreement shall not be construed to change the 1183
status of an employee whose continued employment is subject to 1184
the will of the employer or the employee, unless the agreement 1185
contains a provision that expressly changes that status. 1186
(2) If an employee or the employee's dependents receive an 1187
award of compensation or benefits under this chapter or Chapter 1188
4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for the same injury, 1189
occupational disease, or death for which the employee or the 1190
employee's dependents previously pursued or otherwise elected to 1191
accept workers' compensation benefits and received a decision on 1192
the merits as defined in section 4123.542 of the Revised Code 1193
under the laws of another state or recovered damages under the 1194
laws of another state, the claim shall be disallowed and the 1195
administrator or any self-insuring employer, by any lawful 1196
means, may collect from the employee or the employee's 1197
dependents any of the following: 1198
(a) The amount of compensation or benefits paid to or on 1199
behalf of the employee or the employee's dependents by the 1200
administrator or a self-insuring employer pursuant to this 1201
chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code 1202
for that award; 1203

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 42

(b) Any interest, attorney's fees, and costs the 1204
administrator or the self-insuring employer incurs in collecting 1205
that payment. 1206
(3) If an employee or the employee's dependents receive an 1207
award of compensation or benefits under this chapter or Chapter 1208
4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code and subsequently 1209
pursue or otherwise elect to accept workers' compensation 1210
benefits or damages under the laws of another state for the same 1211
injury, occupational disease, or death the claim under this 1212
chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code 1213
shall be disallowed. The administrator or a self-insuring 1214
employer, by any lawful means, may collect from the employee or 1215
the employee's dependents or other-states' insurer any of the 1216
following: 1217
(a) The amount of compensation or benefits paid to or on 1218
behalf of the employee or the employee's dependents by the 1219
administrator or the self-insuring employer pursuant to this 1220
chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code 1221
for that award; 1222
(b) Any interest, costs, and attorney's fees the 1223
administrator or the self-insuring employer incurs in collecting 1224
that payment; 1225
(c) Any costs incurred by an employer in contesting or 1226
responding to any claim filed by the employee or the employee's 1227
dependents for the same injury, occupational disease, or death 1228
that was filed after the original claim for which the employee 1229
or the employee's dependents received a decision on the merits 1230
as described in section 4123.542 of the Revised Code. 1231
(4) If the employee's employer pays premiums into the 1232

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 43
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
state insurance fund, the administrator shall not charge the 1233
amount of compensation or benefits the administrator collects 1234
pursuant to division (H)(2) or (3) of this section to the 1235
employer's experience. If the administrator collects any costs 1236
incurred by an employer in contesting or responding to any claim 1237
pursuant to division (H)(2) or (3) of this section, the 1238
administrator shall forward the amount collected to that 1239
employer. If the employee's employer is a self-insuring 1240
employer, the self-insuring employer shall deduct the amount of 1241
compensation or benefits the self-insuring employer collects 1242
pursuant to this division from the paid compensation the self- 1243
insuring employer reports to the administrator under division 1244
(L) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code. 1245
(5) If an employee is a resident of a state other than 1246
this state and is insured under the workers' compensation law or 1247
similar laws of a state other than this state, the employee and 1248
the employee's dependents are not entitled to receive 1249
compensation or benefits under this chapter, on account of 1250
injury, disease, or death arising out of or in the course of 1251
employment while temporarily within this state, and the rights 1252
of the employee and the employee's dependents under the laws of 1253
the other state are the exclusive remedy against the employer on 1254
account of the injury, disease, or death. 1255
(6) An employee, or the dependent of an employee, who 1256
elects to receive compensation and benefits under this chapter 1257
or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code for a 1258
claim may not receive compensation and benefits under the 1259
workers' compensation laws of any state other than this state 1260
for that same claim. For each claim submitted by or on behalf of 1261
an employee, the administrator or, if the employee is employed 1262
by a self-insuring employer, the self-insuring employer, shall 1263

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 44
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
request the employee or the employee's dependent to sign an 1264
election that affirms the employee's or employee's dependent's 1265
acceptance of electing to receive compensation and benefits 1266
under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the 1267
Revised Code for that claim that also affirmatively waives and 1268
releases the employee's or the employee's dependent's right to 1269
file for and receive compensation and benefits under the laws of 1270
any state other than this state for that claim. The employee or 1271
employee's dependent shall sign the election form within twenty- 1272
eight days after the administrator or self-insuring employer 1273
submits the request or the administrator or self-insuring 1274
employer shall dismiss that claim. 1275
In the event a workers' compensation claim has been filed 1276
in another jurisdiction on behalf of an employee or the 1277
dependents of an employee, and the employee or dependents 1278
subsequently elect to receive compensation, benefits, or both 1279
under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the 1280
Revised Code, the employee or dependent shall withdraw or refuse 1281
acceptance of the workers' compensation claim filed in the other 1282
jurisdiction in order to pursue compensation or benefits under 1283
the laws of this state. If the employee or dependents were 1284
awarded workers' compensation benefits or had recovered damages 1285
under the laws of the other state, any compensation and benefits 1286
awarded under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of 1287
the Revised Code shall be paid only to the extent to which those 1288
payments exceed the amounts paid under the laws of the other 1289
state. If the employee or dependent fails to withdraw or to 1290
refuse acceptance of the workers' compensation claim in the 1291
other jurisdiction within twenty-eight days after a request made 1292
by the administrator or a self-insuring employer, the 1293
administrator or self-insuring employer shall dismiss the 1294

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 45
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
employee's or employee's dependents' claim made in this state. 1295
(I) If an employee who is covered under the federal 1296
"Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act," 98 Stat. 1639, 1297
33 U.S.C. 901 et seq., is injured or contracts an occupational 1298
disease or dies as a result of an injury or occupational 1299
disease, and if that employee's or that employee's dependents' 1300
claim for compensation or benefits for that injury, occupational 1301
disease, or death is subject to the jurisdiction of that act, 1302
the employee or the employee's dependents are not entitled to 1303
apply for and shall not receive compensation or benefits under 1304
this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised Code. The rights 1305
of such an employee and the employee's dependents under the 1306
federal "Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act," 98 1307
Stat. 1639, 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq., are the exclusive remedy 1308
against the employer for that injury, occupational disease, or 1309
death. 1310
(J) Compensation or benefits are not payable to a claimant 1311
or a dependent during the period of confinement of the claimant 1312
or dependent in any state or federal correctional institution, 1313
or in any county jail in lieu of incarceration in a state or 1314
federal correctional institution, whether in this or any other 1315
state for conviction of violation of any state or federal 1316
criminal law. 1317
(K) An employer, upon the approval of the administrator, 1318
may provide for workers' compensation coverage for the 1319
employer's employees who are professional athletes and coaches 1320
by submitting to the administrator proof of coverage under a 1321
league policy issued under the laws of another state under 1322
either of the following circumstances: 1323
(1) The employer administers the payroll and workers' 1324

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 46
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
compensation insurance for a professional sports team subject to 1325
a collective bargaining agreement, and the collective bargaining 1326
agreement provides for the uniform administration of workers' 1327
compensation benefits and compensation for professional 1328
athletes. 1329
(2) The employer is a professional sports league, or is a 1330
member team of a professional sports league, and all of the 1331
following apply: 1332
(a) The professional sports league operates as a single 1333
entity, whereby all of the players and coaches of the sports 1334
league are employees of the sports league and not of the 1335
individual member teams. 1336
(b) The professional sports league at all times maintains 1337
workers' compensation insurance that provides coverage for the 1338
players and coaches of the sports league. 1339
(c) Each individual member team of the professional sports 1340
league, pursuant to the organizational or operating documents of 1341
the sports league, is obligated to the sports league to pay to 1342
the sports league any workers' compensation claims that are not 1343
covered by the workers' compensation insurance maintained by the 1344
sports league. 1345
If the administrator approves the employer's proof of 1346
coverage submitted under division (K) of this section, a 1347
professional athlete or coach who is an employee of the employer 1348
and the dependents of the professional athlete or coach are not 1349
entitled to apply for and shall not receive compensation or 1350
benefits under this chapter and Chapter 4121. of the Revised 1351
Code. The rights of such an athlete or coach and the dependents 1352

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 47
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
the policy was issued are the exclusive remedy against the 1354
employer for the athlete or coach if the athlete or coach 1355
suffers an injury or contracts an occupational disease in the 1356
course of employment, or for the dependents of the athlete or 1357
the coach if the athlete or coach is killed as a result of an 1358
injury or dies as a result of an occupational disease, 1359
regardless of the location where the injury was suffered or the 1360
occupational disease was contracted. 1361
Sec. 4123.57. Partial disability compensation shall be 1362
paid as follows. 1363
Except as provided in this section, not earlier than 1364
twenty-six weeks after the date of termination of the latest 1365
period of payments under section 4123.56 of the Revised Code or 1366
twenty-six weeks after the termination of wages in lieu of those 1367
payments, or not earlier than twenty-six weeks after the date of 1368
the injury or contraction of an occupational disease in the 1369
absence of payments under section 4123.56 of the Revised Code or 1370
wages in lieu of those payments, the employee may file an 1371
application with the bureau of workers' compensation for the 1372
determination of the percentage of the employee's permanent 1373
partial disability resulting from an injury or occupational 1374
disease. 1375
Whenever the application is filed, the bureau shall send a 1376
copy of the application to the employee's employer or the 1377
employer's representative and shall schedule the employee for a 1378
medical examination by the bureau medical section. The bureau 1379
shall send a copy of the report of the medical examination to 1380
the employee, the employer, and their representatives. 1381
Thereafter, the administrator of workers' compensation shall 1382
review the employee's claim file and make a tentative order as 1383

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 48
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
the evidence before the administrator at the time of the making 1384
of the order warrants. If the administrator determines that 1385
there is a conflict of evidence, the administrator shall send 1386
the application, along with the claimant's file, to the district 1387
hearing officer who shall set the application for a hearing. 1388
If an employee fails to respond to an attempt to schedule 1389
a medical examination by the bureau medical section, or fails to 1390
attend a medical examination scheduled under this section 1391
without notice or explanation, the employee's application for a 1392
finding shall be dismissed without prejudice. The employee may 1393
refile the application. A dismissed application does not toll 1394
the continuing jurisdiction of the industrial commission under 1395
section 4123.52 of the Revised Code. The administrator shall 1396
adopt rules addressing the manner in which an employee will be 1397
notified of a possible dismissal and how an employee may refile 1398
an application for a determination. 1399
The administrator shall notify the employee, the employer, 1400
and their representatives, in writing, of the tentative order 1401
and of the parties' right to request a hearing. Unless the 1402
employee, the employer, or their representative notifies the 1403
administrator, in writing, of an objection to the tentative 1404
order within twenty days after receipt of the notice thereof, 1405
the tentative order shall go into effect and the employee shall 1406
receive the compensation provided in the order. In no event 1407
shall there be a reconsideration of a tentative order issued 1408
under this division. 1409
If the employee, the employer, or their representatives 1410
timely notify the administrator of an objection to the tentative 1411
order, the matter shall be referred to a district hearing 1412
officer who shall set the application for hearing with written 1413

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 49
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
notices to all interested persons. Upon referral to a district 1414
hearing officer, the employer may obtain a medical examination 1415
of the employee, pursuant to rules of the industrial commission. 1416
(A) The district hearing officer, upon the application, 1417
shall determine the percentage of the employee's permanent 1418
disability, except as is subject to division (B) of this 1419
section, based upon that condition of the employee resulting 1420
from the injury or occupational disease and causing permanent 1421
impairment evidenced by medical or clinical findings reasonably 1422
demonstrable. The employee shall receive sixty-six and two- 1423
thirds per cent of the employee's average weekly wage, but not 1424
more than a maximum of thirty-three and one-third per cent of 1425
the statewide average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of 1426
section 4123.62 of the Revised Code, per week regardless of the 1427
average weekly wage, for the number of weeks which equals the 1428
percentage of two hundred weeks. Except on application for 1429
reconsideration, review, or modification, which is filed within 1430
ten days after the date of receipt of the decision of the 1431
district hearing officer, in no instance shall the former award 1432
be modified unless it is found from medical or clinical findings 1433
that the condition of the claimant resulting from the injury has 1434
so progressed as to have increased the percentage of permanent 1435
partial disability. A staff hearing officer shall hear an 1436
application for reconsideration filed and the staff hearing 1437
officer's decision is final. An employee may file an application 1438
for a subsequent determination of the percentage of the 1439
employee's permanent disability. If such an application is 1440
filed, the bureau shall send a copy of the application to the 1441
employer or the employer's representative. No sooner than sixty 1442
days from the date of the mailing of the application to the 1443
employer or the employer's representative, the administrator 1444

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 50
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
shall review the application. The administrator may require a 1445
medical examination or medical review of the employee. The 1446
administrator shall issue a tentative order based upon the 1447
evidence before the administrator, provided that if the 1448
administrator requires a medical examination or medical review, 1449
the administrator shall not issue the tentative order until the 1450
completion of the examination or review. 1451
The employer may obtain a medical examination of the 1452
employee and may submit medical evidence at any stage of the 1453
process up to a hearing before the district hearing officer, 1454
pursuant to rules of the commission. The administrator shall 1455
notify the employee, the employer, and their representatives, in 1456
writing, of the nature and amount of any tentative order issued 1457
on an application requesting a subsequent determination of the 1458
percentage of an employee's permanent disability. An employee, 1459
employer, or their representatives may object to the tentative 1460
order within twenty days after the receipt of the notice 1461
thereof. If no timely objection is made, the tentative order 1462
shall go into effect. In no event shall there be a 1463
reconsideration of a tentative order issued under this division. 1464
If an objection is timely made, the application for a subsequent 1465
determination shall be referred to a district hearing officer 1466
who shall set the application for a hearing with written notice 1467
to all interested persons. No application for subsequent 1468
percentage determinations on the same claim for injury or 1469
occupational disease shall be accepted for review by the 1470
district hearing officer unless supported by substantial 1471
evidence of new and changed circumstances developing since the 1472
time of the hearing on the original or last determination. 1473
No award shall be made under this division based upon a 1474
percentage of disability which, when taken with all other 1475

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 51
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
percentages of permanent disability, exceeds one hundred per 1476
cent. If the percentage of the permanent disability of the 1477
employee equals or exceeds ninety per cent, compensation for 1478
permanent partial disability shall be paid for two hundred 1479
weeks. 1480
Compensation payable under this division accrues and is 1481
payable to the employee from the date of last payment of 1482
compensation, or, in cases where no previous compensation has 1483
been paid, from the date of the injury or the date of the 1484
diagnosis of the occupational disease. 1485
When an award under this division has been made prior to 1486
the death of an employee, all unpaid installments accrued or to 1487
accrue under the provisions of the award are payable to the 1488
surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse, to the 1489
dependent children of the employee, and if there are no children 1490
surviving, then to other dependents as the administrator 1491
determines. 1492
(B) For purposes of this division, "payable per week" 1493
means the seven-consecutive-day period in which compensation is 1494
paid in installments according to the schedule associated with 1495
the applicable injury as set forth in this division. 1496
Compensation paid in weekly installments according to the 1497
schedule described in this division may only be commuted to one 1498
or more lump sum payments pursuant to the procedure set forth in 1499
section 4123.64 of the Revised Code. 1500
In cases included in the following schedule the 1501
compensation payable per week to the employee is the statewide 1502
average weekly wage as defined in division (C) of section 1503
4123.62 of the Revised Code per week and shall be paid in 1504

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 52
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
installments according to the following schedule: 1505
For the loss of a first finger, commonly known as a thumb, 1506
sixty weeks. 1507
For the loss of a second finger, commonly called index 1508
finger, thirty-five weeks. 1509
For the loss of a third finger, thirty weeks. 1510
For the loss of a fourth finger, twenty weeks. 1511
For the loss of a fifth finger, commonly known as the 1512
little finger, fifteen weeks. 1513
The loss of a second, or distal, phalange of the thumb is 1514
considered equal to the loss of one half of such thumb; the loss 1515
of more than one half of such thumb is considered equal to the 1516
loss of the whole thumb. 1517
The loss of the third, or distal, phalange of any finger 1518
is considered equal to the loss of one-third of the finger. 1519
The loss of the middle, or second, phalange of any finger 1520
is considered equal to the loss of two-thirds of the finger. 1521
The loss of more than the middle and distal phalanges of 1522
any finger is considered equal to the loss of the whole finger. 1523
In no case shall the amount received for more than one finger 1524
exceed the amount provided in this schedule for the loss of a 1525
hand. 1526
For the loss of the metacarpal bone (bones of the palm) 1527
for the corresponding thumb, or fingers, add ten weeks to the 1528
number of weeks under this division. 1529
For ankylosis (total stiffness of) or contractures (due to 1530
scars or injuries) which makes any of the fingers, thumbs, or 1531

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 53
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
parts of either useless, the same number of weeks apply to the 1532
members or parts thereof as given for the loss thereof. 1533
If the claimant has suffered the loss of two or more 1534
fingers by amputation or ankylosis and the nature of the 1535
claimant's employment in the course of which the claimant was 1536
working at the time of the injury or occupational disease is 1537
such that the impairment or disability resulting from the loss 1538
of fingers, or loss of use of fingers, exceeds the normal 1539
impairment or disability resulting from the loss of fingers, or 1540
loss of use of fingers, the administrator may take that fact 1541
into consideration and increase the award of compensation 1542
accordingly, but the award made shall not exceed the amount of 1543
compensation for loss of a hand. 1544
For the loss of a hand, one hundred seventy-five weeks. 1545
For the loss of an arm, two hundred twenty-five weeks. 1546
For the loss of a great toe, thirty weeks. 1547
For the loss of one of the toes other than the great toe, 1548
ten weeks. 1549
The loss of more than two-thirds of any toe is considered 1550
equal to the loss of the whole toe. 1551
The loss of less than two-thirds of any toe is considered 1552
no loss, except as to the great toe; the loss of the great toe 1553
up to the interphalangeal joint is co-equal to the loss of one- 1554
half of the great toe; the loss of the great toe beyond the 1555
interphalangeal joint is considered equal to the loss of the 1556
whole great toe. 1557
For the loss of a foot, one hundred fifty weeks. 1558
For the loss of a leg, two hundred weeks. 1559

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 54
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
For the loss of the sight of an eye, one hundred twenty- 1560
five weeks. 1561
For the permanent partial loss of sight of an eye, the 1562
portion of one hundred twenty-five weeks as the administrator in 1563
each case determines, based upon the percentage of vision 1564
actually lost as a result of the injury or occupational disease, 1565
but, in no case shall an award of compensation be made for less 1566
than twenty-five per cent loss of uncorrected vision. "Loss of 1567
uncorrected vision" means the percentage of vision actually lost 1568
as the result of the injury or occupational disease. 1569
For the permanent and total loss of hearing of one ear, 1570
twenty-five weeks; but in no case shall an award of compensation 1571
be made for less than permanent and total loss of hearing of one 1572
ear. 1573
For the permanent and total loss of hearing, one hundred 1574
twenty-five weeks; but, except pursuant to the next preceding 1575
paragraph, in no case shall an award of compensation be made for 1576
less than permanent and total loss of hearing. 1577
In case an injury or occupational disease results in 1578
serious facial or head disfigurement which either impairs or may 1579
in the future impair the opportunities to secure or retain 1580
employment, the administrator shall make an award of 1581
compensation as it deems proper and equitable, in view of the 1582
nature of the disfigurement, and not to exceed the sum of ten 1583
thousand dollars. For the purpose of making the award, it is not 1584
material whether the employee is gainfully employed in any 1585
occupation or trade at the time of the administrator's 1586
determination. 1587
When an award under this division has been made prior to 1588

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 55
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
the death of an employee all unpaid installments accrued or to 1589
accrue under the provisions of the award shall be payable to the 1590
surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse, to the 1591
dependent children of the employee and if there are no such 1592
children, then to such dependents as the administrator 1593
determines. 1594
When an employee has sustained the loss of a member by 1595
severance, but no award has been made on account thereof prior 1596
to the employee's death, the administrator shall make an award 1597
in accordance with this division for the loss which shall be 1598
payable to the surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving 1599
spouse, to the dependent children of the employee and if there 1600
are no such children, then to such dependents as the 1601
administrator determines. 1602
(C) Compensation for partial impairment under divisions 1603
(A) and (B) of this section is in addition to the compensation 1604
paid the employee pursuant to section 4123.56 of the Revised 1605
Code. A claimant may receive compensation under divisions (A) 1606
and (B) of this section. 1607
In all cases arising under division (B) of this section, 1608
if it is determined by any one of the following: (1) the amputee 1609
clinic at University hospital, Ohio state university; (2) the 1610
opportunities for Ohioans with disabilities agency; (3) an 1611
amputee clinic or prescribing physician approved by the 1612
administrator or the administrator's designee, that an injured 1613
or disabled employee is in need of an artificial appliance, or 1614
in need of a repair thereof, regardless of whether the appliance 1615
or its repair will be serviceable in the vocational 1616
rehabilitation of the injured employee, and regardless of 1617
whether the employee has returned to or can ever again return to 1618

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 56
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
any gainful employment, the bureau shall pay the cost of the 1619
artificial appliance or its repair out of the surplus created by 1620
division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code. 1621
Notwithstanding any provision in this division to the 1622
contrary, when a claimant has sustained an amputation or a loss 1623
enumerated in division (B) of this section as a result of an 1624
injury or occupational disease, the administrator shall pay the 1625
cost to purchase, repair, or replace a prosthetic device as 1626
defined in division (B) of section 4123.52 from the surplus fund 1627
account created pursuant to division (B) of section 4123.34 of 1628
the Revised Code, even if no award has been made under division 1629
(B) of this section. 1630
In those cases where an opportunities for Ohioans with 1631
disabilities agency's recommendation that an injured or disabled 1632
employee is in need of an artificial appliance would conflict 1633
with their state plan, adopted pursuant to the "Rehabilitation 1634
Act of 1973," 87 Stat. 355, 29 U.S.C.A. 701, the administrator 1635
or the administrator's designee or the bureau may obtain a 1636
recommendation from an amputee clinic or prescribing physician 1637
that they determine appropriate. 1638
(D) If an employee of a state fund employer makes 1639
application for a finding and the administrator finds that the 1640
employee has contracted silicosis as defined in division (Y), or 1641
coal miners' pneumoconiosis as defined in division (Z), or 1642
asbestosis as defined in division (BB) of section 4123.68 of the 1643
Revised Code, and that a change of such employee's occupation is 1644
medically advisable in order to decrease substantially further 1645
exposure to silica dust, asbestos, or coal dust and if the 1646
employee, after the finding, has changed or shall change the 1647
employee's occupation to an occupation in which the exposure to 1648

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 57
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
silica dust, asbestos, or coal dust is substantially decreased, 1649
the administrator shall allow to the employee an amount equal to 1650
fifty per cent of the statewide average weekly wage per week for 1651
a period of thirty weeks, commencing as of the date of the 1652
discontinuance or change, and for a period of one hundred weeks 1653
immediately following the expiration of the period of thirty 1654
weeks, the employee shall receive sixty-six and two-thirds per 1655
cent of the loss of wages resulting directly and solely from the 1656
change of occupation but not to exceed a maximum of an amount 1657
equal to fifty per cent of the statewide average weekly wage per 1658
week. No such employee is entitled to receive more than one 1659
allowance on account of discontinuance of employment or change 1660
of occupation and benefits shall cease for any period during 1661
which the employee is employed in an occupation in which the 1662
exposure to silica dust, asbestos, or coal dust is not 1663
substantially less than the exposure in the occupation in which 1664
the employee was formerly employed or for any period during 1665
which the employee may be entitled to receive compensation or 1666
benefits under section 4123.68 of the Revised Code on account of 1667
disability from silicosis, asbestosis, or coal miners' 1668
pneumoconiosis. An award for change of occupation for a coal 1669
miner who has contracted coal miners' pneumoconiosis may be 1670
granted under this division even though the coal miner continues 1671
employment with the same employer, so long as the coal miner's 1672
employment subsequent to the change is such that the coal 1673
miner's exposure to coal dust is substantially decreased and a 1674
change of occupation is certified by the claimant as permanent. 1675
The administrator may accord to the employee medical and other 1676
benefits in accordance with section 4123.66 of the Revised Code. 1677
(E) If a firefighter or police officer makes application 1678
for a finding and the administrator finds that the firefighter 1679

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 58
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
or police officer has contracted a cardiovascular and pulmonary 1680
disease as defined in division (W) of section 4123.68 of the 1681
Revised Code, and that a change of the firefighter's or police 1682
officer's occupation is medically advisable in order to decrease 1683
substantially further exposure to smoke, toxic gases, chemical 1684
fumes, and other toxic vapors, and if the firefighter, or police 1685
officer, after the finding, has changed or changes occupation to 1686
an occupation in which the exposure to smoke, toxic gases, 1687
chemical fumes, and other toxic vapors is substantially 1688
decreased, the administrator shall allow to the firefighter or 1689
police officer an amount equal to fifty per cent of the 1690
statewide average weekly wage per week for a period of thirty 1691
weeks, commencing as of the date of the discontinuance or 1692
change, and for a period of seventy-five weeks immediately 1693
following the expiration of the period of thirty weeks the 1694
administrator shall allow the firefighter or police officer 1695
sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the loss of wages resulting 1696
directly and solely from the change of occupation but not to 1697
exceed a maximum of an amount equal to fifty per cent of the 1698
statewide average weekly wage per week. No such firefighter or 1699
police officer is entitled to receive more than one allowance on 1700
account of discontinuance of employment or change of occupation 1701
and benefits shall cease for any period during which the 1702
firefighter or police officer is employed in an occupation in 1703
which the exposure to smoke, toxic gases, chemical fumes, and 1704
other toxic vapors is not substantially less than the exposure 1705
in the occupation in which the firefighter or police officer was 1706
formerly employed or for any period during which the firefighter 1707
or police officer may be entitled to receive compensation or 1708
benefits under section 4123.68 of the Revised Code on account of 1709
disability from a cardiovascular and pulmonary disease. The 1710
administrator may accord to the firefighter or police officer 1711

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 59

medical and other benefits in accordance with section 4123.66 of 1712
the Revised Code. 1713
(F) An order issued under this section is appealable 1714
pursuant to section 4123.511 of the Revised Code but is not 1715
appealable to court under section 4123.512 of the Revised Code. 1716
Sec. 4123.66. (A) In addition to the compensation provided 1717
for in this chapter, the administrator of workers' compensation 1718
shall disburse and pay from the state insurance fund the amounts 1719

administrator deems proper and, in case death ensues from the 1721
injury or occupational disease, the administrator shall disburse 1722
and pay from the fund reasonable funeral expenses in an amount 1723
not to exceed seven thousand five hundred dollars. The bureau of 1724
workers' compensation shall reimburse anyone, whether dependent, 1725
volunteer, or otherwise, who pays the funeral expenses of any 1726
employee whose death ensues from any injury or occupational 1727
disease as provided in this section. The administrator may adopt 1728
rules, with the advice and consent of the bureau of workers' 1729
compensation board of directors, with respect to furnishing 1730
medical, nurse, and hospital service and medicine to injured or 1731
disabled employees entitled thereto, and for the payment 1732
therefor. In case an injury or industrial accident that injures 1733
an employee also causes damage to the employee's eyeglasses, 1734
artificial teeth or other denture, or hearing aid, or in the 1735
event an injury or occupational disease makes it necessary or 1736
advisable to replace, repair, or adjust the same, the bureau 1737
shall disburse and pay a reasonable amount to repair or replace 1738
the same. 1739
(B) The administrator, in the rules the administrator 1740

that occurs prior to the date the administrator issues an 1746
initial determination order under division (B) of section 1747
4123.511 of the Revised Code. If the claim is ultimately 1748
disallowed in a final administrative or judicial order, and if 1749
the employer is a state fund employer who pays assessments into 1750
the surplus fund account created under section 4123.34 of the 1751
Revised Code, the payments for medical services made pursuant to 1752
this division for the first fill of prescription drugs shall be 1753
charged to and paid from the surplus fund account and not 1754
charged through the state insurance fund to the employer against 1755
whom the claim was filed. 1756
(C)(1) If an employer or a welfare plan has provided to or 1757
on behalf of an employee any benefits or compensation for an 1758
injury or occupational disease and that injury or occupational 1759
disease is determined compensable under this chapter, the 1760
employer or a welfare plan may request that the administrator 1761
reimburse the employer or welfare plan for the amount the 1762
employer or welfare plan paid to or on behalf of the employee in 1763
compensation or benefits. The administrator shall reimburse the 1764
employer or welfare plan for the compensation and benefits paid 1765
if, at the time the employer or welfare plan provides the 1766
benefits or compensation to or on behalf of employee, the injury 1767
or occupational disease had not been determined to be 1768
compensable under this chapter and if the employee was not 1769
receiving compensation or benefits under this chapter for that 1770
injury or occupational disease. The administrator shall 1771
reimburse the employer or welfare plan in the amount that the 1772

Am. H. B. No. 81 Page 61
As Reported by the House Public Insurance and Pensions Committee
administrator would have paid to or on behalf of the employee 1773
under this chapter if the injury or occupational disease 1774
originally would have been determined compensable under this 1775
chapter. If the employer is a merit-rated employer, the 1776
administrator shall adjust the amount of premium next due from 1777
the employer according to the amount the administrator pays the 1778
employer. The administrator shall adopt rules, in accordance 1779
with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code, to implement this 1780
division. 1781

cost of medical assistance paid on behalf of a medical 1796
assistance recipient. 1797

department, or any other entity with a lawful right to 1814
reimbursement from recovering sums greater than five hundred 1815
dollars. 1816

specified by the administrator and notice of all workers' 1836
compensation claims that have been reported to the professional 1837

public employer to comply with requirements of the citation, and 2204
