and, if the grantee is not a natural person, the name and 109

section 319.204 of the Revised Code, and a reference to the 111
volume and page of the recording, or other means of identifying 112
the recording, of the next preceding recorded instrument by or 113
through which the grantor claims title, the county auditor shall 114
transfer any land or town lot or part thereof, minerals therein, 115
or mineral rights thereto, charged with taxes on the tax list, 116
from the name in which it stands into the name of the owner, 117
when rendered necessary by a conveyance, partition, devise, 118
descent, or otherwise. If by reason of the conveyance or 119
otherwise, a part only of a tract or lot, minerals therein, or 120
mineral rights thereto, as charged in the tax list, is to be 121
transferred, the auditor shall determine the tax value of the 122
part of a tract or lot of real estate, minerals therein, or 123
mineral rights thereto, so transferred, and the value of the 124
remaining part compared with the value of the whole. 125
Whenever a part only of a tract or lot of real estate has 126

unpaid taxes, penalties, interest, or special assessments, the 128
unpaid taxes, penalties, interest, or special assessments shall 129
immediately be apportioned, upon demand or request by the 130
transferee or remaining owner, in the following manner: 131
(A) The auditor shall allocate to the part so transferred, 132

(B) The lien of taxes, penalties, interest, and special 136

assessments, as levied against the original tract, shall extend 137
to the part so transferred and the part remaining only to the 138
extent of the amounts so allocated to the respective parts. 139
This section does not change the total amount of taxes, 140
special assessments, or other charges as originally levied, or 141
the total amount of the balance due. The auditor shall certify 142
such apportionments to the county treasurer. 143
Whenever the state acquires an entire parcel or a part 144
only of a parcel of real property in fee simple, the county 145
auditor, upon application of the grantor or property owner or 146
the state, which application shall contain a description of the 147
property as it appears on the tax list and the date of transfer 148
of ownership, shall prepare an estimate of the taxes that are a 149
lien on the property, but have not been determined, assessed, 150
and levied for the year in which the property was acquired. The 151
county auditor shall thereupon apportion the estimated taxes 152
proportionately between the grantor and the state for the period 153
of the lien year that each had or shall have had ownership or 154
possession of the property, whichever is earlier. The county 155
treasurer shall accept payment from the state for estimated 156
taxes at the time that the real property is acquired. If the 157
state has paid in full in the year in which the property is 158
acquired that proportion of the estimated taxes that the tax 159
commissioner determines are not subject to remission by the 160
county auditor for such year under division (D) of section 161
5713.08 of the Revised Code, the estimated taxes paid shall be 162
considered the tax liability on the exempted property for that 163
year. 164
Section 319.42 of the Revised Code applies to the 165
apportionment of special assessments. 166

the real estate described in the deed has been made in the 176
auditor's office or that it is not entered for taxation, and 177

or any one of the grantees, set forth in the deed or other 179
