authority for such purposes in a calendar year shall not exceed 276
twenty-five per cent of the total revenue from the tax in the 277
preceding calendar year. Revenue allocated for such purposes 278
that is not fully used by the end of the calendar year may be 279
carried forward for use in subsequent calendar years. Any amount 280
carried forward does not count toward the limitation on the 281
amount that may be allocated for such purposes in succeeding 282
calendar years. 283
