petition is filed, the legislative authority of the municipal 561
corporation to which annexation is proposed and board of 562
township trustees of each township any portion of which is 563
included within the territory proposed for annexation may adopt 564

benefits to the territory proposed to be annexed and the 582
surrounding area will outweigh the detriments to the territory 583
proposed to be annexed and the surrounding area, if the proposed 584
annexation is granted. If, instead the board finds the general 585
good is not served, the board shall enter upon its journal a 586
resolution denying the annexation. As used in this section, 587
"surrounding area" has the same meaning as in section 709.033 of 588
the Revised Code. 589

shall proceed as provided in division (E) of this section. 594
Failure of the municipal corporation to timely file its response 595
under division (C) of this section or any failure of those 596
townships to timely file an ordinance or a resolution consenting 597

and was filed in the manner provided in, section 709.021 of the 608

five two hundred acres. 614
(4) The territory proposed for annexation shares a 615

this section, the clerk of the board of county commissioners 658
shall proceed as provided in division (C)(1) of section 709.033 659

any party may seek a writ of mandamus to compel the board of 663
county commissioners to perform its duties under this section. 664

annexed territory, territory annexed into a municipal 671
corporation pursuant to this section shall not at any time be 672

the owner of the annexed territory to provide a buffer zone, may 681
commence in the court of common pleas a civil action against 682
that owner to enforce compliance with that buffer requirement 683

hearing from the board, to the parties and property owners 799
entitled to notice under division (B) of this section, notice of 800
the date, time, and place of the hearing. Notice to a property 801

the boundary line between a township and the municipal 828
corporation as to create a road maintenance problem, or if the 829
street or highway will be so divided or segmented, the municipal 830
corporation has agreed, as a condition of the annexation, that 831
it will assume the maintenance of that street or highway. For 832
the purposes of this division, "street" or "highway" has the 833
same meaning as in section 4511.01 of the Revised Code. 834
(4) The municipal corporation to which the territory is 835
proposed to be annexed has adopted an ordinance or resolution as 836
required by division (C)(2) of this section. 837
(5) The state director of development has certified that 838

the board of county commissioners. 842
(6) On balance, the general good of the territory proposed 843

Code, territory annexed into a municipal corporation pursuant to 859
this section shall not at any time be excluded from the township 860

enter into a written agreement pursuant to section 3735.671 of 967
the Revised Code prior to commencement of construction or 968

cases involving a structure of historical or architectural 980
significance, the housing officer shall not determine whether 981
the remodeling meets the requirements for a tax exemption unless 982
the appropriateness of the remodeling has been certified, in 983
writing, by the society, association, agency, or legislative 984
authority that has designated the structure or by any 985

board, shall approve or disapprove the application and certify a 997
copy of the resolution to the property owner and the housing 998
officer not later than forty-five days after the application is 999
certified to the board. The board may include in the resolution 1000
conditions under which the board would approve the application. 1001
The housing officer may approve an application at any time after 1002
the board certifies its resolution approving the application, 1003
or, if the board approves the application conditionally, at any 1004
time after the housing officer is notified that the conditions 1005
are agreed to by the board and the property owner. 1006
(2) Approval of an application by a board of education is 1007
not required under division (C)(1) of this section if, for each 1008
tax year the dwelling is exempted from taxation, the sum of the 1009
following quantities, as estimated at or prior to the time the 1010
application is formally approved by the housing officer, equals 1011
or exceeds twenty-five per cent of the amount of taxes, as 1012
estimated at or prior to that time, that would have been charged 1013
and payable that year upon the dwelling had that dwelling not 1014
been exempted from taxation: 1015
(a) The amount of taxes charged and payable on any portion 1016
of the assessed valuation of the new dwelling or of the 1017
increased assessed valuation of an existing dwelling after 1018
remodeling began that will not be exempted from taxation under 1019
the agreement; 1020
(b) The amount of any cash payment by the owner of the 1021
dwelling to the school district and any payment by the 1022
legislative authority that designated the community reinvestment 1023
area to the school district pursuant to section 5709.82 of the 1024
Revised Code. 1025
H. B. No. 113 Page 36
As Introduced
The estimates of quantities used for purposes of division 1026
(C)(2) of this section shall be estimated by the housing 1027
officer. Departures of the actual quantities from the estimates 1028
subsequent to approval of the application do not invalidate the 1029
application. 1030
(3) If a board of education has adopted a resolution 1031
waiving its right to approve applications under this division 1032
and that resolution remains in effect, approval of an 1033
application by the board is not required under division (C)(1) 1034

right to approve applications, the board shall certify a copy of 1036
the resolution to the housing officer. If the board rescinds 1037
such a resolution, it shall certify notice of the rescission to 1038
the housing officer. 1039

shall forward the application to the county auditor with a 1048
certification as to the division of this section under which the 1049
exemption is granted, and the period and percentage of the 1050
exemption as determined by the legislative authority pursuant to 1051
that division. If the construction or remodeling is of 1052
commercial or industrial property and the legislative authority 1053
is not required to certify a copy of a resolution under section 1054

Section 29:
3735.671 of the Revised Code, the housing officer shall comply 1055
H. B. No. 113 Page 37

the Revised Code, unless the board has adopted a resolution 1057
under that section waiving its right to receive such a notice. 1058
(D) Except as provided in division (F) of this section, 1059
the tax exemption shall first apply in the year the construction 1060
or remodeling would first be taxable but for this section. In 1061
the case of remodeling that qualifies for exemption, a 1062
percentage, not to exceed one hundred per cent, of the increased 1063
assessed valuation of an existing structure after remodeling 1064
began shall be exempted from real property taxation. In the case 1065
of construction of a structure that qualifies for exemption, a 1066
percentage, not to exceed one hundred per cent, of the assessed 1067
value of the structure shall be exempted from real property 1068
taxation. In either case, the percentage shall be the percentage 1069
set forth in the agreement if the structure or remodeling is to 1070
be used for commercial or industrial purposes, or the percentage 1071
set forth in the resolution describing the community 1072
reinvestment area if the structure or remodeling is to be used 1073
for residential purposes. 1074

structure located within the same community reinvestment area, a 1096
period to be determined by the legislative authority adopting 1097
the resolution, but not exceeding one of the following: 1098

(b) Fifteen years, for any other dwelling or commercial or 1106
industrial structure. 1107

requirements for exemption, the housing officer shall notify the 1119
county auditor, who shall correct the tax list and duplicate 1120
accordingly. 1121
(F) The owner of a dwelling constructed in a community 1122
reinvestment area may file an application for an exemption after 1123
the year the construction first became subject to taxation. The 1124
application shall be processed in accordance with the procedures 1125
prescribed under this section and shall be granted if the 1126
construction that is the subject of the application otherwise 1127
meets the requirements for an exemption under this section. If 1128
approved, the exemption sought in the application first applies 1129
in the year the application is filed. An exemption approved 1130
pursuant to this division continues only for those years 1131
remaining in the period described in division (D)(2) of this 1132

zoning regulations adopted under either Chapter 303. or 519. of 528
the Revised Code at the time the petition is filed, the 529
legislative authority of the municipal corporation also shall 530

petition is filed, the legislative authority of the municipal 561
corporation to which annexation is proposed and board of 562
township trustees of each township any portion of which is 563
included within the territory proposed for annexation may adopt 564
and file with the board of county commissioners an ordinance or 565

its journal a resolution denying the petition. If the municipal 574
corporation files a resolution under division (C)(2) agreeing to 575
consider the annexation and each of those townships timely files 576

H. B. No. 113 Page 21
As Introduced
an ordinance or a resolution consenting to the proposed 577
annexation, the board at its next regular session shall enter 578

if the board finds that, on balance, the general good of the 580
territory proposed to be annexed will be served, and the 581
benefits to the territory proposed to be annexed and the 582
surrounding area will outweigh the detriments to the territory 583
proposed to be annexed and the surrounding area, if the proposed 584
annexation is granted. If, instead the board finds the general 585
good is not served, the board shall enter upon its journal a 586
resolution denying the annexation. As used in this section, 587
"surrounding area" has the same meaning as in section 709.033 of 588
the Revised Code. 589

to the proposed annexation, the board of county commissioners 593
shall proceed as provided in division (E) of this section. 594
Failure of the municipal corporation to timely file its response 595
under division (C) of this section or any failure of those 596
townships to timely file an ordinance or a resolution consenting 597
or objecting to the proposed annexation shall be deemed to 598

the following conditions has been met: 606

H. B. No. 113 Page 22

and was filed in the manner provided in, section 709.021 of the 608

five two hundred acres. 614
(4) The territory proposed for annexation shares a 615
contiguous boundary with the municipal corporation to which 616

twenty per cent of the perimeter of the territory proposed for 618
annexation. 619
(5) The annexation will not create an unincorporated area 620
of the township that is completely surrounded by the territory 621
proposed for annexation. 622
(6) The municipal corporation to which annexation is 623

annexation the services specified in the relevant ordinance or 625
resolution adopted under division (C)(C)(2) of this section, 626
including all services generally available within the municipal 627
corporation's existing boundaries, or the municipal corporation 628
has completed agreements with the county, township, or other 629
political subdivision that demonstrate the ability to provide 630
required services in the future. 631
(7) If a street or highway will be divided or segmented by 632
the boundary line between the township and the municipal 633
corporation as to create a road maintenance problem, the 634
municipal corporation to which annexation is proposed has agreed 635

H. B. No. 113 Page 23
As Introduced
as a condition of the annexation to assume the maintenance of 636
that street or highway or to otherwise correct the problem. As 637
used in this section, "street" or "highway" has the same meaning 638
as in section 4511.01 of the Revised Code. 639
(8) On balance, the general good of the territory proposed 640
to be annexed will be served, and the benefits to the territory 641

of county commissioners, if it finds that each of the conditions 649
specified in division (E) of this section has been met, shall 650
enter upon its journal a resolution granting the annexation. If 651
the board of county commissioners finds that one or more of the 652
conditions specified in division (E) of this section have not 653

this section, the clerk of the board of county commissioners 658
shall proceed as provided in division (C)(1) of section 709.033 659
of the Revised Code, except that no recording or hearing 660

any party may seek a writ of mandamus to compel the board of 663
county commissioners to perform its duties under this section. 664
(H) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 665

As Introduced
503.07 of the Revised Code, and unless otherwise provided in an 666
annexation agreement entered into pursuant to section 709.192 of 667
the Revised Code or in a cooperative economic development 668
agreement entered into pursuant to section 701.07 of the Revised 669
Code, if township services continue to be provided within the 670
annexed territory, territory annexed into a municipal 671

real property taxes that support those services. 675
(I) Any owner of land that remains within a township and 676
that is adjacent to territory annexed pursuant to this section 677
who is directly affected by the failure of the annexing 678
municipal corporation to enforce compliance with any zoning 679
ordinance it adopts under division (C) of this section requiring 680
the owner of the annexed territory to provide a buffer zone, may 681
commence in the court of common pleas a civil action against 682
that owner to enforce compliance with that buffer requirement 683
whenever the required buffer is not in place before any 684
development of the annexed territory begins. 685
(J) Division (C)(18) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code 686
applies to the compensation paid to persons performing personal 687
services for a political subdivision on property owned by the 688
political subdivision after that property is annexed to a 689
municipal corporation under this section. 690

street or highway will be so divided or segmented, the municipal 830
corporation has agreed, as a condition of the annexation, that 831
it will assume the maintenance of that street or highway. For 832
the purposes of this division, "street" or "highway" has the 833
same meaning as in section 4511.01 of the Revised Code. 834
(4) The municipal corporation to which the territory is 835

valuation of an existing structure after remodeling began, if 958
the new structure or remodeling is completed after the effective 959

enter into a written agreement pursuant to section 3735.671 of 967
the Revised Code prior to commencement of construction or 968

prescribed by that section. 974
(B) The housing officer shall verify the construction of 975
the new structure or the cost of the remodeling of the existing 976
structure and the facts asserted in the application. The housing 977
officer shall determine whether the construction or remodeling 978
meets the requirements for an exemption under this section. In 979
cases involving a structure of historical or architectural 980
significance, the housing officer shall not determine whether 981
the remodeling meets the requirements for a tax exemption unless 982
the appropriateness of the remodeling has been certified, in 983
writing, by the society, association, agency, or legislative 984
authority that has designated the structure or by any 985
organization or person authorized, in writing, by such society, 986

board, shall approve or disapprove the application and certify a 997
copy of the resolution to the property owner and the housing 998
officer not later than forty-five days after the application is 999
certified to the board. The board may include in the resolution 1000
conditions under which the board would approve the application. 1001
The housing officer may approve an application at any time after 1002
the board certifies its resolution approving the application, 1003
or, if the board approves the application conditionally, at any 1004
time after the housing officer is notified that the conditions 1005
are agreed to by the board and the property owner. 1006
(2) Approval of an application by a board of education is 1007
not required under division (C)(1) of this section if, for each 1008
tax year the dwelling is exempted from taxation, the sum of the 1009
following quantities, as estimated at or prior to the time the 1010
application is formally approved by the housing officer, equals 1011
or exceeds twenty-five per cent of the amount of taxes, as 1012
estimated at or prior to that time, that would have been charged 1013
and payable that year upon the dwelling had that dwelling not 1014
been exempted from taxation: 1015
(a) The amount of taxes charged and payable on any portion 1016
of the assessed valuation of the new dwelling or of the 1017
increased assessed valuation of an existing dwelling after 1018
remodeling began that will not be exempted from taxation under 1019
the agreement; 1020
(b) The amount of any cash payment by the owner of the 1021
dwelling to the school district and any payment by the 1022
legislative authority that designated the community reinvestment 1023
area to the school district pursuant to section 5709.82 of the 1024

H. B. No. 113 Page 36
As Introduced
The estimates of quantities used for purposes of division 1026
(C)(2) of this section shall be estimated by the housing 1027
officer. Departures of the actual quantities from the estimates 1028
subsequent to approval of the application do not invalidate the 1029
application. 1030
(3) If a board of education has adopted a resolution 1031
waiving its right to approve applications under this division 1032
and that resolution remains in effect, approval of an 1033
application by the board is not required under division (C)(1) 1034
of this section. If a board adopts a resolution waiving its 1035
right to approve applications, the board shall certify a copy of 1036
the resolution to the housing officer. If the board rescinds 1037
such a resolution, it shall certify notice of the rescission to 1038
the housing officer. 1039

shall forward the application to the county auditor with a 1048
certification as to the division of this section under which the 1049
exemption is granted, and the period and percentage of the 1050
exemption as determined by the legislative authority pursuant to 1051
that division. If the construction or remodeling is of 1052
commercial or industrial property and the legislative authority 1053
is not required to certify a copy of a resolution under section 1054
3735.671 of the Revised Code, the housing officer shall comply 1055

H. B. No. 113 Page 37

the Revised Code, unless the board has adopted a resolution 1057
under that section waiving its right to receive such a notice. 1058
(D) Except as provided in division (F) of this section, 1059
the tax exemption shall first apply in the year the construction 1060
or remodeling would first be taxable but for this section. In 1061
the case of remodeling that qualifies for exemption, a 1062
percentage, not to exceed one hundred per cent, of the increased 1063
assessed valuation of an existing structure after remodeling 1064
began shall be exempted from real property taxation. In the case 1065
of construction of a structure that qualifies for exemption, a 1066
percentage, not to exceed one hundred per cent, of the assessed 1067
value of the structure shall be exempted from real property 1068
taxation. In either case, the percentage shall be the percentage 1069
set forth in the agreement if the structure or remodeling is to 1070
be used for commercial or industrial purposes, or the percentage 1071
set forth in the resolution describing the community 1072
reinvestment area if the structure or remodeling is to be used 1073
for residential purposes. 1074

properties, located within the same community reinvestment area, 1080
upon which the cost of remodeling is at least two thousand five 1081
hundred dollars in the case of a dwelling containing not more 1082

fifteen years. The period of exemption for a dwelling described 1086
in division (D)(1) of this section may be extended by a 1087
legislative authority for up to an additional ten years if the 1088
dwelling is a structure of historical or architectural 1089
significance, is a certified historic structure that has been 1090
subject to federal tax treatment under 26 U.S.C. 47 and 170(h), 1091

for construction of every dwelling, and commercial or industrial 1095
structure located within the same community reinvestment area, a 1096
period to be determined by the legislative authority adopting 1097
the resolution, but not exceeding one of the following: 1098
(a) Thirty years, if the commercial or industrial 1099
structure is situated on the site of a megaproject and is owned 1100
and occupied by a megaproject operator as defined in division 1101
(A)(12) of section 122.17 of the Revised Code, or is not 1102
situated on the site of a megaproject but is owned and occupied 1103
by a megaproject supplier that meets the requirements described 1104
in division (A)(13)(b) of section 122.17 of the Revised Code; 1105
(b) Fifteen years, for any other dwelling or commercial or 1106
industrial structure. 1107
(E) Any person, board, or officer authorized by section 1108
5715.19 of the Revised Code to file complaints with the county 1109
board of revision may file a complaint with the housing officer 1110
challenging the continued exemption of any property granted an 1111
exemption under this section. A complaint against exemption 1112
shall be filed prior to the thirty-first day of December of the 1113
tax year for which taxation of the property is requested. The 1114
housing officer shall determine whether the property continues 1115

to meet the requirements for exemption and shall certify the 1116
housing officer's findings to the complainant. If the housing 1117
officer determines that the property does not meet the 1118
requirements for exemption, the housing officer shall notify the 1119
county auditor, who shall correct the tax list and duplicate 1120
accordingly. 1121
(F) The owner of a dwelling constructed in a community 1122
reinvestment area may file an application for an exemption after 1123
the year the construction first became subject to taxation. The 1124
application shall be processed in accordance with the procedures 1125
prescribed under this section and shall be granted if the 1126
construction that is the subject of the application otherwise 1127
meets the requirements for an exemption under this section. If 1128
approved, the exemption sought in the application first applies 1129
in the year the application is filed. An exemption approved 1130
pursuant to this division continues only for those years 1131
remaining in the period described in division (D)(2) of this 1132
section. No exemption may be claimed for any year in that period 1133
that precedes the year in which the application is filed. 1134
Section 2. That existing sections 102.02, 709.022, 1135
709.023, 709.024, 709.16, and 3735.67 of the Revised Code are 1136
hereby repealed. 1137
Section 3. The changes to annexation proceedings under 1138
sections 709.022, 709.023, 709.024, and 709.16 of the Revised 1139
