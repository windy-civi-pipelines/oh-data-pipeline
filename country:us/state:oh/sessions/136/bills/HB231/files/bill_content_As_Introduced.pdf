(2) "Qualifying employer" means a taxpayer or a pass- 18
through entity who is registered and authorized to use the e- 19
verify federal employment verification program jointly 20

employees. 25
(3) "Parental leave benefits" means compensation paid to a 26
qualifying employee while the employee is on leave for a period 27
following the birth, stillbirth, or adoption of a child, 28
provided that the compensation is equal to the compensation the 29
employee would have received if the employee had worked for the 30
qualifying employer in the employee's job for that period and is 31

of the Revised Code. 35
(B) There is hereby allowed a nonrefundable credit against 36
a taxpayer's aggregate tax liability for a taxpayer who is a 37
qualifying employer, or who owns a direct or indirect interest 38

an employee for each birth, adoption, or stillbirth shall equal 41
the lesser of the amount of parental leave benefits paid to the 42
employee or three hundred dollars for each day of parental leave 43
benefits paid. 44
In the case of a taxpayer who is a qualifying employer, 45

this section per taxable year shall not exceed fifty four 55
thousand dollars. 56
(C) The credit shall be claimed in the order required 57

excess of the aggregate amount of tax due under section 5747.02 59
of the Revised Code, after allowing for any other credits 60
preceding the credit in that order, may be carried forward for 61
three taxable years, but the amount of the excess credit allowed 62
in any such year shall be deducted from the balance carried 63
forward to the next year. 64
(D) On or before September 1, 2026, and on the first day 65
of each September thereafter, the tax commissioner shall issue a 66
