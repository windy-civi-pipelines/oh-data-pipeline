BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF OHIO:
Section 1. That section 323.131 be amended and section 6

the form and contain the information required by the tax 10
commissioner. The commissioner may prescribe different forms for 11
each county and may authorize the county auditor to make up tax 12
bills and tax receipts to be used by the county treasurer. For 13
any county in which the board of county commissioners has 14
granted a partial property tax exemption on homesteads under 15
section 323.158 of the Revised Code, the commissioner shall 16
require that the tax bills for those homesteads include a notice 17

exemption. In addition to the information required by the 19
commissioner, each tax bill shall contain the following 20

information: 21
(1) The taxes levied and the taxes charged and payable 22
against the property; 23
(2) The effective tax rate. The words "effective tax rate" 24
shall appear in boldface type. 25
(3) The following notices: 26
(a) "Notice: If the taxes are not paid within sixty days 27
from the date they are certified delinquent, the property is 28
subject to foreclosure for tax delinquency." Failure to provide 29
such notice has no effect upon the validity of any tax 30
foreclosure to which a property is subjected. 31
(b) "Notice: If the taxes charged against this parcel have 32
been reduced by the 2-1/2 per cent tax reduction for residences 33
occupied by the owner but the property is not a residence 34
occupied by the owner, the owner must notify the county 35
auditor's office not later than March 31 of the year following 36
the year for which the taxes are due. Failure to do so may 37
result in the owner being convicted of a fourth degree 38
misdemeanor, which is punishable by imprisonment up to 30 days, 39
a fine up to $250, or both, and in the owner having to repay the 40
amount by which the taxes were erroneously or illegally reduced, 41
plus any interest that may apply. 42
If the taxes charged against this parcel have not been 43
reduced by the 2-1/2 per cent tax reduction and the parcel 44
includes a residence occupied by the owner, the parcel may 45
qualify for the tax reduction. To obtain an application for the 46
tax reduction or further information, the owner may contact the 47
county auditor's office at __________ (insert the address and 48
telephone number of the county auditor's office)." 49

list under section 319.48 of the Revised Code, the following 51
notice: "Notice: The taxes shown due on this bill are for the 52
current year only. Delinquent taxes, penalties, and interest 53
also are due on this property. Contact the county treasurer to 54

bill for the following tax year and an estimate of the projected 60
first-year collections of those taxes, based on values on the 61

The tax bill shall not contain or be mailed or delivered 63
with any information or material that is not required by this 64
section or that is not authorized by section 321.45 of the 65
Revised Code or by the tax commissioner. 66
(B) If the property is residential rental property, the 67
tax bill shall contain a statement that the owner of the 68
