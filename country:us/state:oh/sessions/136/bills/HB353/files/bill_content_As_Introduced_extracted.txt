enact an ordinance providing that a person between the age of 194
eighteen and forty may receive an original appointment to the 195
fire department, or the board of trustees of a civil service 196

prevent a municipal corporation or civil service township from 198
establishing a fire cadet program and employing persons as fire 199
cadets at age eighteen for the purpose of training persons to 200
become firefighters. The board of trustees of a civil service 201
township may establish by resolution such a cadet program. A 202

program shall not be permitted to carry or use any firearm in 204
the performance of the person's duties. 205

upon which the member's application for disability benefits is 666
based was caused or induced by the actual performance of the 667
member's official duties, and any recommendations or comments 668
based on the medical opinions; 669
(5) Taking into consideration the member's potential for 670

report if a physician reviews, approves, and signs the report 683

As used in this division: 685
"Totally disabled" means a member of the fund is unable to 686
perform the duties of any gainful occupation for which the 687
member is reasonably fitted by training, experience, and 688
accomplishments. Absolute helplessness is not a prerequisite of 689
being totally disabled. 690
"Permanently disabled" means a condition of disability 691
that is expected to last for a continuous period of not less 692
than twelve months after an application for disability benefits 693
is filed and from which there is no present indication of 694
recovery. 695
"Hazardous duty" has the same meaning as in 5 C.F.R. 696

Section 77:
550.902, as amended. 697
(1) A member of the fund who is permanently and totally 698
disabled as the result of the performance of the member's 699
official duties as a member of a police or fire department shall 700
be paid annual disability benefits in accordance with division 701
(A) of section 742.39 of the Revised Code. In determining 702
whether a member of the fund is permanently and totally 703
disabled, the board shall consider standards adopted under 704
division (C) of this section applicable to the determination. 705
(2) A member of the fund who is permanently and partially 706
disabled as the result of the performance of the member's 707
official duties as a member of a police or fire department 708
shall, if the disability prevents the member from performing 709
those duties and impairs the member's earning capacity, receive 710
annual disability benefits in accordance with division (B) of 711

As Introduced

Section 78:
section 742.39 of the Revised Code. In determining whether a 712
member of the fund is permanently and partially disabled, the 713
board shall consider standards adopted under division (C) of 714
this section applicable to the determination. 715
(3)(a) A member of the fund who is permanently disabled as 716
a result of heart disease or any cardiovascular or respiratory 717
disease of a chronic nature, which disease or any evidence of 718
which disease was not revealed by the physical examination 719
passed by the member on entry into the department or another 720
examination specified in rules the board adopts under section 721

Section 79:
742.10 of the Revised Code, is presumed to have incurred the 722
disease while performing the member's official duties, unless 723
the contrary is shown by competent evidence. The board may waive 724
the requirement that the absence of disease be evidenced by a 725
physical examination if competent medical evidence of a type 726
specified in rules adopted under section 742.10 of the Revised 727
Code is submitted documenting that the disease was not evident 728
prior to or at the time of entry into the department. 729
(b) A member of the fund who is a member of a fire 730
department, has been assigned to at least six years of hazardous 731
duty as a member of a fire department, and is disabled as a 732
result of cancer, is presumed to have incurred the cancer while 733
performing the member's official duties if the member was 734
exposed to an agent classified by the international agency for 735
research on cancer or its successor agency as a group 1 or 2A 736
carcinogen. 737
(c) The presumption described in division (D)(3)(b) of 738
this section is rebuttable in any of the following situations: 739
(i) There is evidence that the member incurred the type of 740
cancer being alleged before becoming a member of the department. 741
H. B. No. 353 Page 26
As Introduced
(ii) There is evidence that the member's exposure, outside 742
the scope of the member's official duties, to cigarettes, 743
tobacco products, or other conditions presenting an extremely 744
high risk for the development of the cancer alleged, was 745
probably a significant factor in the cause or progression of the 746

in a civil action for injury, death, or loss to person or 9454
property resulting from the individual's acts or omissions in 9455
the performance of any procedure, treatment, or other health 9456
care service if the individual reasonably believed that the 9457
physician assistant associate was acting within the proper scope 9458
of practice or was relaying medical orders from a supervising 9459
physician, unless the act or omission constitutes willful or 9460
wanton misconduct. 9461

Section 326:

court renders a final judgment in the license holder's favor and 9615
that judgment is based upon an adjudication on the merits. The 9616

hearing prior to the court's order to seal or expunge the 9627

consent to submit to a mental or physical examination when 9634
directed to do so in writing by the board and to have waived all 9635

reports that constitute a privileged communication. 9637
(1) In enforcing division (B)(4) of this section, the 9638
board, upon a showing of a possible violation, shall refer any 9639
individual who holds, or has applied for, a license issued under 9640
this chapter to the monitoring organization that conducts the 9641

confidential monitoring program established under section 9642

Section 327:
4731.25 of the Revised Code. The board also may compel the 9643
individual to submit to a mental examination, physical 9644
examination, including an HIV test, or both a mental and 9645
physical examination. The expense of the examination is the 9646
responsibility of the individual compelled to be examined. 9647
Failure to submit to a mental or physical examination or consent 9648
to an HIV test ordered by the board constitutes an admission of 9649
the allegations against the individual unless the failure is due 9650
to circumstances beyond the individual's control, and a default 9651
and final order may be entered without the taking of testimony 9652
or presentation of evidence. If the board finds a physician 9653
assistant associate unable to practice because of the reasons 9654
set forth in division (B)(4) of this section, the board shall 9655
require the physician assistant associate to submit to care, 9656
counseling, or treatment by physicians approved or designated by 9657
the board, as a condition for an initial, continued, reinstated, 9658
or renewed license. An individual affected under this division 9659
shall be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate to the board the 9660
ability to resume practicing in compliance with acceptable and 9661
prevailing standards of care. 9662
(2) For purposes of division (B)(5) of this section, if 9663
the board has reason to believe that any individual who holds a 9664
license issued under this chapter or any applicant for a license 9665
suffers such impairment, the board shall refer the individual to 9666
the monitoring organization that conducts the confidential 9667
monitoring program established under section 4731.25 of the 9668
Revised Code. The board also may compel the individual to submit 9669
to a mental or physical examination, or both. The expense of the 9670
examination is the responsibility of the individual compelled to 9671
be examined. Any mental or physical examination required under 9672
H. B. No. 353 Page 337
As Introduced
this division shall be undertaken by a treatment provider or 9673
physician qualified to conduct such examination and approved 9674
under section 4731.251 of the Revised Code. 9675
Failure to submit to a mental or physical examination 9676
ordered by the board constitutes an admission of the allegations 9677
against the individual unless the failure is due to 9678
circumstances beyond the individual's control, and a default and 9679
final order may be entered without the taking of testimony or 9680
presentation of evidence. If the board determines that the 9681
individual's ability to practice is impaired, the board shall 9682
suspend the individual's license or deny the individual's 9683
application and shall require the individual, as a condition for 9684
initial, continued, reinstated, or renewed licensure, to submit 9685
to treatment. 9686
Before being eligible to apply for reinstatement of a 9687
license suspended under this division, the physician assistant 9688
associate shall demonstrate to the board the ability to resume 9689
practice or prescribing in compliance with acceptable and 9690
prevailing standards of care. The demonstration shall include 9691
the following: 9692

successfully completed any required inpatient treatment; 9695
(b) Evidence of continuing full compliance with an 9696
aftercare contract or consent agreement; 9697
(c) Two written reports indicating that the individual's 9698
ability to practice has been assessed and that the individual 9699
has been found capable of practicing according to acceptable and 9700
prevailing standards of care. The reports shall be made by 9701
H. B. No. 353 Page 338
As Introduced
individuals or providers approved by the board for making such 9702
assessments and shall describe the basis for their 9703
determination. 9704
The board may reinstate a license suspended under this 9705
division after such demonstration and after the individual has 9706
entered into a written consent agreement. 9707
When the impaired physician assistant associate resumes 9708
practice or prescribing, the board shall require continued 9709
monitoring of the physician assistantassociate. The monitoring 9710
shall include compliance with the written consent agreement 9711
entered into before reinstatement or with conditions imposed by 9712
board order after a hearing, and, upon termination of the 9713
consent agreement, submission to the board for at least two 9714
years of annual written progress reports made under penalty of 9715
falsification stating whether the physician assistant associate 9716
has maintained sobriety. 9717
(G)(1) If either of the following circumstances occur, the 9718
secretary and supervising member may recommend that the board 9719
suspend the individual's license without a prior hearing: 9720
(a) The secretary and supervising member determine that 9721
there is clear and convincing evidence that a physician 9722
assistant associate has violated division (B) of this section 9723
and that the individual's continued practice or prescribing 9724
presents a danger of immediate and serious harm to the public. 9725
(b) The board receives verifiable information that a 9726
licensee has been charged in any state or federal court with a 9727
crime classified as a felony under the charging court's law and 9728
the conduct charged constitutes a violation of division (B) of 9729
this section. 9730

(2) If a recommendation is made to suspend without a prior 9731
hearing pursuant to division (G)(1) of this section, written 9732
allegations shall be prepared for consideration by the board. 9733
The board, upon review of those allegations and by an 9734
affirmative vote of not fewer than six of its members, excluding 9735
the secretary and supervising member, may suspend a license 9736
without a prior hearing. A telephone conference call may be 9737
utilized for reviewing the allegations and taking the vote on 9738
the summary suspension. 9739
The board shall serve a written order of suspension in 9740
accordance with sections 119.05 and 119.07 of the Revised Code. 9741
The order shall not be subject to suspension by the court during 9742
pendency of any appeal filed under section 119.12 of the Revised 9743
Code. If the physician assistant associate requests an 9744
adjudicatory hearing by the board, the date set for the hearing 9745
shall be within fifteen days, but not earlier than seven days, 9746

determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the 9925
complaint filed alleges a violation of this chapter or a rule 9926
adopted under it and that the records sought are relevant to the 9927
alleged violation and material to the investigation. The 9928
subpoena may apply only to records that cover a reasonable 9929

On failure to comply with any subpoena issued by the board 9931
and after reasonable notice to the person being subpoenaed, the 9932
board may move for an order compelling the production of persons 9933

any civil action. 9954
The board shall conduct all investigations and proceedings 9955
in a manner that protects the confidentiality of patients and 9956
persons who file complaints with the board. The board shall not 9957
make public the names or any other identifying information about 9958
patients or complainants unless proper consent is given or, in 9959
the case of a patient, a waiver of the patient privilege exists 9960
under division (B) of section 2317.02 of the Revised Code, 9961
except that consent or a waiver is not required if the board 9962
possesses reliable and substantial evidence that no bona fide 9963
physician-patient relationship exists. 9964

regarding confidentiality as those with which the state medical 9972
board must comply, notwithstanding any conflicting provision of 9973
the Revised Code or procedure of the agency or board that 9974
applies when it is dealing with other information in its 9975
possession. In a judicial proceeding, the information may be 9976
admitted into evidence only in accordance with the Rules of 9977
Evidence, but the court shall require that appropriate measures 9978
are taken to ensure that confidentiality is maintained with 9979
respect to any part of the information that contains names or 9980
other identifying information about patients or complainants 9981
whose confidentiality was protected by the state medical board 9982
when the information was in the board's possession. Measures to 9983
ensure confidentiality that may be taken by the court include 9984
sealing its records or deleting specific information from its 9985
records. 9986
No person shall knowingly access, use, or disclose 9987
confidential investigatory information in a manner prohibited by 9988
law. 9989

responsibility of the individual compelled to be examined. 11230
Failure to submit to a mental or physical examination or consent 11231

certification to practice suffers such impairment, the board 11321
shall refer the individual to the monitoring organization that 11322

examination required under this division shall be undertaken by 11328
a treatment provider or physician who is qualified to conduct 11329
the examination and who is approved under section 4731.251 of 11330

against the individual unless the failure is due to 11334
circumstances beyond the individual's control, and a default and 11335
final order may be entered without the taking of testimony or 11336
presentation of evidence. If the board determines that the 11337
individual's ability to practice is impaired, the board shall 11338
suspend the individual's license or certificate or deny the 11339
individual's application and shall require the individual, as a 11340
condition for initial, continued, reinstated, or renewed 11341
licensure or certification to practice, to submit to treatment. 11342
Before being eligible to apply for reinstatement of a 11343
license or certificate suspended under this division, the 11344

individuals or providers approved by the board for making the 11359
assessments and shall describe the basis for their 11360
determination. 11361
The board may reinstate a license or certificate suspended 11362
under this division after that demonstration and after the 11363
individual has entered into a written consent agreement. 11364
When the impaired practitioner resumes practice, the board 11365
shall require continued monitoring of the individual. The 11366
monitoring shall include, but not be limited to, compliance with 11367
the written consent agreement entered into before reinstatement 11368

action under this section if, based upon a plea of guilty, a 11535
judicial finding of guilt, or a judicial finding of eligibility 11536
for intervention in lieu of conviction, the board issued a 11537
notice of opportunity for a hearing prior to the court's order 11538
to seal or expunge the records. The board shall not be required 11539
to seal, expunge, destroy, redact, or otherwise modify its 11540
records to reflect the court's sealing of conviction records. 11541
(F)(1) The board shall investigate evidence that appears 11542
to show that a person has violated any provision of this chapter 11543
or any rule adopted under it. Any person may report to the board 11544
in a signed writing any information that the person may have 11545

Section 403:
section 4731.02 of the Revised Code and by the secretary as 11558

investigation in place of the supervising member. Upon a vote of 11561
the majority of the board to authorize the addition of a 11562
consumer member in the supervision of any part of any 11563
investigation, the president shall designate a consumer member 11564
for supervision of investigations as determined by the 11565
president. The authorization of consumer member participation in 11566
investigation supervision may be rescinded by a majority vote of 11567
the board. No member of the board who supervises the 11568
investigation of a case shall participate in further 11569
adjudication of the case. 11570
(3) In investigating a possible violation of this chapter 11571
or any rule adopted under this chapter, or in conducting an 11572

Code, the board may question witnesses, conduct interviews, 11574
administer oaths, order the taking of depositions, inspect and 11575
copy any books, accounts, papers, records, or documents, issue 11576
subpoenas, and compel the attendance of witnesses and production 11577

except that a subpoena for patient record information shall not 11579
be issued without consultation with the attorney general's 11580
office and approval of the secretary of the board. 11581
(a) Before issuance of a subpoena for patient record 11582
information, the secretary shall determine whether there is 11583
probable cause to believe that the complaint filed alleges a 11584
violation of this chapter or any rule adopted under it and that 11585
the records sought are relevant to the alleged violation and 11586
material to the investigation. The subpoena may apply only to 11587
records that cover a reasonable period of time surrounding the 11588
alleged violation. 11589
(b) On failure to comply with any subpoena issued by the 11590

board and after reasonable notice to the person being 11591
subpoenaed, the board may move for an order compelling the 11592
production of persons or records pursuant to the Rules of Civil 11593
Procedure. 11594
(c) A subpoena issued by the board may be served by a 11595
sheriff, the sheriff's deputy, or a board employee or agent 11596
designated by the board. Service of a subpoena issued by the 11597
board may be made by delivering a copy of the subpoena to the 11598
person named therein, reading it to the person, or leaving it at 11599
the person's usual place of residence, usual place of business, 11600
or address on file with the board. When serving a subpoena to an 11601
applicant for or the holder of a license or certificate issued 11602
under this chapter, service of the subpoena may be made by 11603
certified mail, return receipt requested, and the subpoena shall 11604
be deemed served on the date delivery is made or the date the 11605
person refuses to accept delivery. If the person being served 11606
refuses to accept the subpoena or is not located, service may be 11607
made to an attorney who notifies the board that the attorney is 11608
representing the person. 11609
(d) A sheriff's deputy who serves a subpoena shall receive 11610
the same fees as a sheriff. Each witness who appears before the 11611
board in obedience to a subpoena shall receive the fees and 11612
mileage provided for under section 119.094 of the Revised Code. 11613
(4) All hearings, investigations, and inspections of the 11614
board shall be considered civil actions for the purposes of 11615

Section 404:

confidential and not subject to discovery in any civil action. 11621
The board shall conduct all investigations or inspections 11622
and proceedings in a manner that protects the confidentiality of 11623
patients and persons who file complaints with the board. The 11624
board shall not make public the names or any other identifying 11625
information about patients or complainants unless proper consent 11626
is given or, in the case of a patient, a waiver of the patient 11627
privilege exists under division (B) of section 2317.02 of the 11628
Revised Code, except that consent or a waiver of that nature is 11629
not required if the board possesses reliable and substantial 11630
evidence that no bona fide physician-patient relationship 11631
exists. 11632
The board may share any information it receives pursuant 11633
to an investigation or inspection, including patient records and 11634
patient record information, with law enforcement agencies, other 11635
licensing boards, and other governmental agencies that are 11636
prosecuting, adjudicating, or investigating alleged violations 11637
of statutes or administrative rules. An agency or board that 11638
receives the information shall comply with the same requirements 11639
regarding confidentiality as those with which the state medical 11640
board must comply, notwithstanding any conflicting provision of 11641
the Revised Code or procedure of the agency or board that 11642
applies when it is dealing with other information in its 11643
possession. In a judicial proceeding, the information may be 11644
admitted into evidence only in accordance with the Rules of 11645
Evidence, but the court shall require that appropriate measures 11646
are taken to ensure that confidentiality is maintained with 11647
respect to any part of the information that contains names or 11648
other identifying information about patients or complainants 11649
whose confidentiality was protected by the state medical board 11650
when the information was in the board's possession. Measures to 11651
H. B. No. 353 Page 405

ensure confidentiality that may be taken by the court include 11652
sealing its records or deleting specific information from its 11653
records. 11654
No person shall knowingly access, use, or disclose 11655
confidential investigatory information in a manner prohibited by 11656
law. 11657
(6) On a quarterly basis, the board shall prepare a report 11658
that documents the disposition of all cases during the preceding 11659
three months. The report shall contain the following information 11660
for each case with which the board has completed its activities: 11661
(a) The case number assigned to the complaint or alleged 11662
violation; 11663
(b) The type of license or certificate to practice, if 11664
any, held by the individual against whom the complaint is 11665

(f) The disposition of the case. 11672
The report shall state how many cases are still pending 11673
and shall be prepared in a manner that protects the identity of 11674
each person involved in each case. The report shall be a public 11675
record under section 149.43 of the Revised Code. 11676
(7) The board may provide a status update regarding an 11677
investigation to a complainant on request if the board verifies 11678

(G)(1) If either of the following circumstances occur, the 11680
secretary and supervising member may recommend that the board 11681
suspend an individual's license or certificate to practice or 11682
certificate to recommend without a prior hearing: 11683
(a) The secretary and supervising member determine both of 11684
the following: 11685
(i) That there is clear and convincing evidence that an 11686
individual has violated division (B) of this section; 11687
(ii) That the individual's continued practice presents a 11688
danger of immediate and serious harm to the public. 11689
(b) The board receives verifiable information that a 11690
licensee has been charged in any state or federal court with a 11691
crime classified as a felony under the charging court's law and 11692
the conduct constitutes a violation of division (B) of this 11693

Section 405:
section. 11694
(2) If a recommendation is made to suspend without a prior 11695
hearing pursuant to division (G)(1) of this section, written 11696
allegations shall be prepared for consideration by the board. 11697
The board, upon review of those allegations and by an 11698
affirmative vote of not fewer than six of its members, excluding 11699
the secretary and supervising member, may suspend a license or 11700
certificate without a prior hearing. A telephone conference call 11701
may be utilized for reviewing the allegations and taking the 11702
vote on the summary suspension. 11703
The board shall serve a written order of suspension in 11704
accordance with sections 119.05 and 119.07 of the Revised Code. 11705
The order shall not be subject to suspension by the court during 11706

requests an adjudicatory hearing by the board, the date set for 11709
the hearing shall be within fifteen days, but not earlier than 11710
seven days, after the individual requests the hearing, unless 11711
otherwise agreed to by both the board and the individual. 11712
(3) Any summary suspension imposed under this division 11713
shall remain in effect, unless reversed on appeal, until a final 11714
adjudicative order issued by the board pursuant to this section 11715
and Chapter 119. of the Revised Code becomes effective. The 11716
board shall issue its final adjudicative order within seventy- 11717
five days after completion of its hearing. A failure to issue 11718
the order within seventy-five days shall result in dissolution 11719
of the summary suspension order but shall not invalidate any 11720
subsequent, final adjudicative order. 11721
(H) If the board takes action under division (B)(9), (11), 11722
or (13) of this section and the judicial finding of guilt, 11723
guilty plea, or judicial finding of eligibility for intervention 11724
in lieu of conviction is overturned on appeal, upon exhaustion 11725
of the criminal appeal, a petition for reconsideration of the 11726
order may be filed with the board along with appropriate court 11727
documents. Upon receipt of a petition of that nature and 11728
supporting court documents, the board shall reinstate the 11729
individual's license or certificate to practice. The board may 11730
then hold an adjudication under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code 11731
to determine whether the individual committed the act in 11732
question. Notice of an opportunity for a hearing shall be given 11733
in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code. If the 11734
board finds, pursuant to an adjudication held under this 11735
division, that the individual committed the act or if no hearing 11736
is requested, the board may order any of the sanctions 11737
identified under division (B) of this section. 11738

of the state highway patrol shall, by rule, define those 14097

occupational injury leave. The individual selected to conduct 14130
the medical examinations shall report to the superintendent the 14131
results of each such examination, including a description of the 14132

examination or if the individual examining the patrol officer 14143
reports that the independent injury does not prevent the patrol 14144
officer from attending work. 14145
A patrol officer who falsifies an application for 14146
permission to use occupational injury leave or a medical 14147
examination report is subject to disciplinary action, including 14148
dismissal. 14149
The superintendent shall, by rule, prescribe forms for the 14150
application and medical examination report. 14151

ceases to receive the patrol officer's regular rate of pay 14164

H. B. No. 353 Page 5
As Introduced
the state only may be reinstated with the consent of the 113

this section does not apply to a city in which an ordinance 155
establishes a different maximum age limitation for an original 156
appointment to the police department or to a civil service 157
township in which a resolution adopted by the board of trustees 158
of the township establishes a different maximum age limitation 159

Nothing in this section shall prevent a municipal 161
corporation or a civil service township from establishing a 162
police cadet program and employing persons as police cadets at 163
age eighteen for the purposes of training persons to become 164
police officers. The board of trustees of a civil service 165
township may establish by resolution such a cadet program. A 166
person participating in a municipal or township police cadet 167
program shall not be permitted to carry or use any firearm in 168
the performance of the person's duties, except that the person 169
may be taught the proper use of firearms as part of the person's 170
training. 171
Sec. 124.42. No person shall be eligible to receive an 172

person has reached the age of eighteen and has, not more than 175
one hundred twenty days prior to receiving such appointment, 176
passed a physical examination, given by a licensed physician, a 177
physician assistantassociate, a clinical nurse specialist, a 178
certified nurse practitioner, or a certified nurse-midwife, 179
certifying that the applicant is free of cardiovascular and 180
pulmonary diseases, and showing that the person meets the 181
physical requirements necessary to perform the duties of a 182
firefighter as established by the civil service commission 183
having jurisdiction over the appointment. The appointing 184
authority shall, prior to making any such appointment, file with 185
the Ohio police and fire pension fund a copy of the report or 186
findings of said licensed physician, physician 187
assistantassociate, clinical nurse specialist, certified nurse 188
practitioner, or certified nurse-midwife. The professional fee 189
for such physical examination shall be paid by the civil service 190
commission. No person shall be eligible to receive an original 191
appointment on and after the person's forty-first birthday. 192
Notwithstanding this section, a municipal council may 193
enact an ordinance providing that a person between the age of 194
eighteen and forty may receive an original appointment to the 195
fire department, or the board of trustees of a civil service 196
township may do so by resolution. Nothing in this section shall 197
prevent a municipal corporation or civil service township from 198
establishing a fire cadet program and employing persons as fire 199
cadets at age eighteen for the purpose of training persons to 200
become firefighters. The board of trustees of a civil service 201
township may establish by resolution such a cadet program. A 202
person participating in a municipal or township fire cadet 203
program shall not be permitted to carry or use any firearm in 204
the performance of the person's duties. 205

H. B. No. 353 Page 8
As Introduced
Sec. 124.50. Any person holding an office or position 206
under the classified service in a fire department or a police 207
department who is separated therefrom due to injury or physical 208
disability incurred in the performance of duty shall be 209
reinstated immediately, or one suffering injury or physical 210
disability incurred other than in the performance of duty may be 211
reinstated, upon filing with the chief of the fire department or 212
the chief of the police department, a written application for 213
reinstatement, to the office or position held at the time of 214
such separation, after passing a physical examination showing 215
that the person has recovered from the injury or other physical 216
disability. The physical examination shall be made by a licensed 217
physician, a physician assistantassociate, a clinical nurse 218

the board. 9428
Sec. 4730.22. (A) When performing authorized services, a 9429
physician assistant associate acts as the agent of the physician 9430

(B) When a health care facility permits physician 9437
assistants associates to practice within that facility or any 9438
other health care facility under its control, the health care 9439
facility shall make reasonable efforts to explain to each 9440
individual who may work with a particular physician assistant 9441
associate the scope of that physician assistant's associate's 9442
practice within the facility. The appropriate credentialing body 9443

governs that individual's conduct and is not liable in damages 9453
in a civil action for injury, death, or loss to person or 9454
property resulting from the individual's acts or omissions in 9455
the performance of any procedure, treatment, or other health 9456
care service if the individual reasonably believed that the 9457
physician assistant associate was acting within the proper scope 9458
of practice or was relaying medical orders from a supervising 9459
physician, unless the act or omission constitutes willful or 9460
wanton misconduct. 9461

119. of the Revised Code, that the applicant or license holder 9612

court renders a final judgment in the license holder's favor and 9615
that judgment is based upon an adjudication on the merits. The 9616

any court shall have no effect upon a prior board order entered 9621

a judicial finding of eligibility for intervention in lieu of 9625
conviction, the board issued a notice of opportunity for a 9626
hearing prior to the court's order to seal or expunge the 9627

license issued under this chapter, shall be deemed to have given 9633
consent to submit to a mental or physical examination when 9634
directed to do so in writing by the board and to have waived all 9635

reports that constitute a privileged communication. 9637
(1) In enforcing division (B)(4) of this section, the 9638
board, upon a showing of a possible violation, shall refer any 9639

confidential monitoring program established under section 9642
4731.25 of the Revised Code. The board also may compel the 9643
individual to submit to a mental examination, physical 9644
examination, including an HIV test, or both a mental and 9645
physical examination. The expense of the examination is the 9646
responsibility of the individual compelled to be examined. 9647
Failure to submit to a mental or physical examination or consent 9648
to an HIV test ordered by the board constitutes an admission of 9649
the allegations against the individual unless the failure is due 9650
to circumstances beyond the individual's control, and a default 9651
and final order may be entered without the taking of testimony 9652
or presentation of evidence. If the board finds a physician 9653
assistant associate unable to practice because of the reasons 9654
set forth in division (B)(4) of this section, the board shall 9655
require the physician assistant associate to submit to care, 9656
counseling, or treatment by physicians approved or designated by 9657
the board, as a condition for an initial, continued, reinstated, 9658
or renewed license. An individual affected under this division 9659
shall be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate to the board the 9660
ability to resume practicing in compliance with acceptable and 9661
prevailing standards of care. 9662
(2) For purposes of division (B)(5) of this section, if 9663
the board has reason to believe that any individual who holds a 9664
license issued under this chapter or any applicant for a license 9665
suffers such impairment, the board shall refer the individual to 9666
the monitoring organization that conducts the confidential 9667
monitoring program established under section 4731.25 of the 9668
Revised Code. The board also may compel the individual to submit 9669
to a mental or physical examination, or both. The expense of the 9670
examination is the responsibility of the individual compelled to 9671
be examined. Any mental or physical examination required under 9672

H. B. No. 353 Page 337
As Introduced
this division shall be undertaken by a treatment provider or 9673
physician qualified to conduct such examination and approved 9674
under section 4731.251 of the Revised Code. 9675
Failure to submit to a mental or physical examination 9676
ordered by the board constitutes an admission of the allegations 9677
against the individual unless the failure is due to 9678
circumstances beyond the individual's control, and a default and 9679
final order may be entered without the taking of testimony or 9680
presentation of evidence. If the board determines that the 9681
individual's ability to practice is impaired, the board shall 9682
suspend the individual's license or deny the individual's 9683
application and shall require the individual, as a condition for 9684
initial, continued, reinstated, or renewed licensure, to submit 9685
to treatment. 9686
Before being eligible to apply for reinstatement of a 9687
license suspended under this division, the physician assistant 9688
associate shall demonstrate to the board the ability to resume 9689
practice or prescribing in compliance with acceptable and 9690
prevailing standards of care. The demonstration shall include 9691
the following: 9692
(a) Certification from a treatment provider approved under 9693
section 4731.251 of the Revised Code that the individual has 9694
successfully completed any required inpatient treatment; 9695
(b) Evidence of continuing full compliance with an 9696
aftercare contract or consent agreement; 9697
(c) Two written reports indicating that the individual's 9698
ability to practice has been assessed and that the individual 9699
has been found capable of practicing according to acceptable and 9700
prevailing standards of care. The reports shall be made by 9701

H. B. No. 353 Page 338

individuals or providers approved by the board for making such 9702
assessments and shall describe the basis for their 9703
determination. 9704
The board may reinstate a license suspended under this 9705
division after such demonstration and after the individual has 9706
entered into a written consent agreement. 9707
When the impaired physician assistant associate resumes 9708
practice or prescribing, the board shall require continued 9709
monitoring of the physician assistantassociate. The monitoring 9710
shall include compliance with the written consent agreement 9711
entered into before reinstatement or with conditions imposed by 9712
board order after a hearing, and, upon termination of the 9713
consent agreement, submission to the board for at least two 9714
years of annual written progress reports made under penalty of 9715
falsification stating whether the physician assistant associate 9716
has maintained sobriety. 9717
(G)(1) If either of the following circumstances occur, the 9718
secretary and supervising member may recommend that the board 9719
suspend the individual's license without a prior hearing: 9720
(a) The secretary and supervising member determine that 9721
there is clear and convincing evidence that a physician 9722
assistant associate has violated division (B) of this section 9723
and that the individual's continued practice or prescribing 9724
presents a danger of immediate and serious harm to the public. 9725
(b) The board receives verifiable information that a 9726
licensee has been charged in any state or federal court with a 9727
crime classified as a felony under the charging court's law and 9728
the conduct charged constitutes a violation of division (B) of 9729
this section. 9730

(2) If a recommendation is made to suspend without a prior 9731
hearing pursuant to division (G)(1) of this section, written 9732
allegations shall be prepared for consideration by the board. 9733
The board, upon review of those allegations and by an 9734
affirmative vote of not fewer than six of its members, excluding 9735
the secretary and supervising member, may suspend a license 9736
without a prior hearing. A telephone conference call may be 9737
utilized for reviewing the allegations and taking the vote on 9738
the summary suspension. 9739
The board shall serve a written order of suspension in 9740
accordance with sections 119.05 and 119.07 of the Revised Code. 9741
The order shall not be subject to suspension by the court during 9742
pendency of any appeal filed under section 119.12 of the Revised 9743
Code. If the physician assistant associate requests an 9744
adjudicatory hearing by the board, the date set for the hearing 9745
shall be within fifteen days, but not earlier than seven days, 9746
after the physician assistant associate requests the hearing, 9747
unless otherwise agreed to by both the board and the license 9748
holder. 9749
(3) A summary suspension imposed under this division shall 9750
remain in effect, unless reversed on appeal, until a final 9751
adjudicative order issued by the board pursuant to this section 9752
and Chapter 119. of the Revised Code becomes effective. The 9753
board shall issue its final adjudicative order within seventy- 9754
five days after completion of its hearing. Failure to issue the 9755
order within seventy-five days shall result in dissolution of 9756
the summary suspension order, but shall not invalidate any 9757
subsequent, final adjudicative order. 9758
(H) If the board takes action under division (B)(11), 9759
(13), or (14) of this section, and the judicial finding of 9760

H. B. No. 353 Page 340

guilt, guilty plea, or judicial finding of eligibility for 9761
intervention in lieu of conviction is overturned on appeal, upon 9762
exhaustion of the criminal appeal, a petition for 9763
reconsideration of the order may be filed with the board along 9764
with appropriate court documents. Upon receipt of a petition and 9765
supporting court documents, the board shall reinstate the 9766
individual's license. The board may then hold an adjudication 9767
under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code to determine whether the 9768
individual committed the act in question. Notice of opportunity 9769
for hearing shall be given in accordance with Chapter 119. of 9770
the Revised Code. If the board finds, pursuant to an 9771
adjudication held under this division, that the individual 9772

determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the 9925
complaint filed alleges a violation of this chapter or a rule 9926
adopted under it and that the records sought are relevant to the 9927

any civil action. 9954
The board shall conduct all investigations and proceedings 9955
in a manner that protects the confidentiality of patients and 9956
persons who file complaints with the board. The board shall not 9957
make public the names or any other identifying information about 9958
patients or complainants unless proper consent is given or, in 9959
the case of a patient, a waiver of the patient privilege exists 9960
under division (B) of section 2317.02 of the Revised Code, 9961
except that consent or a waiver is not required if the board 9962
possesses reliable and substantial evidence that no bona fide 9963
physician-patient relationship exists. 9964

regarding confidentiality as those with which the state medical 9972
board must comply, notwithstanding any conflicting provision of 9973
the Revised Code or procedure of the agency or board that 9974
applies when it is dealing with other information in its 9975
possession. In a judicial proceeding, the information may be 9976
admitted into evidence only in accordance with the Rules of 9977
Evidence, but the court shall require that appropriate measures 9978
are taken to ensure that confidentiality is maintained with 9979
respect to any part of the information that contains names or 9980
other identifying information about patients or complainants 9981
whose confidentiality was protected by the state medical board 9982
when the information was in the board's possession. Measures to 9983
ensure confidentiality that may be taken by the court include 9984
sealing its records or deleting specific information from its 9985
records. 9986
No person shall knowingly access, use, or disclose 9987
confidential investigatory information in a manner prohibited by 9988
law. 9989

the individual to submit to a mental examination, physical 11227
examination, including an HIV test, or both a mental and a 11228
physical examination. The expense of the examination is the 11229
responsibility of the individual compelled to be examined. 11230
Failure to submit to a mental or physical examination or consent 11231
to an HIV test ordered by the board constitutes an admission of 11232
the allegations against the individual unless the failure is due 11233
to circumstances beyond the individual's control, and a default 11234

affected under this division shall be afforded an opportunity to 11242
demonstrate to the board the ability to resume practice in 11243
compliance with acceptable and prevailing standards under the 11244

For the purposes of this division, any individual 11310
authorized to practice by this chapter accepts the privilege of 11311
practicing in this state subject to supervision by the board. By 11312
filing an application for or holding a license or certificate to 11313

have given consent to submit to a mental or physical examination 11315
when ordered to do so by the board in writing, and to have 11316
waived all objections to the admissibility of testimony or 11317
examination reports that constitute privileged communications. 11318
If it has reason to believe that any individual authorized 11319
to practice by this chapter or any applicant for licensure or 11320
certification to practice suffers such impairment, the board 11321
shall refer the individual to the monitoring organization that 11322
conducts the confidential monitoring program established under 11323
section 4731.25 of the Revised Code. The board also may compel 11324

the individual to submit to a mental or physical examination, or 11325
both. The expense of the examination is the responsibility of 11326
the individual compelled to be examined. Any mental or physical 11327
examination required under this division shall be undertaken by 11328
a treatment provider or physician who is qualified to conduct 11329
the examination and who is approved under section 4731.251 of 11330
the Revised Code. 11331
Failure to submit to a mental or physical examination 11332
ordered by the board constitutes an admission of the allegations 11333
against the individual unless the failure is due to 11334
circumstances beyond the individual's control, and a default and 11335
final order may be entered without the taking of testimony or 11336
presentation of evidence. If the board determines that the 11337
individual's ability to practice is impaired, the board shall 11338
suspend the individual's license or certificate or deny the 11339
individual's application and shall require the individual, as a 11340
condition for initial, continued, reinstated, or renewed 11341
licensure or certification to practice, to submit to treatment. 11342
Before being eligible to apply for reinstatement of a 11343
license or certificate suspended under this division, the 11344
impaired practitioner shall demonstrate to the board the ability 11345
to resume practice in compliance with acceptable and prevailing 11346
standards of care under the provisions of the practitioner's 11347
license or certificate. The demonstration shall include, but 11348
shall not be limited to, the following: 11349

individuals or providers approved by the board for making the 11359
assessments and shall describe the basis for their 11360
determination. 11361
The board may reinstate a license or certificate suspended 11362
under this division after that demonstration and after the 11363
individual has entered into a written consent agreement. 11364
When the impaired practitioner resumes practice, the board 11365
shall require continued monitoring of the individual. The 11366
monitoring shall include, but not be limited to, compliance with 11367
the written consent agreement entered into before reinstatement 11368
or with conditions imposed by board order after a hearing, and, 11369

judicial finding of guilt, or a judicial finding of eligibility 11536
for intervention in lieu of conviction, the board issued a 11537
notice of opportunity for a hearing prior to the court's order 11538
to seal or expunge the records. The board shall not be required 11539
to seal, expunge, destroy, redact, or otherwise modify its 11540
records to reflect the court's sealing of conviction records. 11541
(F)(1) The board shall investigate evidence that appears 11542
to show that a person has violated any provision of this chapter 11543

supervising member elected by the board in accordance with 11557
section 4731.02 of the Revised Code and by the secretary as 11558
provided in section 4731.39 of the Revised Code. The president 11559

investigation in place of the supervising member. Upon a vote of 11561
the majority of the board to authorize the addition of a 11562
consumer member in the supervision of any part of any 11563
investigation, the president shall designate a consumer member 11564
for supervision of investigations as determined by the 11565
president. The authorization of consumer member participation in 11566
investigation supervision may be rescinded by a majority vote of 11567
the board. No member of the board who supervises the 11568
investigation of a case shall participate in further 11569
adjudication of the case. 11570
(3) In investigating a possible violation of this chapter 11571
or any rule adopted under this chapter, or in conducting an 11572

Code, the board may question witnesses, conduct interviews, 11574
administer oaths, order the taking of depositions, inspect and 11575
copy any books, accounts, papers, records, or documents, issue 11576
subpoenas, and compel the attendance of witnesses and production 11577

except that a subpoena for patient record information shall not 11579
be issued without consultation with the attorney general's 11580
office and approval of the secretary of the board. 11581
(a) Before issuance of a subpoena for patient record 11582
information, the secretary shall determine whether there is 11583
probable cause to believe that the complaint filed alleges a 11584
violation of this chapter or any rule adopted under it and that 11585
the records sought are relevant to the alleged violation and 11586
material to the investigation. The subpoena may apply only to 11587
records that cover a reasonable period of time surrounding the 11588
alleged violation. 11589
(b) On failure to comply with any subpoena issued by the 11590

board and after reasonable notice to the person being 11591
subpoenaed, the board may move for an order compelling the 11592
production of persons or records pursuant to the Rules of Civil 11593
Procedure. 11594
(c) A subpoena issued by the board may be served by a 11595
sheriff, the sheriff's deputy, or a board employee or agent 11596
designated by the board. Service of a subpoena issued by the 11597
board may be made by delivering a copy of the subpoena to the 11598
person named therein, reading it to the person, or leaving it at 11599
the person's usual place of residence, usual place of business, 11600
or address on file with the board. When serving a subpoena to an 11601
applicant for or the holder of a license or certificate issued 11602
under this chapter, service of the subpoena may be made by 11603
certified mail, return receipt requested, and the subpoena shall 11604
be deemed served on the date delivery is made or the date the 11605
person refuses to accept delivery. If the person being served 11606
refuses to accept the subpoena or is not located, service may be 11607
made to an attorney who notifies the board that the attorney is 11608
representing the person. 11609
(d) A sheriff's deputy who serves a subpoena shall receive 11610
the same fees as a sheriff. Each witness who appears before the 11611
board in obedience to a subpoena shall receive the fees and 11612
mileage provided for under section 119.094 of the Revised Code. 11613
(4) All hearings, investigations, and inspections of the 11614
board shall be considered civil actions for the purposes of 11615
section 2305.252 of the Revised Code. 11616
(5) A report required to be submitted to the board under 11617
this chapter, a complaint, or information received by the board 11618

confidential and not subject to discovery in any civil action. 11621
The board shall conduct all investigations or inspections 11622
and proceedings in a manner that protects the confidentiality of 11623
patients and persons who file complaints with the board. The 11624
board shall not make public the names or any other identifying 11625
information about patients or complainants unless proper consent 11626
is given or, in the case of a patient, a waiver of the patient 11627
privilege exists under division (B) of section 2317.02 of the 11628
Revised Code, except that consent or a waiver of that nature is 11629
not required if the board possesses reliable and substantial 11630
evidence that no bona fide physician-patient relationship 11631
exists. 11632
The board may share any information it receives pursuant 11633
to an investigation or inspection, including patient records and 11634
patient record information, with law enforcement agencies, other 11635
licensing boards, and other governmental agencies that are 11636
prosecuting, adjudicating, or investigating alleged violations 11637
of statutes or administrative rules. An agency or board that 11638
receives the information shall comply with the same requirements 11639
regarding confidentiality as those with which the state medical 11640
board must comply, notwithstanding any conflicting provision of 11641
the Revised Code or procedure of the agency or board that 11642
applies when it is dealing with other information in its 11643
possession. In a judicial proceeding, the information may be 11644
admitted into evidence only in accordance with the Rules of 11645
Evidence, but the court shall require that appropriate measures 11646
are taken to ensure that confidentiality is maintained with 11647
respect to any part of the information that contains names or 11648
other identifying information about patients or complainants 11649
whose confidentiality was protected by the state medical board 11650
when the information was in the board's possession. Measures to 11651

H. B. No. 353 Page 405

ensure confidentiality that may be taken by the court include 11652
sealing its records or deleting specific information from its 11653
records. 11654
No person shall knowingly access, use, or disclose 11655
confidential investigatory information in a manner prohibited by 11656
law. 11657
(6) On a quarterly basis, the board shall prepare a report 11658
that documents the disposition of all cases during the preceding 11659
three months. The report shall contain the following information 11660
for each case with which the board has completed its activities: 11661
(a) The case number assigned to the complaint or alleged 11662
violation; 11663
(b) The type of license or certificate to practice, if 11664
any, held by the individual against whom the complaint is 11665
directed; 11666
(c) A description of the allegations contained in the 11667
complaint; 11668
(d) Whether witnesses were interviewed; 11669

(f) The disposition of the case. 11672
The report shall state how many cases are still pending 11673
and shall be prepared in a manner that protects the identity of 11674
each person involved in each case. The report shall be a public 11675
record under section 149.43 of the Revised Code. 11676
(7) The board may provide a status update regarding an 11677
investigation to a complainant on request if the board verifies 11678

(G)(1) If either of the following circumstances occur, the 11680
secretary and supervising member may recommend that the board 11681
suspend an individual's license or certificate to practice or 11682
certificate to recommend without a prior hearing: 11683
(a) The secretary and supervising member determine both of 11684
the following: 11685
(i) That there is clear and convincing evidence that an 11686
individual has violated division (B) of this section; 11687
(ii) That the individual's continued practice presents a 11688
danger of immediate and serious harm to the public. 11689
(b) The board receives verifiable information that a 11690
licensee has been charged in any state or federal court with a 11691
crime classified as a felony under the charging court's law and 11692
the conduct constitutes a violation of division (B) of this 11693
section. 11694
(2) If a recommendation is made to suspend without a prior 11695
hearing pursuant to division (G)(1) of this section, written 11696
allegations shall be prepared for consideration by the board. 11697
The board, upon review of those allegations and by an 11698
affirmative vote of not fewer than six of its members, excluding 11699
the secretary and supervising member, may suspend a license or 11700
certificate without a prior hearing. A telephone conference call 11701
may be utilized for reviewing the allegations and taking the 11702
vote on the summary suspension. 11703
The board shall serve a written order of suspension in 11704
accordance with sections 119.05 and 119.07 of the Revised Code. 11705
The order shall not be subject to suspension by the court during 11706

requests an adjudicatory hearing by the board, the date set for 11709
the hearing shall be within fifteen days, but not earlier than 11710
seven days, after the individual requests the hearing, unless 11711
otherwise agreed to by both the board and the individual. 11712
(3) Any summary suspension imposed under this division 11713
shall remain in effect, unless reversed on appeal, until a final 11714
adjudicative order issued by the board pursuant to this section 11715
and Chapter 119. of the Revised Code becomes effective. The 11716
board shall issue its final adjudicative order within seventy- 11717
five days after completion of its hearing. A failure to issue 11718
the order within seventy-five days shall result in dissolution 11719
of the summary suspension order but shall not invalidate any 11720
subsequent, final adjudicative order. 11721
(H) If the board takes action under division (B)(9), (11), 11722
or (13) of this section and the judicial finding of guilt, 11723
guilty plea, or judicial finding of eligibility for intervention 11724
in lieu of conviction is overturned on appeal, upon exhaustion 11725
of the criminal appeal, a petition for reconsideration of the 11726
order may be filed with the board along with appropriate court 11727
documents. Upon receipt of a petition of that nature and 11728
supporting court documents, the board shall reinstate the 11729
individual's license or certificate to practice. The board may 11730
then hold an adjudication under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code 11731
to determine whether the individual committed the act in 11732
question. Notice of an opportunity for a hearing shall be given 11733
in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code. If the 11734
board finds, pursuant to an adjudication held under this 11735
division, that the individual committed the act or if no hearing 11736
is requested, the board may order any of the sanctions 11737
identified under division (B) of this section. 11738

(I) The license or certificate to practice issued to an 11739
individual under this chapter and the individual's practice in 11740
this state are automatically suspended as of the date of the 11741
individual's second or subsequent plea of guilty to, or judicial 11742
finding of guilt of, a violation of section 2919.123 or 2919.124 11743

under this chapter and the individual's practice in this state 11746
are automatically suspended as of the date the individual pleads 11747
guilty to, is found by a judge or jury to be guilty of, or is 11748

The board shall notify the individual subject to the 11759
suspension in accordance with sections 119.05 and 119.07 of the 11760
Revised Code. If an individual whose license or certificate is 11761
automatically suspended under this division fails to make a 11762
timely request for an adjudication under Chapter 119. of the 11763
Revised Code, the board shall do whichever of the following is 11764
applicable: 11765
(1) If the automatic suspension under this division is for 11766
a second or subsequent plea of guilty to, or judicial finding of 11767

Revised Code to give notice of an opportunity for a hearing and 11778
if the individual subject to the notice does not timely request 11779
a hearing in accordance with section 119.07 of the Revised Code, 11780
the board is not required to hold a hearing, but may adopt, by 11781
an affirmative vote of not fewer than six of its members, a 11782

certificate to practice to an applicant, revokes an individual's 11796
license or certificate to practice, refuses to renew an 11797
individual's license or certificate to practice, or refuses to 11798
reinstate an individual's license or certificate to practice, 11799

the board may specify that its action is permanent. An 11800
individual subject to a permanent action taken by the board is 11801
forever thereafter ineligible to hold a license or certificate 11802
to practice and the board shall not accept an application for 11803
reinstatement of the license or certificate or for issuance of a 11804
new license or certificate. 11805

Code, all of the following apply: 11807
(1) The surrender of a license or certificate issued under 11808
this chapter shall not be effective unless or until accepted by 11809

certificate to practice in accordance with this chapter or a 11821
certificate to recommend in accordance with rules adopted under 11822
section 4731.301 of the Revised Code does not remove or limit 11823
the board's jurisdiction to take any disciplinary action under 11824
this section against the individual. 11825
(4) The placement of an individual's license on retired 11826
status, as described in section 4731.283 of the Revised Code, 11827
does not remove or limit the board's jurisdiction to take any 11828

disciplinary action against the individual with regard to the 11829
license as it existed before being placed on retired status. 11830

H. B. No. 353 Page 491
As Introduced
of the state highway patrol shall, by rule, define those 14097
administrative and clerical duties and those situations where 14098
the occurrence of an injury does not entitle the patrol officer 14099
to occupational injury leave. Each injury incurred in the line 14100
of duty which aggravates a previously existing injury, whether 14101
the previously existing injury was so incurred or not, shall be 14102
considered an independent injury. When its use is authorized 14103
under this section, all occupational injury leave shall be 14104
exhausted before any credit is deducted from unused sick leave 14105
accumulated under section 124.38 of the Revised Code, except 14106
that, unless otherwise provided by the superintendent of the 14107

work. 14116
Before a patrol officer may use occupational injury leave, 14117
the patrol officer shall: 14118
(A) Apply to the superintendent for permission to use 14119
occupational injury leave on a form that requires the patrol 14120
officer to explain the nature of the patrol officer's 14121
independent injury and the circumstances under which it 14122
occurred; and 14123
(B) Submit to a medical examination. The individual who 14124
conducts the examination shall report to the superintendent the 14125
results of the examination and whether or not the independent 14126

H. B. No. 353 Page 492
As Introduced
injury prevents the patrol officer from attending work. 14127
The superintendent shall, by rule, provide for periodic 14128
medical examinations of patrol officers who are using 14129
occupational injury leave. The individual selected to conduct 14130
the medical examinations shall report to the superintendent the 14131
results of each such examination, including a description of the 14132
progress made by the patrol officer in recovering from the 14133
independent injury, and whether or not the independent injury 14134
continues to prevent the patrol officer from attending work. 14135
The superintendent shall appoint to conduct medical 14136
examinations under this division individuals authorized by the 14137
Revised Code to do so, including any physician 14138
assistantassociate, clinical nurse specialist, certified nurse 14139
practitioner, or certified nurse-midwife. 14140
A patrol officer is not entitled to use or continue to use 14141
occupational injury leave after refusing to submit to a medical 14142
examination or if the individual examining the patrol officer 14143
reports that the independent injury does not prevent the patrol 14144
officer from attending work. 14145
A patrol officer who falsifies an application for 14146
permission to use occupational injury leave or a medical 14147
examination report is subject to disciplinary action, including 14148
dismissal. 14149
The superintendent shall, by rule, prescribe forms for the 14150
application and medical examination report. 14151
Occupational injury leave pay made according to this 14152
section is in lieu of such workers' compensation benefits as 14153
would have been payable directly to a patrol officer pursuant to 14154
sections 4123.56 and 4123.58 of the Revised Code, but all other 14155

H. B. No. 353 Page 493
As Introduced
compensation and benefits pursuant to Chapter 4123. of the 14156
Revised Code are payable as in any other case. If at the close 14157
of the period, the patrol officer remains disabled, the patrol 14158
officer is entitled to all compensation and benefits, without a 14159
waiting period pursuant to section 4123.55 of the Revised Code 14160
based upon the injury received, for which the patrol officer 14161
qualifies pursuant to Chapter 4123. of the Revised Code. 14162
Compensation shall be paid from the date that the patrol officer 14163
ceases to receive the patrol officer's regular rate of pay 14164
pursuant to this section. 14165
Occupational injury leave shall not be credited to or, 14166
upon use, deducted from, a patrol officer's sick leave. 14167
