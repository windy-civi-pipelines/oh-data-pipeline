establish a program to replace supplemental nutrition assistance 35
program benefits for households that have had benefits stolen on 36

theft. Benefits stolen before December 21, 2024, are ineligible 38
for replacement under the program. 39

apply for replacement benefits. The form shall include a place 41
for a recipient's signature, attesting that the household did 42

(2) If an incident of electronic benefit theft occurs over 59
the course of several transactions or days, calculations for the 60
amount of replacement benefits for purposes of division (D)(1) 61
(b) of this section shall be based on the date of the first 62
occurrence of the electronic benefit theft. 63

the household fifteen calendar days to submit an updated form 84
that includes the requested information. 85
