factors under section 2929.12 of the Revised Code indicating a 568
lesser likelihood of recidivism outweigh the applicable factors 569

was less serious than conduct normally constituting the offense 576

regarding the violation. 590
(2) If an offender who was convicted of or pleaded guilty 591
to a felony violates the conditions of a community control 592
sanction imposed for the offense solely by reason of producing 593
positive results on a drug test, the court, as punishment for 594
the violation of the sanction, shall not order that the offender 595
be imprisoned unless the court determines on the record either 596
of the following: 597

offense that is a felony of the third, fourth, or fifth degree 607
may require that the offender be assessed by a properly 608
credentialed professional within a specified period of time. The 609
court shall require the professional to file a written 610
assessment of the offender with the court. If the offender is 611
eligible for a community control sanction and after considering 612
the written assessment, the court may impose a community control 613
sanction that includes addiction services and recovery supports 614
included in a community-based continuum of care established 615
under section 340.032 of the Revised Code. If the court imposes 616
addiction services and recovery supports as a community control 617
sanction, the court shall direct the level and type of addiction 618
services and recovery supports after considering the assessment 619
and recommendation of community addiction services providers. 620

jail, a community-based correctional facility, a halfway house, 816
or an alternative residential facility, and the offender shall 817
serve the term in the type of facility specified by the court. A 818
mandatory term of local incarceration imposed under division (G) 819
(1) of this section is not subject to any other Revised Code 820
provision that pertains to a prison term except as provided in 821
division (A)(1) of this section. 822

an offender who once has been sentenced to a mandatory term of 843
local incarceration pursuant to division (G)(1) of this section 844
for a fourth degree felony OVI offense be sentenced to another 845
mandatory term of local incarceration under that division for 846

division (G)(2) of this section, the court may sentence the 849
offender to a community control sanction under section 2929.16 850
or 2929.17 of the Revised Code, but the offender shall serve the 851

in relation to an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty 903
to an attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the 904

if that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved 909
an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance 910
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance 911
amounts than was involved in the attempt. 912

meaning as in section 5119.01 of the Revised Code. 915
(2) "Drug abuse offense" has the same meaning as in 916

Section 57:
section 2925.01 of the Revised Code. 917
(3) "Minor drug possession offense" has the same meaning 918

provision in division (C)(4)(e), (C)(4)(f), (C)(8)(b), or (C)(9) 922
(b) of that section applies. 923
(L) At the time of sentencing an offender for any sexually 924
oriented offense, if the offender is a tier III sex 925
offender/child-victim offender relative to that offense and the 926
offender does not serve a prison term or jail term, the court 927
may require that the offender be monitored by means of a global 928
H. B. No. 79 Page 33

positioning device. If the court requires such monitoring, the 929
cost of monitoring shall be borne by the offender. If the 930

the crime victims reparations fund. 932

Section 59:
Section 2. That existing sections 2903.13 and 2929.13 of 933

Chapter 2925., 3719., or 4729. of the Revised Code for which a 543
presumption in favor of a prison term is specified as being 544
applicable, and for a violation of division (A)(4) or (B) of 545
section 2907.05 of the Revised Code for which a presumption in 546
favor of a prison term is specified as being applicable, it is 547
presumed that a prison term is necessary in order to comply with 548
the purposes and principles of sentencing under section 2929.11 549
of the Revised Code. Division (D)(2) of this section does not 550
apply to a presumption established under this division for a 551
violation of division (A)(4) of section 2907.05 of the Revised 552
Code. 553
(2) Notwithstanding the presumption established under 554
division (D)(1) of this section for the offenses listed in that 555
division other than a violation of division (A)(4) or (B) of 556
section 2907.05 of the Revised Code, the sentencing court may 557

Chapter 2925., 3719., or 4729. of the Revised Code for which a 562
presumption in favor of a prison term is specified as being 563
applicable if it makes both of the following findings: 564
(a) A community control sanction or a combination of 565
community control sanctions would adequately punish the offender 566
and protect the public from future crime, because the applicable 567
factors under section 2929.12 of the Revised Code indicating a 568
lesser likelihood of recidivism outweigh the applicable factors 569
under that section indicating a greater likelihood of 570
recidivism. 571

H. B. No. 79 Page 21
As Introduced
(b) A community control sanction or a combination of 572
community control sanctions would not demean the seriousness of 573
the offense, because one or more factors under section 2929.12 574
of the Revised Code that indicate that the offender's conduct 575
was less serious than conduct normally constituting the offense 576
are applicable, and they outweigh the applicable factors under 577
that section that indicate that the offender's conduct was more 578
serious than conduct normally constituting the offense. 579
(E)(1) Except as provided in division (F) of this section, 580
for any drug offense that is a violation of any provision of 581
Chapter 2925. of the Revised Code and that is a felony of the 582
third, fourth, or fifth degree, the applicability of a 583
presumption under division (D) of this section in favor of a 584
prison term or of division (B) or (C) of this section in 585
determining whether to impose a prison term for the offense 586
shall be determined as specified in section 2925.02, 2925.03, 587
2925.04, 2925.05, 2925.06, 2925.11, 2925.13, 2925.22, 2925.23, 588
2925.36, or 2925.37 of the Revised Code, whichever is applicable 589
regarding the violation. 590
(2) If an offender who was convicted of or pleaded guilty 591
to a felony violates the conditions of a community control 592
sanction imposed for the offense solely by reason of producing 593
positive results on a drug test, the court, as punishment for 594
the violation of the sanction, shall not order that the offender 595
be imprisoned unless the court determines on the record either 596
of the following: 597
(a) The offender had been ordered as a sanction for the 598
felony to participate in a drug treatment program, in a drug 599
education program, or in narcotics anonymous or a similar 600
program, and the offender continued to use illegal drugs after a 601

H. B. No. 79 Page 22
As Introduced
reasonable period of participation in the program. 602
(b) The imprisonment of the offender for the violation is 603
consistent with the purposes and principles of sentencing set 604
forth in section 2929.11 of the Revised Code. 605
(3) A court that sentences an offender for a drug abuse 606
offense that is a felony of the third, fourth, or fifth degree 607
may require that the offender be assessed by a properly 608
credentialed professional within a specified period of time. The 609
court shall require the professional to file a written 610
assessment of the offender with the court. If the offender is 611
eligible for a community control sanction and after considering 612
the written assessment, the court may impose a community control 613
sanction that includes addiction services and recovery supports 614
included in a community-based continuum of care established 615
under section 340.032 of the Revised Code. If the court imposes 616
addiction services and recovery supports as a community control 617
sanction, the court shall direct the level and type of addiction 618
services and recovery supports after considering the assessment 619

offender, at the time of sentencing, of those duties and of 888
their duration. If required under division (A)(2) of section 889
2950.03 of the Revised Code, the judge shall perform the duties 890
specified in that section, or, if required under division (A)(6) 891
of section 2950.03 of the Revised Code, the judge shall perform 892
the duties specified in that division. 893

section, when considering sentencing factors under this section 895
in relation to an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty 896

in relation to an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty 903
to an attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the 904

the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense, the 906
sentencing court shall consider the factors applicable to the 907
felony category that the drug abuse offense attempted would be 908
if that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved 909
an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance 910
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance 911
amounts than was involved in the attempt. 912

provision in division (C)(4)(e), (C)(4)(f), (C)(8)(b), or (C)(9) 922
(b) of that section applies. 923
(L) At the time of sentencing an offender for any sexually 924
oriented offense, if the offender is a tier III sex 925
offender/child-victim offender relative to that offense and the 926
offender does not serve a prison term or jail term, the court 927
may require that the offender be monitored by means of a global 928

cost of monitoring shall be borne by the offender. If the 930
offender is indigent, the cost of compliance shall be paid by 931
the crime victims reparations fund. 932
Section 2. That existing sections 2903.13 and 2929.13 of 933
the Revised Code are hereby repealed. 934
