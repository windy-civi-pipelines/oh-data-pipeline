(I) At the time of sentencing, the court may recommend the 1261

offender is eligible for the placement. 1272

the recommended program or prison, the department shall send a 1286
notice to the court indicating why the offender was not placed 1287
in the recommended program or prison. 1288
If the court does not make a recommendation under this 1289
division with respect to an offender and if the department 1290
determines as specified in section 5120.031 or 5120.032 of the 1291
Revised Code, whichever is applicable, that the offender is 1292
eligible for placement in a program or prison of that nature, 1293
the department shall screen the offender and determine if there 1294
is an available program of shock incarceration or an intensive 1295
program prison for which the offender is suited. If there is an 1296
available program of shock incarceration or an intensive program 1297
prison for which the offender is suited, the department shall 1298
notify the court of the proposed placement of the offender as 1299
specified in section 5120.031 or 5120.032 of the Revised Code 1300

control while committing the presently charged violent felony 1317
offense and displayed or brandished the firearm, indicated that 1318
the offender possessed a firearm, or used the firearm to 1319
facilitate the offense. The offender shall serve the prison term 1320
imposed under this division consecutively to and prior to the 1321
prison term imposed for the underlying offense. The prison term 1322
shall not be reduced pursuant to section 2929.20, division (A) 1323
(2) or (3) of section 2967.193 or 2967.194, or any other 1324
provision of Chapter 2967. or 5120. of the Revised Code. A court 1325

imprisonment without parole, a sentence of life imprisonment, a 1333
definite sentence, or a sentence to an indefinite prison term 1334
under this chapter for a felony offense that was committed when 1335
the offender was under eighteen years of age, the offender's 1336
parole eligibility shall be determined under section 2967.132 of 1337
the Revised Code. 1338
Sec. 2941.1427. (A) Imposition of a five-year mandatory 1339
prison term upon an offender under division (B)(12) of section 1340

specifies that the offender moved or removed human remains to 1343
prevent the discovery of an unlawful act, the discovery of the 1344

the human remains. The specification shall be stated at the end 1346
of the body of the indictment, count, or information, and shall 1347

(set forth that the offender moved or removed human remains to 1352
