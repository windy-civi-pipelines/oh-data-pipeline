prescription from the person's health care provider prescribing 113
such a placard for the person based upon a determination that 114
the person meets at least one of the criteria contained in 115
division (A)(1) of this section. The health care provider shall 116
state on the prescription the length of time the health care 117
provider expects the applicant to have the disability that 118
limits or impairs the person's ability to walk. If the length of 119
time the applicant is expected to have the disability is six 120
consecutive months or less, the applicant shall submit an 121
application for a temporary removable windshield placard. If the 122
length of time the applicant is expected to have the disability 123
is permanent, the applicant shall submit an application for a 124
permanent removable windshield placard. All other applicants 125
shall submit an application for a standard removable windshield 126
placard. 127
(3) In addition to one placard or one or more sets of 128
license plates, a person with a disability that limits or 129
impairs the ability to walk is entitled to one additional 130
placard, but only if the person applies separately for the 131
additional placard, states the reasons why the additional 132
placard is needed, and the registrar, in the registrar's 133
discretion determines that good and justifiable cause exists to 134
approve the request for the additional placard. 135
(4) An organization may apply to the registrar of motor 136
vehicles for a standard removable windshield placard by 137
completing and signing an application provided by the registrar. 138

H. B. No. 526 Page 6
As Introduced
The organization shall comply with any procedures the registrar 139
establishes by rule. The organization shall include with the 140
application documentary evidence that the registrar requires by 141
rule showing that the organization regularly transports persons 142
with disabilities that limit or impair the ability to walk. 143
(5) The registrar or deputy registrar shall issue to an 144
applicant a standard removable windshield placard, a temporary 145
removable windshield placard, or a permanent removable 146
windshield placard, as applicable, upon receipt of all of the 147
following: 148
(a) A completed and signed application for a removable 149
windshield placard; 150
(b) The accompanying documents required under division (C) 151
(2) or (4) of this section; 152
(c) Payment of a service fee equal to the amount 153
established under section 4503.038 of the Revised Code for a 154
standard removable windshield placard or a temporary removable 155
windshield placard, or payment of fifteen dollars for a 156
permanent removable windshield placard. 157
(6) The removable windshield placard shall display the 158
date of expiration on both sides of the placard, or the word 159
"permanent" if the placard is a permanent removable windshield 160
placard, and shall be valid until expired, revoked, or 161
surrendered. Except for a permanent removable windshield 162
placard, which has no expiration, a removable windshield placard 163
expires on the earliest of the following two dates: 164
(a) The date that the person issued the placard is 165
expected to no longer have the disability that limits or impairs 166
the ability to walk, as indicated on the prescription submitted 167

H. B. No. 526 Page 7
As Introduced
with the application for the placard; 168
(b) Ten years after the date of issuance on the placard. 169
In no case shall a removable windshield placard be valid 170
for a period of less than sixty days. 171
(7) Standard removable windshield placards shall be 172
renewable upon application and upon payment of a service fee 173
equal to the amount established under section 4503.038 of the 174
Revised Code. The registrar shall provide the application form 175
and shall determine the information to be included thereon. 176
(8) The registrar shall determine the form and size of 177
each type of the removable windshield placard, the material of 178
which it is to be made, any differences in color between each 179
type of placard to make them readily identifiable, and any other 180
information to be included thereon, and shall adopt rules 181
relating to the issuance, expiration, revocation, surrender, and 182
proper display of such placards. A temporary removable 183
windshield placard shall display the word "temporary" in letters 184
of such size as the registrar shall prescribe. Any placard 185
issued after October 14, 1999, shall be manufactured in a manner 186
that allows the expiration date of the placard to be indicated 187
on it through the punching, drilling, boring, or creation by any 188
other means of holes in the placard. 189
(9) In addition to the design of the removable windshield 190
placard specified in division (C)(8) of this section, the 191
registrar shall provide for and issue an orange removable 192
windshield placard with a white international symbol of access 193
imprinted on it. A person with a disability that limits or 194
impairs the ability to walk whose disability is not readily 195
apparent to another person may apply to the registrar for a 196

H. B. No. 526 Page 8

placard in accordance with division (C)(9) of this section. The 197
placard shall otherwise be created with the same form, size, and 198
material, and shall display the same information as the placard 199
issued in accordance with division (C)(8) of this section. All 200
other requirements established under this section and under 201
rules relating to the issuance, expiration, revocation, 202
surrender, and proper display of a placard shall apply. Nothing 203
in this division shall be construed to require a person to apply 204
for and obtain a placard issued in accordance with division (C) 205
(9) of this section. 206
(9)(10) At the time a removable windshield placard is 207
issued to a person with a disability that limits or impairs the 208
ability to walk, the registrar or deputy registrar shall enter 209
into the records of the bureau of motor vehicles the last date 210
on which the person will have that disability, as indicated on 211
the accompanying prescription. For a standard removable 212
windshield placard, not less than thirty days prior to that date 213
and any renewal dates, the bureau shall send a renewal notice to 214
that person at the person's last known address as shown in the 215
records of the bureau, informing the person that the person's 216
removable windshield placard will expire on the indicated date, 217
and that the person is required to renew the placard by 218
submitting to the registrar or a deputy registrar another 219
prescription, and by complying with the renewal provisions. If 220
such a prescription is not received by the registrar or a deputy 221
registrar by that date, the placard issued to that person 222
expires and no longer is valid, and this fact shall be recorded 223
in the records of the bureau. 224
(10)(11) At least once every year, on a date determined by 225
the registrar, the bureau shall examine the records of the 226
office of vital statistics, located within the department of 227

records of all persons who have been issued removable windshield 229
placards. If the records of the office of vital statistics 230
indicate that a person to whom a removable windshield placard 231
has been issued is deceased, the bureau shall cancel that 232
placard, and note the cancellation in its records. 233
The office of vital statistics shall make available to the 234
bureau all information necessary to enable the bureau to comply 235
with division (C)(10)(C)(11) of this section. 236
(11)(12) Nothing in this section shall be construed to 237
require a person or organization to apply for a removable 238
windshield placard or accessible license plates if the 239
accessible license plates issued to the person or organization 240
under prior law have not expired or been surrendered or revoked. 241
(D) Any active-duty member of the armed forces of the 242
United States, including the reserve components of the armed 243
forces and the national guard, who has an illness or injury that 244
limits or impairs the ability to walk may apply to the registrar 245
or a deputy registrar for a temporary removable windshield 246
placard. With the application, the person shall present evidence 247
of the person's active-duty status and the illness or injury. 248
Evidence of the illness or injury may include a current 249
department of defense convalescent leave statement, any 250
department of defense document indicating that the person 251
currently has an ill or injured casualty status or has limited 252
duties, or a prescription from any health care provider 253
prescribing the placard for the applicant. Upon receipt of the 254
application and the necessary evidence, the registrar or deputy 255

windshield placard without the payment of any service fee. 257

receipt of the application, presentation of a signed statement 262
from the applicant's health care provider certifying the 263

evidence from the department of veterans affairs that the 265
disability of the applicant meets at least one of the criteria 266
identified in division (A)(1) of this section and is service- 267
