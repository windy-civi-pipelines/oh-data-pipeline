demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect 1080
the public from future crime by the offender. 1081

offender is eligible for the placement. 1292
If the court disapproves placement of the offender in a 1293
program or prison of that nature, the department of 1294
rehabilitation and correction shall not place the offender in 1295
any program of shock incarceration or intensive program prison. 1296

notice to the court indicating why the offender was not placed 1307
in the recommended program or prison. 1308

division with respect to an offender and if the department 1310

H. B. No. 236 Page 45

determines as specified in section 5120.031 or 5120.032 of the 1311

eligible for placement in a program or prison of that nature, 1313
the department shall screen the offender and determine if there 1314
is an available program of shock incarceration or an intensive 1315
program prison for which the offender is suited. If there is an 1316
available program of shock incarceration or an intensive program 1317
prison for which the offender is suited, the department shall 1318
notify the court of the proposed placement of the offender as 1319
specified in section 5120.031 or 5120.032 of the Revised Code 1320

prison term of two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 1330
ten, or eleven years on an offender who is convicted of or 1331
pleads guilty to a violent felony offense if the offender also 1332
is convicted of or pleads guilty to a specification of the type 1333
described in section 2941.1424 of the Revised Code that charges 1334
that the offender is a violent career criminal and had a firearm 1335
on or about the offender's person or under the offender's 1336
control while committing the presently charged violent felony 1337
offense and displayed or brandished the firearm, indicated that 1338
the offender possessed a firearm, or used the firearm to 1339
facilitate the offense. The offender shall serve the prison term 1340
imposed under this division consecutively to and prior to the 1341

prison term imposed for the underlying offense. The prison term 1342
shall not be reduced pursuant to section 2929.20, division (A) 1343
(2) or (3) of section 2967.193 or 2967.194, or any other 1344
provision of Chapter 2967. or 5120. of the Revised Code. A court 1345
may not impose more than one sentence under division (B)(2)(a) 1346
of this section and this division for acts committed as part of 1347
the same act or transaction. 1348
(2) As used in division (K)(1) of this section, "violent 1349
career criminal" and "violent felony offense" have the same 1350

imprisonment without parole, a sentence of life imprisonment, a 1353
definite sentence, or a sentence to an indefinite prison term 1354

the offender was under eighteen years of age, the offender's 1356
parole eligibility shall be determined under section 2967.132 of 1357
the Revised Code. 1358
Sec. 2941.1427. (A) Imposition of a one-year mandatory 1359
prison term upon an offender under division (B)(12) of section 1360
2929.14 of the Revised Code is precluded unless the indictment, 1361
count in the indictment, or information charging the offense 1362
specifies that the offender wore a mask or other disguise or 1363
otherwise concealed or attempted to conceal the offender's face 1364
while committing the offense and that the offense is a felony. 1365
The specification shall be stated at the end of the body of the 1366
indictment, count, or information and shall be stated in 1367
substantially the following form: 1368
"SPECIFICATION (or, SPECIFICATION TO THE FIRST COUNT). The 1369
Grand Jurors (or insert the person's or the prosecuting 1370
attorney's name when appropriate) further find and specify that 1371

H. B. No. 236 Page 47

(set forth that the offender wore a mask or disguise or 1372
otherwise concealed or attempted to conceal the offender's face 1373
while committing the specified offense and that the specified 1374
offense is a felony)." 1375
(B) The specification described in division (A) of this 1376
section may be used in a delinquent child proceeding in the 1377
manner and for the purpose described in section 2152.17 of the 1378
Revised Code. 1379
Section 2. That existing sections 2152.17, 2911.21, 1380
2917.02, and 2929.14 of the Revised Code are hereby repealed. 1381
Section 3. Section 2929.14 of the Revised Code is 1382
presented in this act as a composite of the section as amended 1383
by H.B. 37, H.B. 56, H.B. 111, and S.B. 106, all of the 135th 1384
General Assembly. The General Assembly, applying the principle 1385
stated in division (B) of section 1.52 of the Revised Code that 1386
amendments are to be harmonized if reasonably capable of 1387
simultaneous operation, finds that the composite is the 1388
resulting version of the section in effect prior to the 1389
effective date of the section as presented in this act. 1390
