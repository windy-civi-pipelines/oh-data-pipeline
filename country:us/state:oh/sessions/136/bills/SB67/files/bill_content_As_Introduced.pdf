assignment to the department of job and family services of any 257
rights members of an assistance group have to support from any 258
other person. The rights to support assigned to the department 259
pursuant to this section constitute an obligation of the person 260
who is responsible for providing the support to the state for 261
the amount of cash assistance provided to the assistance group. 262
(C) The office of child support in the department of job 263
and family services shall collect and distribute support 264
