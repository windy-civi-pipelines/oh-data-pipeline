the United States workforce, with an unemployment rate of 13.2% 14

As Reported by the Senate Workforce Development Committee
WHEREAS, Business owners could more quickly return to 19
regular operations, including resuming their usual open hours, 20
by being able to hire the necessary staff to meet their 21
operating needs; and 22
WHEREAS, The Fair Labor Standards Act and Ohio law permits 23
a person under 16 years of age to work until 9 p.m. during 24
summer months or other school holidays; and 25
WHEREAS, Extending the hours which a person under 16 years 26
of age may work during the school year allows business owners to 27
hire the staff required for the business to resume operating 28
during its usual hours of operation; and 29
WHEREAS, Local economic growth results when more people are 30
employed and earn wages to spend on goods and services produced 31
by businesses within the local area, which in turn requires 32
businesses to hire more workers to meet the increased demand; 33
now therefore be it 34
RESOLVED, That we, the members of the 136th General 35
Assembly of the State of Ohio, urge the Congress of the United 36
States to make changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act to allow 37
a person under 16 years of age to be employed between 7 p.m. and 38
9 p.m. during the school year if the person has approval to do 39
so from the person's parent or legal guardian; and be it further 40
RESOLVED, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit duly 41
authenticated copies of this resolution to the President Pro 42
Tempore and Secretary of the United States Senate, the Speaker 43
and Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, the 44
members of the Ohio Congressional delegation, and the news media 45
of Ohio. 46
